         <div class="more">
          <p>For middle school mathematics teachers, finding a STEM application for angle relationships can be a struggle. During this workshop, attendees with participate in a lesson called “Angling Your Neighborhood”. This lesson uses inquiry to discover different angle relationships. As attendees discover these relationships, they are challenged to use them to develop a neighborhood roadway system. By mixing inquiry with an engineering task, attendees are able to help their students develop the appropriate mathematics knowledge while applying that knowledge in a creative design and build activity. By participating in this hands-on lesson, attendees will be prepared to take this ready-made activity back to their middle school math classrooms. The activity is designed for the Virginia Math 8 Standards of Learning but can be adapted to the needs of sixth and seventh grade math by changing the criteria of the engineering task. </p>

         <div class="more">
          <p>Today there are a number of astronomical tools (telescopes, cameras, software, websites...) available that an educator can use to enhance their student’s learning experience. It can be a daunting task wading through all the options, and choosing the right one is not always easy. Once you have made your choice learning to use the tool can also be a time consuming task; where do you turn to for help? In this workshop we will give you an introduction to what’s available in the way of tools and resources that are suitable for various education levels. From free to pricey we give you a rundown on what’s out there, the “good, the bad, and the ugly”, and where to get help. We will present the basics of how to choose and use binoculars, telescopes, cameras, and software as well as what to look for, and look out for, when it’s time for you to make your choice. Weather permitting there will be an optional observing session in the evening. (See the schedule for details.)&nbsp;</p>

After equations are graphed, instructions will be to create a piece of art that uses color and texture to relate to some aspect of their life. As art is completed, comparisons of the “chevron” that emerges will be relevant to relating the art to the project-based experience. A presentation will follow using students’ work of the “Stained Glass” project. Sixth grade students began with a mini-lesson in art appreciation, followed by graphing the same equations (VDOE) on larger paper. Periodic check-ins using todaysmeet.com were relevant to discuss various problems that students were having while navigating equations. Students gave feedback on each other's art, learning, through the project, slope and y-intercept form and key elements to linear functions from a very elementary understanding (6th – 8th grade curriculum). Students wrote a synopsis of what the artistic elements meant to them and how they chose to use materials and various elements to set the tone of the work of art. Students wrote a paper using google docs relating the art to the mathematics in a formal five-paragraph format. Attendees will take away all handouts/rubrics, etc. Numerous examples of student work will be used to explain the project and extend attendees view of what students can do when given the freedom to think critically and creatively! The session will culminate brainstorming ways that this project can be enhanced or ways students’ work can be published.&nbsp;</p>

         <div class="more">
          <p>The Creative and Real-World Engaging Experiences Realized this Summer (CAREERS) program was created for at-risk and low performing 7th and 8th grade students as an alternative to a traditional summer school. Furthermore, research has shown that college and career readiness should be started in the middle school to help assess personal interest and future goals through career exploration. The program hired teachers to create project-based learning units that were created around the 16 career clusters. Each project focused on competencies of problem solving, flexibility, collaboration and time management. It also embedded reading and math skills. The culminating project was for students to select one project and create a visual representation of the process of how they worked to create a project to answer a driving question or solve a challenge. In addition, students researched a potential career cluster of interest and presented it to community members. The hands-on presentation will showcase the many projects that included some STEM PBL (MakerSpace, water rocket science, textile engineering), technologically related projects (t-shirt shop) and the culminating project. Participants will examine the projects at different stations and fill out a handout that will prompt them to ask questions, write observations and how it could be used in other schools. After the activity, the presenters will answer questions, discuss the benefits and lessons learned from the program. The attendees will receive ideas and ways to incorporate project-based learning units that include STEM and technology into their curriculum. The SOLSs covered will be non-fiction reading skills, physical science SOLs and various math standards.</p>

Coding is a skill that teaches students strategy, problem-solving, and breaking down tasks. Teachers are intrigued with coding but are not sure where to start. Through this session we will help you figure out where can you start and where can you go? Participants will learn about apps, websites and toys that will spark the coding curiosity of elementary and middle school students. You will even have a chance to control toys through your own code. We will end the session talking about school-wide programs and parent-involved activities to expand the coding experience in your school. No experience necessary. (Hands-On)</p>

          <p>THIS IS A HANDS-ON WORKSHOP REQUIRING PARTICIPANTS TO BRING THEIR OWN LAPTOP COMPUTERS.</p>
          <p>If coding is the new literacy, how do we make it relevant within the context of student learning? Join two elementary educators from Albemarle County Public Schools in an experiential investigation of infusing coding and electronics into the curriculum. Participants will explore Arduino micro controllers (http://www.arduino.cc/) and Scratch programming (https://scratch.mit.edu/). Discover how Scratch is useful for making interactive scenes, video games, and more, while Arduino empowers students to add responsive, electronic elements to any item. Both platforms promote problem solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning while naturally introducing challenges and community investigation along the way. Come to this hands-on session ready to tinker, play, and create your own products. You will learn as a student by writing code, setting up a circuit to make a light blink using Arduino, or animating a figure in Scratch as an introduction, developing your own strategies for problem solving with the challenges presented! Even those with no prior experience will be poised to take these tools into classrooms immediately. Provide your students with yet another set of tools that they can use to solve meaningful problems and make sense of learning in any content area in elementary school and beyond. The possibilities are endless!</p>

          <p>In order to implement an effective STEM program in a rural school district, one must understand the nature and needs of such unique communities. This session will discuss the five components of developing a high school STEM program. The first component will focus on the use of incorporating data so that the division recognizes the need for STEM initiatives. This may even include assisting in dissolving traditional district boundaries. Component two will focus on identifying stakeholders who would develop a steering committee, community partnerships (community, local industry and post-secondary education) and an advocate for the process. This component will show that a rural community needs to come together with resources to create a lasting and effective STEM education infrastructure. This leads into the third component, Professional development and fourth component, Technology. It is extremely important that educators within the division adopt and are trained in the effective use of technology and distance learning. The final component is the capstone of the program which includes internships and the inclusion of CTE programs.<br><br>This workshop covers integrated STEM for teachers and administrators with students in grades 3-8.</p>

          <p>We all know children love to build, create, tear down, start over, and have fun and Goochland County Public Schools has implemented “Children’s Engineering” to give students these experiences. This program engages students in hands-on, problem-based learning where they apply learned knowledge as they “engineer” solutions to challenges their teachers give them. The “challenge” is designed by the teacher and often involves a book the students have read or a unit they are studying. The “challenge” may involve creating, designing, building, or experimenting, while the kids are having fun. Children’s Engineering is not designed to make every child an engineer, but they are “engineering” solutions to challenges. Students are engaged and having so much fun while learning.</p>

         <div class="more">
          <p>Physical computing is defined as making things happen in the physical world by running programs on a computer such as a microcontroller. Physical actions can range from the very simple—blinking an LED—to the very complex—a robot exploring its environment. The Arduino is a single-board microcontroller-based system for implementing physical computing systems. It has its own programming language called Wiring which is touted as easy to learn and is well supported on the web. The Arduino has become the “go to” computer of the Maker Movement. In this workshop, participants will learn to develop and program simple interfaces using the Arduino and its integrated development environment (IDE). Classroom applications, such as automated measurements of experiment data, will be discussed.</p>

           <u>Description</u>
           <strong>:<br><br></strong>&nbsp;This workshop will address the social, academic and behavior implications of designing an accelerated math program of middle school age African American males. Emphasis is placed on understanding the impact of teaching and learning preferences associated with the cultures of African American learners. The presenters will share the program design, examples of effective practices and allow time for group interaction.

          <p>This workshop covers mathematics, mentoring and problem based learning for grades 5-8 and administrators.</p>
          <p><u>About the partnership and program</u>:&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The 2009 partnership with the Albemarle County Public Schools and the 100 Black Men of Central Virginia is a recent and notable school and community educational reform initiative. Dr. Hairston serves as the founding president of this mentoring organization to address the achievement gap of African American males. He is an advocate for increasing the knowledge base of teachers around culturally responsive research based teaching practices that’s inclusive of valuing the importance of getting to know students around their culture, teaching to backgrounds and experiences and involving the home in the learning process. He has taught on the middle school and college levels and served as a middle school and high school principal in the public sector.&nbsp;<br><br>Albemarle County Public Schools (ACPS) addresses the needs of all students. Division data suggests that African American males are underachieving in the classrooms. In response the Superintendent of Schools and the School Board collaborated with the division’s Office of Community Engagement to establish partnerships with State Farm Insurance (funding); the University of Virginia’s School of Education (research and development support); and the 100 Black Men of Central Virginia (mentoring support) to assist in eliminating this achievement gap.<br><br>Through this partnership the M-Cubed program was created in 2009 and has flourished. M-Cubed stands for Math-Men-Mission and its goal is to produce an increase in the enrollment of African American young men in upper level course work, growth in personal expectations, and the development of grounded family and civic minded young men. By creating an atmosphere of successful academic experiences, rigorous pre-algebra curriculum and the establishment of a systemic support system; success was achieved.</p>
          <p>Albemarle County Public Schools was honored as the grand prize winner in the 5,000 to 20,000 enrollment category for M-cubed: Math, Men and Mission, a program developed to improve the academic achievement of African-American male students and encourage them to enroll in higher level math classes. The program starts with a two-week summer academy for upper elementary and middle school students and extends throughout the year with mentoring and academic support from the 100 Black Men of Central Virginia; a community group. </p>

This proposal offers an overview of a year-long technology professional development for local educators. As part of our commitment to the local K-12 schools, we offered a year-long professional development called the Educational Technology Leadership Academy. The model was that one teacher representing each elementary, middle, and high school in the three community school systems (Buena Vista, Lexington, and Rockbridge) was invited to attend this workshop. Participants were expected to attend the summer academy and attend six afterschool follow-up sessions over the following year. (Three Fall, Three Spring) Participants received free tuition for the one-credit summer course and renewal credits for all follow-up meetings. As part of this conference presentation I would share: • How we partnered with Educational Technology Leaders across three school systems • How we chose teacher leaders to attend the workshop • The content we shared during our week-long academy and follow-up meetings • How we offered renewal credits for teachers for self-designed PD • What we learned as part of year-long process This presentation would be a PPT with time for a Q&amp;A.

          <p>Too often educators cannot connect the concepts they are teaching to STEM fields or believe their subjects have nothing to do with STEM. This presentation will present how to integrate SOLs from multiple courses in a practical integration to help students learn multiple objectives from different academic disciplines. Attendees will learn curriculum mapping skills that can help align multiple SOLs in any course combination. Attendees will also cover different examples of lesson plans that infused 6th grade math SOLs with 6th grade US History, as well as lessons combining 8th grade science SOLs with World Geography SOLs. Group discussion will allow for participants to share questions and concerns, which will then be used to drive our conversation. Groups will then work together to develop their own lesson plans that integrate and assess at least 3 SOLs from at least two courses. Advanced integration will be touched on (the merging of three or more core subjects with as many SOLs at the same time).

          <p>The Aquaponics Discovery Lab at Potomac Middle School continues to be the first middle school lab in Northern Virginia to focus on aquaponics and sustainable urban farming. Our lab is at the forefront of the Potomac Middle School S.T.E.M. initiative, which aims to further evolve ours and similar programs to the entirety of our student body. In our Aquaponics Discovery Lab we focus on real world applications that are relevant to our students’ needs. As our school is located in the center of a FDA defined food desert, our students directly benefit from learning how to grow their own produce in a sustainable manner. Through the integrated use of Science: concepts for growing produce and maintaining aquariums; Technology: monitoring of nutrient levels and soil/water quality via Vernier probes and handheld devices; Engineering: for designing and implementing continuing expansions and modifications to our aquaponics system; and Math: by requiring students to complete calculations, collect and graph data, while working to expand to our own business practices. To date, students have built four different types of aquaponics systems, monitored the growth of multiple varieties of herbs and vegetables, presented their program in front of the School Board, and hosted a presentation for our first annual Science Day. These accomplishments were all secondary to the benefits of learning focused on sustainable living and urban farming practices.

          <p>It is a common misconception that an introduction to computer programming should start in front of a computer writing code. There are many barriers that one must address when teaching this information, and the unfortunate reality is that the most common strategy used in classrooms across America only works for a small percentage of learners, and it can be detrimental to someone developing a knowledge and passion for writing code. In this workshop, we will learn to address these issues by going on a journey looking at methodologies that I have used to help ease students into computer programming along with gaining insight into adjusted curriculum that took students from falling asleep at the site of code and morphed them into actively engaged learners. This workshop will be specifically tailored for Arduino microcontroller programming, but all methods are applicable no matter what language or technology someone is teaching. No experience in programming required. Prepare for an energy packed presentation that will help catalyze your student’s learning.</p>
