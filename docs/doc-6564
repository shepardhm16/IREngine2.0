          <br>He is currently developing two projects which will lead to further research outcomes. The first focuses on the response of US presidents to the Northern Ireland conflict during the ‘Troubles’. It will contribute to the relatively marginalised historiography of the Irish dimension of Anglo-American relations. The second is an examination of the relationship between Reagan and Thomas P. ‘Tip’ O’Neill (D-MA.), Speaker of the US House of Representatives, during the 1980s. It will be a timely study given the extent of partisan division in contemporary American politics.
