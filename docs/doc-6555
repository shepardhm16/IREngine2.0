         <h2>Day 1 Lunch Speaker</h2>
         <a href="#" class="readMore">Christopher Soghoian, Ph.D.</a>
         <div class="more">
          <img border="2" align="right" title="Christopher Soghoian, Ph.D." alt="Christopher Soghoian, Ph.D." src="/uploadedImages/Conferences/Leadership/Honor_Conference/Images/FR_22928_1C0A9560-Christopher Soghoian headshot.jpeg?n=6179" style="width: 200px;">Described by 
          <em>Wired</em> Magazine as the “Ralph Nader of the Internet” and one of 
          <em>Politico Magazine</em>'s top "thinkers, doers and visionaries transforming American politics," Dr. Christopher Soghoian is “the most prominent of a new breed of activist technology researchers” (
          <em>The Economist</em>), “who have risen to prominence by showing how tedious technical flaws can affect ordinary people.”
          <br>
          <br>Driven by the knowledge of how cyber security flaws can be exploited by governments and criminals, Soghoian has a history of taking exceptional measures to expose surveillance programs and advocate for the adoption of technical solutions that can protect us all.
          <br>
          <br>In just the past few years, Soghoian has exposed existence and use of “StingRays”, a military-grade surveillance technology now used by the FBI and police across America to track cell phones. He has revealed the existence of a dedicated hacking unit within the FBI capable of remotely activating webcams and microphones in computers and mobile phones. He also revealed how the FBI had impersonated the Associated Press in an effort to hack into one target’s computer.
          <br>
          <br>Soghoian’s research and activism has forced government agencies and corporations to improve their cybersecurity practices, as well as spurring several important national debates around privacy, cybersecurity and surveillance related issues. Indeed, citing Soghoian’s research on government surveillance of cell phones, 9th Circuit Chief Judge Alex Kozinski observed that “1984 may have come a bit later than predicted, but it’s here at last.”
          <br>
          <br>Soghoian is the Principal Technologist with the Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union, and is also a Visiting Fellow at Yale Law School's Information Society Project. He was previously the first in-house technical advisor to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission's Division of Privacy and Identity Protection.
          <br>
          <br>Soghoian is a TED Senior Fellow, and was previously an Open Society Foundations Fellow and a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society at Harvard University. He has been recognized as a “Tech Titan” by 
          <em>Washingtonian Magazine</em>, a top innovator under 35 by the 
          <em>MIT Technology Review</em>, and an “Engineering Hero” by 
          <em>IEEE Spectrum</em>. He holds a Ph.D. in Informatics from Indiana University and a M.S. in Security Informatics from The Johns Hopkins University.

Smith, Jr. founded Cyber Insights following 33 + years of service in the United States Army. He serves on the Advisory Board to the Army Cyber Institute (at West Point). BG (Ret) Smith has recently been named Dean of Faculty/Deputy Superintendent for Academics at Virginia Military Institute. 
          <br>
          <br>BG Smith’s last active duty assignment was as Deputy Commanding General (for Proponency), Army Cyber Command. BG Smith conceived LandCyber as the Army’s vision for a transformed Land Force with unprecedented range, interaction, situational understanding, agility, and influence. He served as the Army’s lead for the “LandCyber White Paper,” the Army's future concept for cyber-related transformation across the fields of Signal, Intelligence, Information Operations, Computer Network Operations, Electronic Warfare, and Knowledge. 
          <br>
          <br>Previously, BG Smith served as Commanding General, 5th Signal Command, United States Army Europe, as the Deputy Commanding General, Network and Technology Command, and as Deputy Commander of the Signal School/ TRADOC Program Integrator for Networks. As CG, 5th Signal Command, BG Smith led the Army’s effort to transform to the Joint Information Environment, a global DoD unified network construct that would support multiple Theaters of Operations (EUCOM and AFRICA Command). As DCG, NETCOM, BG Smith drafted the organizational constructs for 7th Signal Command to operate and defend Army networks in the Continental US. At the United States Army Signal Center, BG Smith was TRADOC’s lead for LandWarNet, the Army’s first Enterprise-wide strategic blueprint for Information Technology transformation across the Army branches. 
          <br>
          <br>BG Jeff Smith has had extensive operational experience. As the Army’s Senior Communicator in Afghanistan, BG Smith set the IT conditions required to support the "Presidential Surge,” create an interoperable shared data coalition network, and extend mobile IP capabilities to the Soldier on patrol. As commander of 22nd Signal Brigade and V Corps G6, BG Smith planned, operated, and defended the Information Technology Environment for the invasion and occupation of Iraq. As the first Coalition Joint Task Force C6, BG Smith planned the conversion of proprietary tactical networks into a common commercial, IP-based data infrastructure. BG Smith authored the “V Corps White Paper, Battle Command Concept,” from which today’s Army tactical network infrastructure is derived.
