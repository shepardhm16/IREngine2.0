This school was incredible! It was amazing to see how much young men and women can learn in a centered, loving environment.

         <td class="noBorder"> <h3 class="noAlign"> M.I.T. and Consulting </h3> <p>At the <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> I began as a teaching assistant for Steve Burns, whose ability to fabricate low-cost biomedical equipment for third-world countries sparked my interest in bioengineering. I became a research assistant for <a href="http://web.mit.edu/hst-program/erelab/">Elazer Edelman</a> and developed mathematical models and instrumentation to discover how endovascular stents expand. Stents are essentially pencil-lead thick hollow slotted tubes that are threaded inside atherosclerotic arteries. Most are then expanded by a small balloon (although some self-expand) and remain permanently inside the artery to scaffold it open. They have revolutionized cardiac health care; although approved by the FDA for only a decade they already account for nearly a million procedures per year in the US alone. Unfortunately, their very popularity has brought many legal suits in an effort to monopolize the stent manufacturing business, and towards the end of my doctorate I worked as an engineering consultant for legal firms to prevent this from occurring.</p> </td>

Like the service academies, academics are the primary goal and cadets are taught in a military environment that fosters teamwork, confidence, and personal responsibility. Unlike the service academies, nearly all the faculty hold doctorates and average more than ten yearâ€™s teaching experience. I teach Introduction to Electrical Engineering, Circuits II, Signals and Systems, Digital Signal Processing, a hybrid seminar/industry elective, and also advise many independent study projects including the ones shown <a href="../research/Student_Pages/student_pages.htm">here</a> in pages created by cadets.</p> </td>

We have two boys, <a href="../family/kevin/kevin.htm">Kevin</a> and <a href="../family/ryan/ryan.htm">Ryan</a>, who are involved in more activities than I can possibly list. My sons and I earned black belts from the <a href="http://afklexington.com/"> American Freestyle Karate Lexington studio</a>; <a href="./karate/karate.htm">here</a> are some of the katas for those affiliated with the studio. We also have Suzi, a Lab-ish stray that found us through Wade Bell when she was about 4 months old, and Pattie the Pug who showed up on our driveway one morning and never left. We are members of <a href="http://stpatrickslexington.com/"> St. Patrick Church</a> in Lexington. For fun I invent things with my kids that occasionally don't explode, co-manage several startups like <a href="http://www.getmatts.com/">this</a>, and play keyboards in the classic rock <a href="http://facebook.com/thecoproliteband">The Coprolite Band</a>. </p> </td>
