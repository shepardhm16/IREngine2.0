          <strong>Air Quality and Regulation </strong>
          <em>*Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section*</em>&nbsp;
          <p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;<em>TBD</em></p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Virginia Air Quality: Trends, Exposure, and Respiratory Health Impacts</strong></p>
          <p><em>James Blando, Ph.D., Old Dominion University</em></p>
          <p>Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life.&nbsp; A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia.&nbsp; The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories, emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants, ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants, ozone standard violations and associated meteorology, and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia.&nbsp; Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics.&nbsp; Data was gathered from many open reputable on-line sources available through various state and federal agencies.&nbsp; Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards.&nbsp; Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia, as it does for many other states.&nbsp; Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy, improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV’s and light trucks, reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities, utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles, utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations, and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia.&nbsp; This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Ozone Standard: What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans</strong></p>
          <p><em>Megan H. Berge, J.D., Partner, Baker Botts, LLP</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
          <p>National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act.&nbsp; Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised, and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards, their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing. This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards, with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants.&nbsp;</p>
          <p><u>Session 2:</u>&nbsp;<strong>Climate Regulation: Paris, Obama’s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan </strong><em>*Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section*</em></p>
          <p><strong>Moderator:</strong>&nbsp;<em>C. Flint Webb, Project Manager, Leidos, Engineering &amp; Technology Solutions Division</em></p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Overview of the Climate Action Plan, Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan &amp; Status of Legal Challenges</strong></p>
          <p><em>Will Cleveland, Staff Attorney, Southern Environmental Law Center</em></p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Virginia’s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan</strong></p>
          <p><em>Dawone Robinson, Virginia Policy Director, Chesapeake Climate Action Network</em></p>
          <p>The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U.S. power sector. The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change. The panel will provide information regarding Virginia's possible paths to compliance, as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers, industry, and the environment in the Commonwealth.</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand</strong></p>
          <p><em>Francis Hodsoll, SolUnesco</em></p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities</strong></p>
          <p><em>Christine Ng, Ph.D., Ramboll Environ</em></p>
          <p>Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing (or “fracing”) has rapidly expanded in the U.S. since the 1980s.&nbsp; While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, the Barnett Shale in Texas, the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana, and the Wattenberg field in Colorado, hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s.&nbsp; The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane, a greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks.&nbsp; USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1.5% of total production.&nbsp; Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology, emission controls, and monitoring.&nbsp; Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as “green completions” and optical gas imaging techniques, which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government.&nbsp; This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia.<strong><u></u></strong></p>
          <p><u>Session 3:</u>&nbsp;<strong>Air Permits: Developments, Trends and Best Practices </strong><em>*Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section*</em></p>

          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Overview of Recent Developments: NAAQS, Citizen Challenges, Aggregation</strong></p>
          <p><em>Daniel B. Schulson, J.D., Beveridge &amp; Diamond, P.C.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
          <p>The panelist will discuss recent developments that have air permitting implications, including those relating to GHGs, and EPA’s regulatory actions relating to startup, shutdown and malfunction (SSM SIP call).&nbsp; In addition, the panelist will discuss notable recent court decisions, such as those affecting source aggregation and statute of limitations issues, and how they affect permitting both at the federal and state levels.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Air Permitting – A State Perspective</strong></p>
          <p><em>Tamera Thompson, Manager, Office of Air Permit Programs, Virginia DEQ</em></p>
          <p>VA DEQ’s perspective on some of the current air permitting issues. Topics covered will include the incorporation of start-up and shutdown requirements in permits as a result of recent EPA lawsuits and EPA’s SSM SIP Call, greenhouse gas (GHG) permitting, and trends with Title V fees.</p>

          <p>Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay, including the mainstream and tributaries, will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll-a, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients.&nbsp; These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time, especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed.&nbsp; We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces.</p>

          <p><em>Dr. Paul A. Bukaveckas, Virginia Commonwealth University, Department of Biology, Center for Environmental Studies</em></p>
          <p>Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained.&nbsp; Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference-based (i.e., attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor, or in a least-impaired state), and effects-based (mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor).&nbsp; The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes.&nbsp; We tested these criteria using an effects-based approach to assess their protectiveness.&nbsp; The effects-based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference-based criteria, and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders.&nbsp; The use of an effects-based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses.&nbsp; These included water quality conditions (pH, dissolved oxygen, water clarity), phytoplankton community attributes (diversity, evenness, multimetric indices) and occurrence of harmful algae.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

          <p><em>Joe Wood, Virginia Staff Scientist, Chesapeake Bay Foundation</em></p>
          <p>As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces, the James River Estuary has become a very degraded, eutrophic system.&nbsp; This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen (DO) due to algal blooms, which have been well documented.&nbsp; However, this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution.&nbsp; The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife.&nbsp; Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity, toxic pH levels, and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary.&nbsp; </p>

          <p>The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program (VCAP) is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil &amp; Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia’s Watershed Implementation Plan. VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices. A plan is first proposed to the District, after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility, and with approval installation can begin. These practices can be installed in small acreage settings, at the source of stormwater discharges. All non-agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply – residential, business, public, and private. The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program (VCAP), created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee, began the pilot program to address WIP needs. The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed.<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><em>Jesse McWilliams, James Madison University</em></p>
          <p>The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County, Virginia. The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates. These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems. Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income. Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies. Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay. Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff. Due to Northumberland County’s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay, it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters. Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small-scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting. The adoption of a sustainable, cost-effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County. A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay.</p>

          <p><em>Mark Bryer, Chesapeake Bay Program Director, The Nature Conservancy</em></p>
          <p>The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality.&nbsp; A recently completed study, led by the Virginia Department of Forestry, examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay’s Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL).&nbsp; The results were stark: nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over $120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place.&nbsp; A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies, practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland.&nbsp; It will also build a "Commonwealth to Commonwealth" peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed.&nbsp; Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways.</p>

          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia’s Runoff Reduction Method</strong></p>
          <p><em>Clayton Hodges, PE, Virginia Tech</em></p>
          <p>Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method (VRRM), which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks (treatment trains).&nbsp; Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers, complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub-optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice (BMP) treatment combinations for individual sites.&nbsp; Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria.&nbsp; Virginia Tech, with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection.&nbsp; Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data (drainage areas, site constraints, etc.) and user rankings of selection criterion (aesthetics, cost, etc.) to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site.&nbsp; Output is ranked according to ‘strength’ of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user-defined selection criteria.</p>

          <p>This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command, Mid-Atlantic, cost-effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit.&nbsp; The first tool, which is GIS based, will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits, as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data (Virginia Department of Environmental Quality). The second tool, a database developed using Microsoft® Access, provides the NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs.&nbsp; Baker is currently developing a third tool, which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid-Atlantic’s Regional MS4 permit. The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system.&nbsp; A cost estimate report will be created based on common material, labor, and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed.&nbsp; The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs.</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits</strong></p>
          <p><em>Joe Lerch, Director of Environmental Policy, Virginia Municipal League</em></p>
          <p>Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars. This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants. Absent significant federal assistance, Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and/or debt capacity to implement these retrofits. This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits.<strong><em><u></u></em></strong></p>

          <p>EPA will be developing expectations for jurisdictions’ development of Phase III Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs) in 2017-2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025. Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners. The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development, evaluation, implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025. This assessment is based on conversations with 122 individuals from federal, state, and local government, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations. Because of the interest in learning what helped and what hindered local implementation, a substantial proportion of the conversations occurred with those directly involved with local efforts.</p>

          <p><em>Joan Salvati, Manager, Local Government Assistance Programs, Water Division, Virginia DEQ</em></p>
          <p>As the jurisdictions within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed begin the planning process for the development of Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) III, a significant challenge will be to engage local elected officials, local staff and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and enlist their input on identifying pollutant reducing strategies to be used in the Phase III WIP.&nbsp; Virginian is in the process of finalizing a work plan that will lay out a locality outreach approach that includes three phases of the WIP III planning process: education on process and expectations; strategy development; and WIP Drafting.&nbsp; This approach has been based on EPA’s Action Plan for Increased Local Partner Engagement and the Chesapeake Bay Program’s Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment. The outreach approach also builds on DEQ’s experience working with local governments on the Phase II WIP and the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and Stormwater program outreach initiatives.</p>

          <p>The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), which is a 330 mile 42” diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia, poses to be critically destructive of over 100,000 acres of environmental resources.&nbsp; These include, but are not limited to, endangered and threatened aquatic, faunal, and floral species through deforestation, forest fragmentation, stream sedimentation, and subterranean water pollution, as well as noise, air, and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage. Virginia’s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources. This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups, working with regional and national environmental organizations, to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP.&nbsp; The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three-pronged approach that involves integrated scientific; federal, state, and local political interventions; and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local, regional, national, and international levels.&nbsp; This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia.</p>

          <p><em>Erika Murray, James Madison University </em></p>
          <p>Solar photovoltaics have been a viable electricity generation option for decades, yet have not gained the market penetration needed to make significant impacts on an entrenched energy system. The aim of this thesis project is to provide and present a cartographic representation of current photovoltaic market penetration into residential electricity markets for use by small solar companies looking for geographic market trends. Utilizing a time-lapsed version of this tool, a spatial and temporal analysis was conducted in order to identify the events which catalyzed the consumer’s decision to install, including but not limited to community co-op initiatives and government incentives. Furthermore, all available residential solar customers were surveyed in order to concretely ascertain their motives for adoption and acquire consolidated feedback on the effectiveness of initiatives and incentives. With concerns of global climate change, national energy security, and local air quality at the forefront of the public’s mind, solar photovoltaic market penetration provides a comprehensive avenue towards a more sustainable Virginia.<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><em>Trenton Clark, Director of Engineering, Virginia Asphalt Association</em></p>
          <p>Each year, Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct, reconstruct, rehabilitate and maintain pavements.&nbsp; To manufacture asphalt concrete, aggregates and asphalt binder are needed.&nbsp; Initially, asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries.&nbsp; However, over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials.&nbsp; Today, technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100% recycled.&nbsp; These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly, but are economical and well-performing.&nbsp; In addition to 100% recycled materials, new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff.&nbsp; Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures, owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space.&nbsp; This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management. <strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><em>Morgan Goodman, Environmental Specialist, Virginia DEQ</em></p>
          <p>Business operations in Virginia can have significant environmental impacts, but how can they go beyond regulatory compliance and why would they choose to?&nbsp; DEQ’s Office of Pollution Prevention (P2) has a unique perspective on what it takes to be a success story and the benefits of doing so. P2 staff has seen firsthand how many approaches there are to implementing environmental programs and what underlying factors are indicators of success. Incorporating information from the Virginia Environmental Excellence Program (VEEP), Governor’s Environmental Excellence Awards, and P2 Case Studies, key program factors for strengthening environmental management were identified. When a strong environmental program is in place, businesses can manage environmental risks, reduce costs, participate in voluntary programs, and engage stakeholders. Staff, community members, and regulators recognize businesses that are motivated to go beyond regulatory compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

          <p><em>Christopher Mueller, Project Manager, Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division</em></p>
          <p>Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development (LID)-based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County, VA. To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities, they need to be adequately designed, built, inspected, and maintained. The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality, performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life. In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District, the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services, Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division, used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly-maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County. All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria, permitted by the county, and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions. As part of the study, existing structural specifications such as ponding depth, facility footprint, soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties, among others, were evaluated. An inventory of the existing plants, comparison with the original planting plan, and the dominant invasive and volunteer plants was prepared. Lack of construction compliance with the original design was one of the main findings of this study. The study makes recommendations on how to improve construction oversight and compliance with the original design at the time of construction.</p>

          <p>Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) offers a quality and convenient educational experience at an affordable price. Four of the NOVA campuses (Alexandria, Annandale, Loudoun and Woodbridge) have a Phase II General Permit for the Discharge of Stormwater from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems (MS4). NOVA implements an MS4 Program Plan that includes best management practices (BMPs) to address six minimum control measures (MCMs) and special conditions for the Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) where NOVA has been assigned a wasteload allocation (WLA), including the Chesapeake Bay TMDL. The Chesapeake Bay TMDL and the Virginia Phase I Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP) requires "that all state agencies, state colleges and universities, ? that own land upon which fertilizer, manure, sewage sludge or other compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus are applied to support agricultural, turf, plant growth, or other uses shall develop and implement a nutrient management plan (NMP) for such land." DEQ issued a new MS4 General Permit on July 1, 2013 that requires MS4 operators to develop NMPs where nutrients are applied to a contiguous area greater than one acre. NOVA recently updated their NMP's for each campus based on the Virginia DCR Virginia Nutrient Management Standards and Criteria (Revised July 2014. Based on the soil test results, current turf conditions, the intensity of use, and overall visibility and aesthetic considerations, Nutrient Management Areas (NMA) at each campus were established. The number of nutrient management areas was kept to a minimum to facilitate effective management and still protect water quality and maintain healthy turf. The NMPs included detailed maps and recommendations for the NMAs at each campus including a general description of the condition of each area, the size of the area, annual nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) fertilization recommendations, and general liming considerations. Like most public facilities the campuses have turf areas where there is ineffective groundcover, including turfgrass. Areas where there is ineffective groundcover have been temporarily removed from active nutrient management until such time as corrective measures can be completed to either establish suitable turf or implement other landscape solutions (groundcovers, hardscape, etc.).<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p>Problem: Increasing need to monitor environmental factors or significant aspects (ISO14001:2015) (wetlands, pipelines, smokestacks, utilities, property security) as well as associated risk including emergency service response (fire, police, medical) present opportunities to reduce the cost of monitoring, and increase capabilities to manage environmental resources. The purpose of this session is to share information with participants regarding UAV capabilities, the regulatory environment, and discuss the future of UAVs. Videos will be utilized to demonstrate examples of UAV applications. NOTE: An associated session is proposed for flight demonstration at a separate time and location. Scope of Work Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) provides significant opportunities to monitor environmental resources, assets and reduce risk. The current regulatory environment has caused confusion within the UAV (air) and UV (unmanned vehicle - air, water, land) communities. This session will inform participants of the current state of UAV operations and management; distinguish operations (Operational Sectors) associated with high level predatory type vehicles (military focus), the hobbyist, and focus on applications for units of government, business and industry. Geographic Orientation The focus of the presentation will be on opportunities in Virginia. Problem Solving Approach Information regarding UAV (aka Drones) is not consistent across Operational Sectors with much of the media focus on military operations and the unfortunate hobbyist miscalculations. Two respected experts in Virginia will present information based on their knowledge and skills associated with regulations, research and operations. Results As a result of the differential coverage and understanding of UAV (Drones) capabilities, attendees will have a greater understanding of the beneficial use of UAV's for the environment (and rules, perceptions) for government, business and industrial focused applications. Implication of Results Many business, industry and units of government want to pursue use of UAV technology but are unsure of operational environment, rules and liability. Emergency response personnel may find great advantage using UAVs. This session will allow participants to evaluate and develop a path forward.<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p>In 2009, the GW Office of Sustainability published the GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy based on input from internal and external stakeholders to integrate sustainability into academics, research, practice, and outreach.&nbsp; The Strategy addresses the university’s impact and dependence on resource systems on campus, in the Chesapeake Bay eco-region, and globally.&nbsp; It provides a framework for specific action plans such as a zero waste plan, climate action plan, and water plan. </p>
          <p>Currently a cross-functional team of faculty, staff, and students are working on Sustainable Landscapes Guidelines. This document will encourage campus planning that addresses the six goals of the Strategy.&nbsp; The Guidelines provide an analysis of the physical condition of the campus landscape as well as social and behavioral aspects of the use of outdoor space by students, faculty, staff and neighbors. The Guidelines build a regenerative design approach for the campus landscape.</p>
          <p>GW’s Square 80 Plaza is a Sustainable Sites Initiative (SITES®) certified pilot project. The SITES program for sustainable landscape development, administered by the Green Business Certification, Inc. (GBCI), provides tools, guidelines and performance benchmarks for ecologically resilient landscapes that measure performance in the economic, environmental, and social dimensions of sustainability. Square 80 Plaza is a powerful example of sustainable design; it advances the goals of GW’s Ecosystem Enhancement Strategy in measurable ways while providing much-needed green open space in a highly urban context.<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><em>Richard Brown, P.E., Senior Technical Consultant, Joyce Engineering, Inc.</em></p>
          <p>Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14-acre unlined landfill. The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for $2.1M. The County decided to invest an additional $300,000 (14%) for an innovative, first in Virginia, structured geomembrane/artificial turf (SGAT) cap system which has several long-term economic advantages. First, the SGAT system allows an addition 2.0 ft of waste (45,000 cy) to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18-inch infiltration and 6-inch vegetative support layers at a value of $1.5M. Second, the Owner will save about $100,000/year on maintenance because there will be no mowing, slope erosion repair, or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope. Third, since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50-mil LLDPE geomembrane, there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining. The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage. The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side. Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast. Diversion berms, downslope drainage channels, and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand/cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater. Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre. The end result is an aesthetically pleasing, uniformly green, maintenance-free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years.</p>

          <p>PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment.&nbsp; Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb, PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate.&nbsp; Hence, risk-based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low.&nbsp; Specifically,&nbsp; water quality criteria can be&nbsp; close to method detection limits - in units of picograms per liter, which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water.&nbsp; These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively. We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility.&nbsp; The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model (CSM) that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways. An effective CSM aids in cost-benefit analysis of targeted best management practices (BMPs) which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost. Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized.&nbsp; As projects are completed, monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment.&nbsp; <strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><em>Jillian Leary, James Madison University</em></p>
          <p><em>Maryam Ekbatani, James Madison University</em></p>
          <p>Electronic waste (e-waste) is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world (Widmer, 2007; Hester et al., 2008). This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter. To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device, manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste. In 2007, it was found that approximately 80% of e-waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill; despite the presence of a landfill’s protective lining, contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas (Wong, 2007). As a result of this, heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, nickel, plutonium, arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) make their way into the soil (Reddy et al., 2004). The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies, as well as cause infertility in soil. This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water (Liulin et al., 2011).</p>
          <p>The presences of heavy metals in soil, specifically copper, nickel, and lead, can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility’s and solubility’s. The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead, Copper, and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology. </p>
          <p>The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead, copper, and nickel in sand and peat soils. A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

          <p><em>Michael Stegeman, Franchise Development, Securis</em></p>
          <p>An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices. In Virginia homes alone, there are 70 million computers, phones, printers, and more - weighing 541,190,000 million pounds. When considering that this number doesn't include electronics used for businesses and government, the amount of equipment out there is staggering, and increasing each year. The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e-waste annually, but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled. At the rate that technology is evolving, the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow. What happens to these devices once they're retired? Realizing this growing need, Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies, government agencies, and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100% guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills. Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics, Navy Federal Credit Union, Raytheon, and the Federal Reserve. In 2013, Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey, including two in Virginia. Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location. This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States. We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents, businesses, and local municipalities choosing a certified, responsible recycler. We'll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler. We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets.<strong><em><u></u></em></strong></p>

The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were: (1) identify and remove the source, and (2) understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating “clean” groundwater.&nbsp; A multi-tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal, recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering, and in situ injections of&nbsp; zero-valent iron and/or electron donor (carbon) sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry.&nbsp; The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals.</p>

          <p><em>William Lassetter, Economic Geology Section Manager, Virginia DMME</em></p>
          <p>The Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions. These conditions may include extended drought, contamination of normal drinking water supplies, the need for hazardous dust control, fire suppression, and other urban water system needs. With steep walls, limited inflow from surface drainages, and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation, deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall. These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water. The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use. A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters, water balance and storage capacity characteristics, and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water-filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia. The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state-wide inventory of water-filled mines and quarries. Prepared as a web-based map service, this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders.</p>

          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation</strong></p>
          <p><em>Britt McMillan, Principal Geologist, Arcadis</em></p>
          <p>2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia, with the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation. Redefining the 80% drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia. The impetus for these changes was the long-standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain: if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights, there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource. Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model, DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions. However, as will be demonstrated, the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use. A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal. The original 80% drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown, requiring 20% remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering. While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80% criterion, it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric. This results in creation of "critical areas" that never met and can never meet the criterion. The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation. While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy, the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow (HUF) approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over-predict drawdown by over 35-feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers, where less than one-foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal. Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource.</p>

          <p><em>Craig Nicol, Program Manager, Virginia DEQ</em></p>
          <p>For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain, all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues.&nbsp; Resource issues present challenges, but with a shift in perspective, they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome. With greater collaboration, flexibility, and creativity, we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia.</p>
          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Managing Coastal Plain GW: An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use</strong></p>
          <p><em>Curt Thomas, Program Coordinator, Virginia DEQ</em></p>
          <p>Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain. While DEQ monitors permitted water use, a large portion of unregulated water use (mainly private residential wells) remained unknown. Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector. Thus, DEQ, VDH, and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data. DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives: (1) created a joint, GW-2/Unified Water Well Completion Report and (2) developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies. The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation, improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals, and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia’s water resources.<strong><u></u></strong></p>

          <p><em>Ram Gupta, Ph.D., Virginia DEQ</em></p>
          <p>Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices (BMPs) on water quality status. Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters&nbsp; across the Commonwealth. Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates. The Carter Run watershed, located in Fauquier County, Virginia, is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The watershed (approximately 35,580 acres) is comprised of forest (63%), agricultural (35%), and residential (2%) land uses. A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia’s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State’s water quality standards for fecal coliform. A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for Carter Run was completed in 2005. An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies, led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed. </p>
          <p>BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015. These BMPs include: (i) agricultural practices - 290,326 linear feet (55 miles) of livestock stream exclusion fencing, 198 acres of riparian buffer, 93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland, and (ii) residential practices - 95 septic tank system pump-outs, 28 septic system repairs, and seven septic system installations or replacements. These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria, nitrogen, phosphorous and sediment loadings. The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long-term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E. coli single sample maximum criterion.&nbsp;&nbsp; The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning, commitment of long-term funding, and a partnership between government agencies, local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

          <p>Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia, and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock.&nbsp; The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground-water recharge into karst aquifers.&nbsp; Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals, and Energy, supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type, bedding orientation and thickness, and position relative to fault traces, fold axial traces, and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits.&nbsp; Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes.&nbsp;&nbsp; The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes.&nbsp; Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships.&nbsp; An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing, and preliminary results will be presented.</p>

          <p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>A New Wetlands Water Budget Model</strong></p>
          <p><em>Michael Rolband, President, Wetland Studies and Solutions, Inc. </em></p>
          <p>Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues. An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate. Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices. The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the "Pierce Method". While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects, areas of improvement have been noted. Specifically, it cannot model all sloped wetlands, it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths, the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption, other soil characteristics are not accounted for, groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree, with a Type II rainfall distribution, the volume of run off may be overestimated, and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs, which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites. The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows-based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual. Called WetBud, this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as "dry", "typical", and "wet", modeling of sloped wetlands, modeling of groundwater inflows, the ability to account for existing ditching and/or the filling of ditching, the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics, ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems, an input/output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans. The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and/or restored.</p>

          <p><em>David Jurgens, City of Chesapeake</em>The residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD) each day. HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways. The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals. HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces. To that end, HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality, then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia. Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate, jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer. HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia. The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer, increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone, as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border. The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence. The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use, with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area. The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer. Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world, and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia’s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility. Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD’s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake’s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer.</p>

          <p><span>Accordingto the U.S. EPA, stormwater pollution from urban and suburban landscapesaccounts for 15 percent of the nitrogen pollution flowing into the ChesapeakeBay, and it is the only source of pollution in the watershed that is stillincreasing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Costs for treatingstormwater to meet local and regional total maximum daily load or permitrequirements is high and these investments compete with other high prioritycommunity needs, like economic development , public health, and education.<span>&nbsp; </span>This panel will focus on strategies forimplementing urban stormwater pollution prevention projects that provide directbenefits to the communities in which they are located. Panelists fromenvironmental, youth group, and funder organizations will provide examples ofprojects that are addressing these dual environmental and community goals andshare ideas for expanding this approach throughout the region.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

          <p><em><span>Alexander Macfarlane, JamesMadison University</span></em></p>
          <p><span>Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U.S. Department ofEnergy (DOE) because of their potential to provide clean, renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply. However, the DOE’s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable: large-scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting. This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel, energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod. This method was developed through a public-private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh, VA. This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non-polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase. The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process. Through this optimization of theharvesting system, we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in theglobal energy market.</span></p>
