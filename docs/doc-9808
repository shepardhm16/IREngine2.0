   <p> Timothy Graziano, '12, designed and built an embedded device that identified the sonic signature of a gunshot using digital signal processing techniques. It also identified the audible strength of the sound on a 7 segment LED. The intent was to synthesize a network of three of these to provide a wearable device that could immediately triangule the position of sniper fire in an urban battlefield situation. Although another research team made it to production before we did, Tim did earn second place in the VMI Undergraduate Reseach Symposium in engineering for the device, and also presented at BigSURS 2010 at Radford College. </p>
