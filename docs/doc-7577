In the north, Boka Haram commits daily violence to impose its extreme form of Islam on the region. Elections Feb. 14 will determine the nation’s leader: incumbent Goodluck Jonathan, who has been unable to meet these challenges, or former military dictator Muhammadu Buhari. </p>

          <p><em>So why is perhaps the biggest challenger in a democratic election [Muhammadu Buhari] a former dictator? Why is Goodluck Jonathan perhaps favored to win in spite of all the violence? </em><br><br><iframe height="141" align="right" width="250" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117627743?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe><a target="_blank" title="View/download video of this section" href="http://vimeo.com/album/3226047/video/117625616" class="btn btn-primary">View/download video of this section </a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" title="&nbsp;View/download transcript of this section" href="/Content.aspx?id=10737431657">View/download transcript of this section</a></p>
          <p><strong>Hentz:</strong> The reason why it may appear that Goodluck Jonathan has an early advantage would be that he has control over the patronage resources; he has control to some extent over the media and outflow of information, so he’ll use his considerable resources to make it appear as if he’s the likely winner. I probably would not bet on that being the actual fact.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> On the contrary, many would argue that unless the ruling government does something underhanded he stands very little chance of winning the election. … What many people don’t realize is that sometimes the general Nigerian public yearns for military intervention in the face of just reckless corruption with impunity as is happening just right now. Security is usually a very important issue for any country, and there has been insecurity for years. … The impression therefore is that being a strong military leader, perhaps that’s the kind of person that will be needed at this particular point in time to tackle the insurgency.<br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> We in the West tend to think they [you] can telescope political development and think that you can get everything at once. … He [Buhari] may have been a dictator, but if he’s elected, he’s no longer a dictator he’s an elected president first of all, and second of all the notion that he is a military man may resonate throughout the country and give them the stability that they need.<br><br><iframe height="141" width="250" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117627510?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe>&nbsp;</p>

         <div class="more">
          <p><em>Southern Nigeria, which is primarily responsible for Nigeria’s status as Africa’s biggest producer of oil, is far from the center of violence, Nigeria’s Muslim north, and Boko Haram, whose leader … has referenced the “glory days of northern Nigeria’s medieval Muslim empires” (Julia Payne, Reuters, Nigerians face killings, hunger in Boko Haram's 'state,' Jan. 19, 2015). He seems to be at war with Nigeria’s Muslim center. … Who’s fighting who and where does this come from?</em><br><br><iframe height="281" width="500" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117627741?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe> &nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Hentz:</strong> The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram. So why? … The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they’re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative. … So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously, both … both in peripheral areas far from the center … and in Nigerian politics, the periphery, whether it’s the south or the north, have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake. <br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta. The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control; they’ve been ignored for so long. … And it’s an environmental disaster. And because of the complacency of the central government, … efforts to clean up … have not been adequate, leaving the people, some of whom are fishermen, unable to engage in very fulfilling day-to-day sustenance. <br><br>Because Boko Haram’s intentions are to Islamize the whole country, including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south. And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north, guess what their next target is going to be? So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries. <br><br>In the early days of Boko Haram, when they emerged in 2002, they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban. … that’s why other Muslims are not safe, if they’re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or as colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values.<br>&nbsp;<br><iframe height="281" width="500" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117629401?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> Within Nigeria, some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta, although it provides 98 percent of the state’s revenues. But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time. While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency, … there’s now side by side … with that a warlord conflict, what we call a war economy. And so there are insurgency groups – and there’s an alphabet soup list of them – who actually make money off the conflict through, in particular, bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong>What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian-Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude, who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power. So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves. They are using that tool to get an advantage.<br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong>And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad, into Cameroon, into Niger, as it is, you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons. … It’s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders. … These transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks. These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it’s almost impossible to untangle them.<br><br>People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons. James, it’s not just religious. It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms, I’m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return. … They’re just adapting what they want to do, their trading networks, their conflicts, to age-old Trans-Sahel trading routes and alliances. And it’s a very fluid situation.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong> In fact some people have used foreign fighters … for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria. … They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of. <br>&nbsp;<br><iframe height="281" width="500" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117629845?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> What we’re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict, not a Nigerian conflict. And recently the United States is … celebrating … that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram. So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface. The Chadian Army, though, is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims, … which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active. <br><br>We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here. <br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> In fact, in some ways you can draw parallels with what’s going on with ISIL in Syria. Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth. Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it. So at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites. Guess what. It has now morphed out of control. And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened. <br><br><iframe height="281" width="500" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117627744?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe></p>

          <p><strong>Hentz:</strong> My trip to Niger was to what they call ‘train the trainers.” … Just days after I left Niger they had riots … as a response to what France was doing and the cartoons and burnt down some churches and set some hotels on fire. I haven’t found out if my hotel was set on fire. I don’t know if I want to know if my hotel was set on fire. <br><br>But Niger is a strong American ally right now. … But the same substratum exists there as in northern Nigeria: These young men that are easily recruited into these sort of extremist movements because their lives just flat out are not very good and they see this as an option, maybe the only option. It’s remarkable how I’m there working as a representative of the United States government helping to promote U.S.-Nigerien relations and cooperation specifically in the fight against Islamic terrorism in the Trans-Sahel and four days later there’s riots in the capital because of their reaction to the political cartoons depicting the prophet in France.<br><br>So it’s a tinderbox. This part of the world is a tinderbox.</p>

          <p><strong>Gire: </strong> You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is, I would imagine, one of the most optimistic persons out there. They have ambitions for education, for raising families, for having their children as well as themselves be successful. <br><br>Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram, a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet, which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important. Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption, particularly in the central government, then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there.<br><br>The president, upon responding to aspects of corruption, will say something like this: … Everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria; when you build a very good house, you’re viewed as being corrupt, which is surprising because if you’re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50,000 naira a month, which is not that much, if you don’t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on, and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house, it has to be labeled as something. Where did you get the money from? <br><br>For the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition [that] has developed.<br><br>People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard-working people, some of the most resourceful people out there, that the government has been in the way. <br><br>To some extent … [corruption] has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on, but it’s a matter of magnitude. … What has happened right now, which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable, … an example will be somebody who holds office [and] has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract maybe for a bridge; 100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge. None. Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality. … And even for Nigerians, that is too much. <br><br>Which is why [Muhammadu] Buhari … is out there. Remember, a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians. Buhari’s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria. OK, Buhari, when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago, laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there. He said, “I was a military general and a head of state. I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me.” <br><br>People are just fed up. In other words, Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption, whereby $20 million have been allotted to build, say, a political science building at the university, you actually see it built, maybe it took $15 million to build it, people say, “OK, maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that.” To some extent that has been accepted. What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted.</p>

          <p><em>Is Boko Haram and maybe more broadly the Nigerian unrest, is that a threat to the West?</em><br><br><iframe height="281" width="500" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117630355?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe>&nbsp;</p>

          <p><strong>Hentz: </strong>I think we’re pretty well aware. ISIL’s got [the] front page. France grabbed the front page. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen’s up there, but I think you’re going to see over the next year that not just Boko Haram again but the whole Trans-Sahel area is going to be a high priority for U.S. national security.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong>The situation in France killed a few people; at that same time 2,000 people were killed in Nigeria. In fact even other African countries [that] sometimes refrain from criticizing Nigeria came down hard against Jonathan because he was one of the first leaders to send words of sympathy to France and had not mentioned a word about the 2,000 people that were killed in his own country. <br><br>The activities [of Boko Haram] are becoming not only more explosive but more sophisticated. The general belief now is that they have training links with Al Qaeda. So if we’re interested in Al Qaeda in Yemen, we ought to be interested in Boko Haram in Nigeria ... because eventually, there’s going to be that link. <br><br>The folks who carried out the attacks on France and so on were not foreigners, they were French citizens, who had influence there. They come back with the passports of their own countries. … And so it’s in everyone’s interest to recognize this for the serious problem that it is and ensure that it does not spread, because otherwise it will splinter into these little fragments that are very difficult to contain from a broad national attack perspective. You can’t take the U.S. Army against a few individuals who just returned from Syria, one of whom is in Kansas, one of whom is in Maine, another of whom is from a different part of the country. <br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong> All over the news right now is this notion that ISIL and AQAP [Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula] are going to start trying to outbid each other for the more outstanding terrorist event – you can call this the CNN effect on steroids, right? If you want to get on the news, you have to be the one who does the most spectacular event. <br><br>I don’t know why they don’t bring Boko Haram in here too. Shekau likes to be on TV. He likes publicity, and in fact, it’s kind of we’re back to James’s 2,000. It’s “look at me, I just killed 2,000 people and you’re not even looking at me.” I’m guessing … he’s going back saying, “Oh what do I have to do now, to get on TV, right?”<br><br>Not only do we have to take a regional approach, we have to take a holistic approach. We have to understand in a globalized world how events in France affect Niger, how events in Tunisia affect Libya, how events in Libya affect Nigeria, how events in Yemen affect Boko Haram. This is not just a regional challenge, this is a global challenge, from Minnesota to Paris to London to Nigeria.<br><br><br><iframe height="281" width="500" src="//player.vimeo.com/video/117630492?color=ffffff&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"></iframe></p>

          <p>Gire: The most important thing in the foreseeable future, which is in about three weeks, is the forthcoming election. It has the potential to change, I think, maybe things for the better. …A change at the center would be a signal that there’s a limit to how much you can ignore. And so whichever government that comes in will be cognizant that the other guys, we kicked them out because they didn’t do so good. So they’ll be more likely to at least try to address it even if for the selfish purpose of trying to retain power.</p>
