           <li>Exit at 188-B (60 West) and proceed a couple of miles to Lexington.</li> 
           <li>Turn right at the light on Main St/11N which is one-way north. Stay in the right hand lane.</li> 
           <li>After 2 blocks the right-lane turns right. It remains Route 11, but becomes 2-way.</li> 
           <li>Take a left at the first light, in about 100'. This puts you on a short road, Engineering Drive.</li> 
           <li>You will see a parking lot on your left, but a one-way sign will prevent you from entering it. Instead, follow it around, staying as left as possible, until you circle around and enter the parking lot on its other side.</li> 
           <li> After parking, walk uphill. You want to walk between the single row of buildings you see uphill. Depending on where you parked, there are numerous paths between the buildings.</li> 
           <li> You will now be on Letcher Avenue and will see a parade ground in front of you. Turn to the right and walk down Letcher until the parade ground almost ends. On your right you will see a statue on a tall round pedestal. Behind the statue is Nichols Engineering Hall. My office is one flight up from the main entrance, room 620.</li>

           <li> In one mile, just after crossing the Maury River Bridge, the road will split. Bear right to stay on Main Street.</li> 
           <li> In about a quarter mile you will come to a traffic light. Make a right onto Engineering Drive. </li>

           <li>Travel 4 miles (past the switchback and amazing view at 2.5 miles and through the intersection at 3 miles). Immediately after passing <q>Wild Bluebird Lane</q> and sign for <q>Marlbrook Acres</q> on left, the next driveway on left is ours. It has a green <q>1949</q> on the mailbox.</li>
