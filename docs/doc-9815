     <td class="cellHoldingMainTable"> <p class="noAlign withPadding" style="line-height:120%"> Students have produced an extraordinary variety of quality work in various independent research projects. Like any engineering project, much of the work lies in the documentation, and I require cadets to provide an oral presentation and submit a written project report and a web page for every project undertaken. The following pages show a sampling of the research work of some of the students I have advised. These are truly some of the finest men and women with whom I have had the pleasure of collaboration. &nbsp;</p>

The model has been improved from Generation II in many ways including improved velocity sensing, higher torque motors, response to being flipped over, anti-fouling axials, and computer-regulation of the base station. The student team won second place in the URS undergraduate research conference for engineering.&nbsp; After testing in in early June by the Old Dominion University team of Drs. Dan Sonenshine and Holly Gaff it was featured in a number of newspaper articles and television reports (click here and expand the Popular Media/Television section).</td>

This second generation robot was designed to be rugged enough to withstand independent laboratory testing for two weeks at Fordham University. The robot was demonstrated at the Virginia Academy of Science and the MARCUS undergraduate research conference at Sweet Briar. <br> <a href="./12 tick rover II/12 tick rover II.htm">link</a> </td>

The intent was to synthesize a network of three of these to provide a wearable device that could immediately triangule the position of sniper fire in an urban battlefield situation. Tim earned second place in the VMI Undergraduate Reseach Symposium in engineering for the device, and presented at BigSURS 2010 at Radford College. <br> <a href="./11 fire direction/08 fire direction.htm">link</a> </td>
