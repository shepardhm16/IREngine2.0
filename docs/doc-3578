Who’s fighting who and where does this come from?<br><br>Hentz: There is still conflict in the south, so let me go back to that first. The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram. So why? This doesn’t really answer your question, but I think it’s really important. The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press. The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they’re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative. So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to. When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up, it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got. Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta. The conflict in the Niger Delta, though, is still a serious conflict, and it’s still a serious problem. So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously, both – and this is from an academic perspective what I like to look at – both in peripheral areas far from the center, the center being Lagos and Abuja, and in Nigerian politics, the periphery, whether it’s the south or the north, have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake. There are a lot of drivers to this conflict – I’m sure between James and me we’ll come up with a whole bunch – certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources, and it is not equitable, and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it, a place at the table to eat.<br><br>Gire: It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta. The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control; they’ve been ignored for so long. They believe that in the areas are where the bulk of the oil was derived, and if you’ve seen oil spills here – what BP was made to go through and so on – there’ve been tons of spills across the oil-producing areas <br><br>Hentz: And gas flaring<br><br>Gire: and gas flares, and it’s an environmental disaster. And because of the complacency of the central government and so on, efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate, leaving the people, some of whom are fishermen, unable to engage in very fulfilling day-to-day sustenance. And so the violence was to bring attention and say, “Hey, we’re here, and you’ve got to take care of these issues that we’ve been raving about.” And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that.<br><br>With respect to Boko Haram in the north, it’s a little bit different. That is principally [a] religious kind of thing, and that’s why it’s scary, and that’s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention. Because Boko Haram’s intentions are to Islamize the whole country, including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south. And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north, guess what their next target is going to be? So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries. As Jim can testify, right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger, in Chad, in Cameroon – these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria, sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth.<br><br>They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors. They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee. In fact, in the early days of Boko Haram, when they emerged in 2002, they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban. And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country, so that’s why other Muslims are not safe, if they’re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values.<br><br>Hentz: The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons: it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear. You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer. Within Nigeria, some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta, although it provides 98 percent of the state’s revenues. But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time. While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency – meaning, “We want to reform the nature of the state” – there’s now side by side (maybe a better word would be integrated) with that a warlord conflict, what we call a war economy. And so there are insurgency groups – and there’s an alphabet soup list of them – who actually make money off the conflict through in particular bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines. Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors. They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians. So there’s many dimensions.<br><br>There’s another element to that conflict. The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden. The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam, but he was also saying that people with western education, which was mostly southerners, are dominating the government. And these southerners that dominate the government, which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated, or Western educated, so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam, it’s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government which means they weren’t getting the resources they believe they should have. <br><br>It’s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim, it’s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country.<br><br>Gire: Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria, so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country. At the same time, though, the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria, and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria, Ahmadu Bello, is believed to have delayed Nigeria’s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready, that if they had given independence at that time, the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners. So there’s a vestige of that. What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian-Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude, who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power. So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves. They are using that tool to get an advantage.<br><br>I think at the bottom of it all is to control of the powerful economic resources that are available.<br><br>Hentz: There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict, that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict, in other words it was more about power than it was about religion. And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad, into Cameroon, into Niger, as it is, you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons. So it may be that at the heart of this conflict – I’m talking about Boko Haram, it’s an Islamic conflict – it’s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders. And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya, these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks. These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it’s almost impossible to untangle them. People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons. James, it’s not just religious. It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms, I’m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return. We call this again a war economy. And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram, more so than the Niger Delta, which has been a remarkably self-contained conflict – it has not spread really (it’s in the Niger Delta; it’s spread a little bit in Nigeria: I’m talking about across borders.) Boko Haram has a different logic. The contagion effect there is much more severe. And I would argue because it’s following the 400-year-old trading routes in that part of the world. They’re not doing anything different than what’s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate. They’re just adapting what they want to do, their trading networks, their conflicts, to age-old Trans-Sahel trading routes and alliances. And it’s a very fluid situation.<br><br>Gire: In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria. You probably read this too, Jim. The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers.<br><br>Hentz: That’s another dimension of the conflict.<br><br>Gire: And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria.<br><br>They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this. Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of. It’s something that’s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests. But there’s also a broader, more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf, who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau, that’s much broader. In fact, the original founder, this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy, the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder, was born in 1927 or something. And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied. And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not [the] prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will. So it dates way back.<br><br>Hentz: To add to what James said, I think what we’re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict, not a Nigerian conflict. And recently the United States is sort of I don’t know if the word is celebrating, bragging, happy, that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram. So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface. The Chadian Army, though, is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims, so now you’re bringing in another group, of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to [Gen. Idriss] Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims, which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active. Again, from the U.S. foreign policy perspective – something that I look at – we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem. We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here. And it’s not just northeast Nigeria. It’s the Trans-Sahel, it’s Nigeria, it’s the south – it’s history. I mean, as James was talking about, you need to go all the way back to the 1920s to understand how this Boko Haram evolved.<br><br>Gire: That is a very apt analogy, Jim. In fact, in some ways you can draw parallels with what’s going on with ISIL in Syria. Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth. Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it. So in at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites. Guess what. It has now morphed out of control. And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened because this stuff has ballooned beyond what the initial expectations were. So this has the potential to be really a wide-scale problem if it’s not contained. <br><br><br><font size="2">Copyright © 2015 Virginia Military Institute. For academic and news media use only.
