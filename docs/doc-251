Cadets are encouraged to consult with the VMI ROTC detachments if they have questions, and are eligible to declare those ROTC designations upon approval from the appropriate unit.</p> <p>All cadets who are citizens of the United States and who qualify physically, mentally, and morally are encouraged to contract with an ROTC unit. The length of the active duty and reserve status period varies with the personnel needs of the Department of Defense. VMI can make no guarantee of enrollment or of continuance in the ROTC as these matters are controlled by the Federal government.</p> <h2><a name="Army"></a>Army</h2> <p>The mission of Army ROTC is to commission the future officer leadership of the U.S. Army and to motivate young people to be better citizens. Any cadet interested in developing leadership skills in a challenging environment will benefit from what Army ROTC has to offer. Those cadets who are committed to serving their county and who desire a career as a commissioned Army officer will find themselves well prepared by the top Army ROTC program in the nation. This four-year program is divided into a basic and an advanced course. The Basic Course, during a cadet’s first two years, consists of instruction in the basics of teamwork, leadership, and exciting hands-on skills. The Advanced Course, for cadets in their last two years, focuses on practical group leadership and advanced military skills. Army ROTC is centered on leadership development, with individual feedback and counseling provided to each cadet. Cadets will learn in both classroom and field environments, and Army ROTC offers a Field Training Exercise each semester, designed to enhance cadets’ confidence, teamwork, and leadership abilities. In addition, Army ROTC sponsors a number of extracurricular cadet clubs and activities, including the Cadet Battery, Ranger Company, and the Ranger Challenge competition. Cadets pursuing an Army commission are strongly encouraged to participate in these activities, but all are welcome.</p> <p>Qualified cadets are encouraged to contract with Army ROTC as a scholarship or non-scholarship cadet. Contracted cadets receive a monthly stipend of $300 during the freshman year, $350 as a sophomore, $450 as a junior, and $500 during the senior year. Contracting is the first step toward earning a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army.</p> <p>In addition to eight semesters of Army ROTC, cadets pursuing a commission must complete a professional military educational requirement of one semester of U.S. military history. They must also succeed during the five-week Leadership Development and Assessment Course (LDAC), known as “Warrior Forge,” which takes place during the summer between the junior and senior years. On a competitive basis, cadets may also attend other training during summer breaks. This training includes Army courses such as Airborne, Air Assault, Northern Warfare, and The Mountain Warfare. To be considered for this training, cadets must be intent on commissioning.</p> <p>Army ROTC is a demanding program that requires commitment from each cadet. However, the rewards more than equal the effort. All cadets will benefit from a greater understanding of their country and its Army, and from practical, demonstrated leadership ability. Those cadets who choose to serve, upon successful completion of the program and graduation from VMI, will commission as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Army, Army Reserve, or Army National Guard.</p> <h2><a name="Navy_and_Marine_Corps"></a>Navy and Marine Corps</h2> <p>The Naval ROTC program is a four-year course of instruction designed to provide cadets the opportunity to earn regular commissions in either the Navy or the Marine Corps. Cadets who enroll in the Naval Science courses receive instruction leading to possible careers in the air, on land and at sea. Additionally, the classes acquaint cadets with the Marine Corps and all elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force. Navy-option cadets will subsequently receive instruction in naval ship systems, navigation, ship operations, leadership and management. Marine-option cadets will study the evolution of warfare, leadership and amphibious warfare.</p> <p>The NROTC unit at VMI stresses the core values of honor, courage and commitment both in the classroom and through practical application designed to develop strong leadership skills. Activities outside the classroom include Navy and Marine Corps ceremonies and traditions, field training exercises and physical training. Two professional societies: Trident Society for Navyoption cadets and Semper Fi Society for Marine-option cadets, provide a forum for activities related specifically to each service. Field training exercises are dynamic events ranging from small unit tactics training at regional military bases to familiarization visits to operational ships and squadrons in the fleet.</p> <p>A cadet may become an NROTC midshipman either by selection for a national NROTC scholarship before matriculation at VMI or by nomination and selection after matriculation for either the scholarship or for the NROTC College Program. NROTC College Program cadets participate in NROTC classes and unit activities just like scholarship cadets. Advanced Standing College Program cadets do not receive scholarships but may receive monthly stipends of $350 during the junior year and $400 during the senior year. Graduation from VMI and completion of the Naval Science program can lead to a commission and service as a Navy or Marine Corps officer.</p> <h2><a name="Air_Force"></a>Air Force</h2> <p>The Air Force ROTC Program provides college-level education in order to qualify eligible cadets for commissioned service in the United States Air Force. The four-year program is offered in two distinct two-year courses: the General Military Course (GMC) and the Professional Officer Course (POC).</p> <p>The GMC concentrates on basic Air Force organization and air power history. Eligible GMC cadets may compete for a commission and are evaluated based on academics, physical fitness, and motivation. The POC is designed to build leadership and professional qualities by concentrating on the principles of leadership, management, and national security policies. AFROTC also sponsors a variety of extracurricular activities designed to increase leadership and management training and orient cadets to the Air Force. Such activities include base visits and a flight orientation program consisting of flying in a light aircraft operated by the Virginia Civil Air Patrol.</p> <p>Cadets may apply for career fields of their choice: such as pilot, combat systems officer, space and missile operations, research and development, and combat support. Entry into specific career fields depends on individual qualifications and the needs of the Air Force.</p> <p>A continuing need for officers with all backgrounds results in attractive scholarship opportunities. Students who accept an AFROTC scholarship incur the same basic service obligation as their non-scholarship counterparts. Scholarships range from two to four years in length and may cover full or partial tuition, $900 towards books and fees. AFROTC scholarships do not cover room and board or the VMI quartermaster charge.</p> <p>Successful completion of the AFROTC program results in a commission as a second lieutenant in the United States Air Force. The service obligation for non-flying officers is four years of active duty. For pilots and navigators, the service obligation is ten and six years, respectively, from completion of pilot and navigator training.

They are normally awarded by the services before matriculation at VMI; however, ROTC scholarships in college may become available for cadets based upon demonstrated performance, academic proficiency and motivation toward a service career. Details are available at each of the ROTC departments at VMI.</p> <p>Application deadlines for these scholarship programs normally fall near the end of the first semester of the senior year in high school.
