So is perhaps the biggest challenger in a democratic election a former dictator? Why is Goodluck Jonathan perhaps favored to win in spite of all the violence? Just what on earth is going on – social, political dynamics, currents?<br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> The reason why it may appear that Goodluck Jonathan has an early advantage would be that he has control over the patronage resources; he has control to some extent over the media and outflow of information, so he’ll use his considerable resources to make it appear as if he’s the likely winner. I probably would not bet on that being the actual fact.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> I think I would agree with that assessment. In fact, my first thought when you floated that idea was that I didn’t know that he was expected or favored to be the winner. On the contrary, many would argue that unless the ruling government does something underhanded he stands very little chance of winning the election. But to address specifically the issue of the Christian south controlling resources versus the Muslim, I think Nigeria is more nuanced than many people think. Not that long ago, if you remember, Moshood [Kashimawo Olawale] Abiola was said to have won what at that time [1993] were deemed the most free and fair elections in Nigeria’s history. What is often lost is that fact that both Abiola and [Baba Gana] Kingibe were Muslim, so a Muslim-Muslim ticket won overwhelming votes in Nigeria. It was General [Ibrahim] Babangida who nullified the election; in fact, that perpetrated a crisis referred to as June 12 that ultimately would lead to the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo because it was deemed that Abiola being from the southwest was deprived and therefore the southwest was owed the presidency. So when Obasanjo in 1999 was contesting the politicians from the north, the party deliberately did not contest for the nomination. It was actually handed to them. <br><br>What many people don’t realize is that sometimes the general Nigerian public yearns for military intervention in the face of just reckless corruption with impunity as is happening just right now. Security is usually a very important issue for any country, and there has been insecurity for years. And there is a general perception, and I will argue a reality, that the current government has been unable to address or to effectively handle the problem. The impression therefore is that being a strong military leader, perhaps that’s the kind of person that will be needed at this particular point in time to tackle the insurgency.<br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> When the United States was getting ready to allow Japan to elect its own leaders to free it from its [United States’] control and we were doing this because we wanted Japan to be a voluntary ally against the Soviet Union and the discussion was, well, Japan isn’t ready yet, they’ll probably choose an authoritative leader. And the response in Washington was, they need stability probably more than they need a Jeffersonian democracy. We in the West tend to think they [you] can telescope political development and think that you can get everything at once. I agree with James 100 percent. He may have been a dictator, but if he’s elected, he’s no longer a dictator, he’s an elected president first of all, and second of all the notion that he is a military man may resonate throughout the country and give them the stability that they need. <br><br>I think it’s frankly setting a bad precedent if Goodluck Jonathan does win. When he ascended to the presidency because the previous president died – I was in Nigeria at the time – and there were rumors of a coup d’etat and instability because he was breaking the tradition of alternating northerners and southerners, and frankly it’s probably a northerner’s time to be the president.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong> They call it the rotation of the presidency.<br><br>When Jonathan insisted and got re-elected, generally speaking including people like … President Obasanjo himself, say that he promised them that he was going to do just one additional term. So his now wanting to do another four years after doing six is viewed as breaking a promise, a solemn promise he had made. </p> 
       <h2>Who’s Fighting Whom?</h2> 
       <strong>Tombarge:</strong> Southern Nigeria, which is primarily responsible for Nigeria’s status as Africa’s biggest producer of oil, is far from the center of violence, Nigeria’s Muslim north, and Boko Haram, whose leader (I don’t dare try to say it)
       <br>
       <p><strong>Gire:</strong> Abubakar Shekau<br><br><strong>Tombarge:</strong> (There you go.) has referenced the “glory days of northern Nigeria’s medieval Muslim empires” (Julia Payne, Reuters, Nigerians face killings, hunger in Boko Haram's 'state,' Jan. 19, 2015). He seems to be at war with Nigeria’s Muslim center. So what’s going on? Who’s fighting who and where does this come from?<br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong> There is still conflict in the south, so let me go back to that first. The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram. So why? This doesn’t really answer your question, but I think it’s really important. The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press. The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they’re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative. So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to. When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up, it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got. Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta. The conflict in the Niger Delta, though, is still a serious conflict, and it’s still a serious problem. So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously, both – and this is from an academic perspective, what I like to look at – both in peripheral areas far from the center, the center being Lagos and Abuja, and in Nigerian politics, the periphery, whether it’s the south or the north, have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake. There are a lot of drivers to this conflict – I’m sure between James and me we’ll come up with a whole bunch – certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources, and it is not equitable, and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it, a place at the table to eat.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta. The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control; they’ve been ignored for so long. They believe that in the areas where the bulk of the oil was derived, and if you’ve seen oil spills here – what BP was made to go through and so on – there’ve been tons of spills across the oil-producing areas <br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong>And gas flaring<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> and gas flares, and it’s an environmental disaster. And because of the complacency of the central government and so on, efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate, leaving the people, some of whom are fishermen, unable to engage in very fulfilling day-to-day sustenance. And so the violence was to bring attention and say, “Hey, we’re here, and you’ve got to take care of these issues that we’ve been raving about.” And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that.<br><br>With respect to Boko Haram in the north, it’s a little bit different. That is [a] principally religious kind of thing, and that’s why it’s scary, and that’s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention. Because Boko Haram’s intentions are to Islamize the whole country, including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south. And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north, guess what their next target is going to be? So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries. As Jim can testify, right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger, in Chad, in Cameroon – these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria, sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth.<br><br>They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors. They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee. In fact, in the early days of Boko Haram when they emerged in 2002, they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban. And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country, so that’s why other Muslims are not safe, if they’re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values.<br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong>The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons: it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear. You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer. Within Nigeria, some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta, although it provides 98 percent of the state’s revenues. But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time. While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency – meaning, “We want to reform the nature of the state” – there’s now side by side (maybe a better word would be integrated) with that a warlord conflict, what we call a war economy. And so there are insurgency groups – and there’s an alphabet soup list of them – who actually make money off the conflict through, in particular, bunkering, where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines. Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors. They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians. So there’s many dimensions.<br><br>There’s another element to that conflict. The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden. The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam, but he was also saying that people with western education, which was mostly southerners, are dominating the government. And these southerners that dominate the government, which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated, or Western educated, so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam, it’s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government, which means they weren’t getting the resources they believe they should have. <br><br>It’s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim, it’s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong> Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria, so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country. At the same time, though, the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria, and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria, Ahmadu Bello, is believed to have delayed Nigeria’s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready, that if they had given independence at that time, the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners. So there’s a vestige of that. What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigerian not so much as just Christian-Muslim per se, but as a few individuals who collude, who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power. So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves. They are using that tool to get an advantage.<br><br>I think at the bottom of it all is to [have] control of the powerful economic resources that are available.<br><br><strong>Hentz</strong>: There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict, that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict, in other words it was more about power than it was about religion. And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad, into Cameroon, into Niger, as it is, you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons. So it may be that at the heart of this conflict – I’m talking about Boko Haram, it’s an Islamic conflict – it’s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders. And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya, these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks. These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it’s almost impossible to untangle them. People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons. James, it’s not just religious. It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms, I’m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return. We call this again a war economy. And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram, more so than the Niger Delta, which has been a remarkably self-contained conflict – it has not spread really (it’s in the Niger Delta; it’s spread a little bit in Nigeria: I’m talking about across borders.) Boko Haram has a different logic. The contagion effect there is much more severe. And I would argue because it’s following the 400-year-old trading routes in that part of the world. They’re not doing anything different than what’s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate. They’re just adapting what they want to do, their trading networks, their conflicts, to age-old Trans-Sahel trading routes and alliances. And it’s a very fluid situation.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever, even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria. You probably read this too, Jim. The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers.<br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> That’s another dimension of the conflict.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria.<br><br>They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this. Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of. It’s something that’s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests. But there’s also a broader, more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf, who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau, that’s much broader. In fact, the original founder, this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy, the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder, was born in 1927 or something. And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied. And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not [the] prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will. So it dates way back.<br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong> To add to what James said, I think what we’re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict, not a Nigerian conflict. And recently the United States is sort of, I don’t know if the word is celebrating, bragging, happy, that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram. So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface. The Chadian Army, though, is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims, so now you’re bringing in another group, of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to [Gen. Idriss] Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims, which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active. Again, from the U.S. foreign policy perspective – something that I look at – we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem. We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here. And it’s not just northeast Nigeria. It’s the trans-Sahel, it’s Nigeria, it’s the south – it’s history. I mean, as James was talking about, you need to go all the way back to the 1920s to understand how this Boko Haram evolved.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> That is a very apt analogy, Jim. In fact, in some ways you can draw parallels with what’s going on with ISIL in Syria. Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth. Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it. So in at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites. Guess what. It has now morphed out of control. And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened because this stuff has ballooned beyond what the initial expectations were. So this has the potential to be really a wide-scale problem if it’s not contained. </p> 
       <h2>‘Training the Trainers’ in Niger</h2> 
       <strong>Tombarge:</strong> Jim, I know you just returned from Niger?
       <br>
       <p><strong>Hentz: I</strong> did. I did.<br><br><strong>Tombarge:</strong> I was sort of interested in having you talk a little bit – weren’t you working this problem over there from some angle?<br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> I was. Well, indirectly. My trip to Niger was to what they call ‘train the trainers.” So I was part of a three-man team helping train the instructors at the Nigerian military academy. And the instructors whom I was with are on typically a two-year rotation. They either have been to the front, which is Boko Haram, or they’re going back to the front. Or the soldiers they’re training are going back and forth from the front. Just days after I left Niger they had riots – I don’t know if you’re aware of this - literally days after I came back as a response to what France was doing and the cartoons and burnt down some churches and set some hotels on fire. I haven’t found out if my hotel was set on fire. I don’t know if I want to know if my hotel was set on fire. But Niger is a strong American ally right now. We’re working very well with them. But the same substratum exists there as in northern Nigeria: These young men that are easily recruited into these sort of extremist movements because their lives just flat out are not very good and they see this as an option, maybe the only option. Niger’s not doing that, they’re not in there, but it’s remarkable how I’m there working as a representative of the United States government helping to promote U.S.- Nigerien relations and cooperation specifically in the fight against Islamic terrorism in the Trans-Sahel and four days later there’s riots in the capital because of their reaction to the political cartoons depicting the prophet in France. So it’s a tinderbox. This part of the world is a tinderbox.</p> 
       <h2>Reflections on Life in Nigeria</h2> 
       <strong>Tombarge: </strong> James, you also have spent a lot time actually in Nigeria and have just returned, so you’ve been there very recently? 
       <br>
       <p><strong>Gire:</strong> Yes.<br><br><strong>Tombarge: </strong> And you’ve spent a lot of time sort of working with developing higher education there, and I know you’ve noted a real thirst for it. It’s a rare commodity, although we were just talking about education in the south. So I guess I’m wondering, there must be some people that go to work every day there, that try to live regular lives, and all of this is happening around them? So do you have things to say about what Nigeria’s like now?<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is, I would imagine, one of the most optimistic persons out there. They have ambitions for education, for raising families, for having their children as well as themselves be successful. Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram, a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet, which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important. Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption, particularly in the central government, then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there. To give you an idea – many people view the current government as being … especially when it comes to corruption. A couple of examples will suffice. The president, upon responding to aspects of corruption will say some thing like this: Well people are so bent on talking about corruption that they sometimes will label common stealing as corruption. One time he says everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria when you build a very good house, you’re viewed as being corrupt, which is surprising because if you’re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50,000 naira a month, which is not that much, if you don’t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on, and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house, it has to be labeled as something. Where did you get the money from? And then in responding to why, along with India and China and so on, how there is general wealth but there is a lot of poverty in Nigeria, he said Nigeria is not poor because Nigeria is among the top 10 percent in the world in owning private jets. And that is precisely the problem. So people view this as well as the general insecurity as the basis to say we have what it takes, the elements are in place to have a viable, vibrant economy if only we get the right people at the helm to harness this. In their view, and this is the interesting thing – maybe going back to the first thing we discussed, which was [the] Muslim north and Christian south – there is for the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition has developed. Let me tell you why the north used to almost emerge as political leaders any time they had elections. In terms of population, it has more population than the south. But Nigeria has three major components: there’s the north, there’s the southwest and there’s the southeast. The interesting thing is that even though both southwest and southeast were Christian, the predominantly Yoruba southwest and the predominantly Igbo southeast they were not always political partners. So the north would for the most part partner with the southeast and that gave the power. … What has changed now the southwest, the second biggest political block to the north is now aligned with the north. Which is why my first comment was I didn’t know the current president was favored because the political alliance between the southwest and the north right now is such a gigantic portion of the electorate that I’m not sure where the president is going to get his votes from.<br><br>People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard-working people, some of the most resourceful people out there, that the government has been in the way. And therefore if they could only bring in a government that is interested and going to work for the people, that their country is just going to go to good places. <br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> The culture of corruption is persuasive, in Nigeria as it is in other countries. I think at some level, there’s a level of, if not acceptance of corruption, almost the notion that this is something we have to live with. And I’ll give you an interesting anecdotal story. I was traveling back from the Niger Delta to the airport, and we were listening to the Nigerian radio. And they were reporting on the revelation that the president of the Philippines had $100,000 hidden in a bank account – I think the number was $100,000. The two Nigerian announcers started laughing and said, “$100,000? One of our governors would be embarrassed if they only had $100,000 in their bank account.” And it was just the way they joked about it and laughed about it that made you realize that this is something that they deal with on a daily basis and you wonder if they’re accepting it, not because they think it’s right but because accepting that it’s a part of their daily life.<br><br>With the regions, with the traditional three regions, … within each of those regions you have ethnic minorities which are very important. When Nigeria was formed it had three states.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong> Three regions.<br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> Three regions; it now has 36 states, and the proliferation of states over time was essentially a way to create what we call in political science “prebends.” Prebends are the riches that come with holding office; the more offices you create, the more governorships you create – and I’m not even talking about localities – I forget, what are there 180-something local governments? Every government structure you create whether it’s state or what they call locality is another opportunity to attach prebends, wealth, patronage attached to the office. So not only is there an issue of corruption, there is an issue of institutionalized corruption over the last 30 or 40 years.<br><br><strong>Gire:</strong> That’s a very important point, Jim, and I think I’ll be more than happy to elaborate, to give you some interesting dimension to that. Yes, corruption has been around forever, in fact almost every military takeover, corruption was one of the reasons cited for the military taking over, but here’s what has happened: To some extent it has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on, but it’s a matter of magnitude. To give you a sense, it used to be that people who, say you are in charge of awarding contracts and so one and somebody bids for it you might cut some deal with someone to get 10 percent and that was viewed as a horrible thing. And then 10 percent went to maybe like 20 and 30. What has happened right now, which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable, … an example will be somebody who holds office has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract, maybe for a bridge, 100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge. None. Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality. That’s the current state. And even for Nigerians, that is too much. Which is why [Muhammadu] Buhari … is out there. Remember, a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians, Buhari’s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria. OK, Buhari, when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago, laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there. He said, “I was a military general and a head of state. I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me.” He said, “I have no single foreign bank accounts. None. If you associate any bank account to my name that is not Nigerian, I beg you to bring it forth.” He said, “I have two houses, one in Kaduna and one in Fantora. I don’t have a plot in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, I don’t have a house in Abuja.” He said, “If you know of anything, bring it forth.” No other Nigerian politician who has had opportunity – he was minister of petroleum, he was military president of Nigeria, he was the chair of the petroleum trust fund which was a fund created to use resources from petroleum for capital projects such as roads and big buildings and so forth. And he built roads. This is on record. Nigerians know this. So the only thing if you look at Jonathan’s campaign the only thing is “Buhari cannot memorize his phone number. Buhari is not educated. Buhari is too old.” He has not touched in terms of Buhari’s integrity. Read the papers about the campaigns, about the issues that have been raised. People are just fed up. In other words, Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption whereby $20 million have been allotted to build, say, a political science building at the university, you actually see it built, maybe it took $15 million to build it, people say, “OK, maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that.” To some extent that has been accepted. What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted. When we’re talking about corruption, that’s the magnitude that has been at work here. So Nigerians have lived with corruption but never with this level that is going on at this current time.<br></p> 
       <h2>Can Conflict in Nigeria Threaten the United States?</h2> 
       <p><strong>Tombarge</strong>: OK, maybe one last question. Is Boko Haram and maybe more broadly the Nigerian unrest, is that a threat to the West?<br><br><strong>Hentz: </strong>That was asked on the Sunday talk shows, this Sunday. I usually watch a handful of them. Every single one asked, why the focus on ISIL. Boko Haram is killing as many people. They haven’t done as well playing CNN, with you know, Jihad Joe, and the answer from the Washington insiders, these were, you know, joint chiefs of staff type people, is that no, we’re keeping a close eye on north and west Africa, we do think it’s a national security concern for the United States. Yes, the Middle East, ISIL are sort of taking front-page news. And I can also tell you as somebody who does some consulting for the U.S., there I was on the phone for an hour two days ago with somebody traveling to Niger and Mali and the borderline areas, setting up programs trying to drain what we call the swamp, which means creating programs for men and women to change the opportunity costs of joining the insurgency, make it so that this isn’t the only option. So I think we’re pretty well aware. ISIL’s got [the] front page. France grabbed the front page. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen’s up there, but I think you’re going to see over the next year that not just Boko Haram again but the whole Trans-Sahel area is going to be a high priority for U.S. national security.<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong>I absolutely agree that it is a problem. And … at this point would be a mistake because it’s just like within Nigeria when it first started the central government ignored it and it was just some distraction and it just continued to grow to the point where it is now. What is interesting, … with the situation in France [that] killed a few people; at that same time 2,000 people were killed in Nigeria. In fact even other African countries [that] sometimes refrain from criticizing Nigeria came down hard against Jonathan because he was one of the first leaders to send words of sympathy to France and had not mentioned a word about the 2,000 people that were killed in his own country. More than that, Boko Haram didn’t start initially in terms of physical violence, it just progressed over time. The activities are becoming not only more explosive but more sophisticated. The general belief now is that they have training links with Al Qaeda. So if we’re interested in Al Qaeda in Yemen, we ought to be interested in Boko Haram in Nigeria or other similar groups as well because eventually, there’s going to be that link. Now what is happening, Jim being the scholarly expert in this area may bring his perspective as well, it is coming to a point where it is no longer block, big blocks groups like ISIL or Boko Haram, but the influence they have on young people, which is interesting mentioning draining the swamp, the folks who carried out the attacks on France and so on were not foreigners, they were French citizens, who had influence there. They come back with the passports of their own countries; they’re not viewed as groups, but they’re the most difficult to stop. And so it’s in everyone’s interest to recognize this for the serious problem that it is and ensure that it does not spread because otherwise it will splinter into these little fragments that are very difficult to contain from a broad national attack perspective. You can’t take the U.S. army against a few individuals who just returned from Syria, one of whom is in Kansas, one of whom is in Maine, another of whom is from a different part of the country. How are you going to use the forces as currently put together? <br><br><strong>Hentz:</strong> I would add a couple of things. Again, we are paying attention. I should have mentioned that the U.S. military has an operation called Operation Flintlock, which is I think is in its third iteration if not [the] fourth, where the U.S military holds an exercise in the Trans-Sahel, which is a multinational exercise bringing the different armies together to cooperate. This year it’s going to be held in Chad, I think just next month probably. Back to comparing it to ISIL or to Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula, all over the news right now is this notion that ISIL and AQAP are going to start trying to outbid each other for the more outstanding terrorist event – you can call this the CNN effect on steroids, right? If you want to get on the news, you have to be the one who does the most spectacular event. I don’t know why they don’t bring Boko Haram in here too. Shekau likes to be on TV. He likes publicity, and in fact, it’s kind of we’re back to James’s 2,000. It’s look at me, I just killed 2,000 people and you’re not even looking at me. I’m guessing, the amateur psychiatrist in me – [pointing at Gire] he’s the psychologist -- says, he’s going back saying, oh what do I have to do now, to get on TV, right? So all these different conflicts are linked, and then one last point, I think, not only do we have to take a regional approach, we have to take a holistic approach. We have to understand in a globalized world how events in France affect Niger, how events in Tunisia affect Libya, how events in Libya affect Nigeria, how events in Yemen affect Boko Haram. This is not just a regional challenge, this is a global challenge, from Minnesota to Paris to London to Nigeria, this is a global challenge so when you ignore one part of that challenge, you’re making the entire challenge bigger, so you need to pay attention to Boko Haram or else the problem will get bigger.<br></p> 
       <h2>A Limit to How Much You Can Ignore</h2> 
       <p><br><strong>Tombarge:</strong> OK, I guess we’re going to wrap this up. Do either one of you have anything you want to add anything in thinking about the goings-on in Nigeria?<br><br><strong>Gire: </strong>The most important thing in the foreseeable future, which is in about three weeks, is the forthcoming elections, which is interesting that you started with that. It has the potential to change, I think, maybe things for the better. In my view, not the individual in terms of … but the overall message. The central government has been in power since they started the PDP, the People’s Democratic Party as we call it, in 1999 when the fourth republic was started, and … so a lot of the belief among the people is that so long as the same people get voted back, there is no incentive to actually address the real problems of the regular Nigerian, so a change at the center would be a signal that there’s a limit to how much you can ignore. And so whichever government that comes in will be cognizant that the other guys, we kicked them out because they didn’t do so good. So they’ll be more likely to at least try to address it even if for the selfish purpose of trying to retain power.<br><br><font size="2">Copyright © 2015 Virginia Military Institute.
