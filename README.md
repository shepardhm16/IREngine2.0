# IREngine2.0
###Updated IR Engine Files <br>
[Includes all of the source code for the CIS-443-01 IREngine project.]

###Team Members:<br>

2.)  Benjamin Chong <br>
3.)  Zachary Carter <br>
4.)  John D'Antonio <br>
<br><br>
###Revision History:<br>
* IREngine_2.0/master - 14 April 2016 - Original files<br>
* IREngine_2.0/update - 15 April 2016 - first update, not functioning<br>
* IREngine_2.0/IREngine2.3 - 17 April 2016 - Ignore, a failed attempt just waiting to be deleted <br>
* IREngine_2.0/IREngine2.4 - 18 April 2016 - Contains all documents and TermTable; still needs indexing files<br>

### Work to be Completed:
1.)  We need to refine the code for postings building; currently, it does not work
2.)  We need to decide on the weights for the different indexing files
3.)  We need to verify that all of the correct information is in each area of the workspace folder

Work off of the latest update, see what you can get done.
