As a new volunteer  I have found the staff and other volunteers at New Market Battlefield welcoming and helpful  My first activities were both fun and personally rewarding  I look forward to being more involved in future programs Having moved here from GA  I was ready to learn about Civil War Virginia  and becoming a volunteer at the battlefield has helped me tremendously  History comes alive for me at the park Being a volunteer is a wonderful way to share your love of history historical interpretation with a super group of people dedicated to educating the public  History is not a dead bore it s alive and fun for the whole family
