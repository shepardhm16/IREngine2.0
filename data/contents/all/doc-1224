this document  John T  L  Preston  portrait at right  was one of the founders of the Virginia Military Institute and one of its first faculty members  This letter  written to his wife  was published in the Lexington  VA  Gazette  December 15  1859  More about this topic  Full Text  Charles Town  Dec  2  1859 The execution is over  we have just returned from the field and I sit down to give you some account of it  The weather was very favorable  the sky was a little overcast  with a gentle haze in the atmosphere that softened without obscuring the magnificent prospect afforded here Between eight and nine o clock  the troops began to put themselves in motion to occupy the positions assigned to them on the field  as designated on the plan I send you  To Col  Smith had been assigned the superintendence of the execution  and he and his staff were the only mounted officers on the ground  until the Major General and his staff appeared  By ten o clock all was arranged  The general effect was most imposing  and  at the same time  picturesque  The cadets were immediately in rear of the gallows with a howitzer on the right and left  a little behind  so as to sweep the field  They were uniformed in red flannel shirts  which gave them a gay  dashing  Zouave look  and was exceedingly becoming  especially at the Battery  They were flanked obliquely by two corps  the Richmond Grays  Greys  and Company F  which if inferior in appearance to the cadets  were superior to any other company I ever saw outside of the regular army  Other companies were distributed over the field  amounting in all to about 800 men  The military force was about 1 500  The whole enclosure was lined by cavalry troops posted as sentinels  with their officers one on a peerless black horse  and another on a remarkable looking white horse  continually dashing round the enclosure  Outside this enclosure were other companies acting as rangers and scouts  The jail was guarded by several companies of infantry  an pieces of artillery were put in position for its defense  Shortly before eleven o clock the prisoner was taken from the jail  and the funeral cortege was put in motion  First came three companies  then the criminal s wagon  drawn by two large white horses  John Brown was seated on his coffin  accompanied by the sheriff and two other persons  The wagon drove to the foot of the gallows  and Brown descended with alacrity and without assistance  and ascended the steep steps to the platform  His demeanor was intrepid  without being braggart  He made no speech  whether he desired to make one or not  I do not know  Had he desired it  it would not have been permitted  Any speech of his must  of necessity  have been unlawful  and as being directed against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth  and as such could not be allowed by those who were then engaged in the most solemn and extreme vindication of law  His manner was without trepidation  but his countenance was not free from concern  and it seemed to me to have a little cast of wildness  He stood upon the scaffold but a short time  giving brief adieus to those about him  when he was properly pinioned  the white cap drawn over his face  the noose adjusted and attached to the hook above  and he was moved blindfold a few steps forward  It was curious to note how the instincts of nature operated to make him careful in putting his feet as if afraid he would walk off the scaffold  The man who stood unblanched on the brink of eternity was afraid of falling a few feet to the ground  He was now all ready  The sheriff asked him if he should give him a private signal before the fatal moment  He replied in a voice that seemed to me unnaturally natural  so composed was its tone  and so distinct its articulation  that  it did not matter to him  if only they would not keep him too long waiting  He was kept waiting  however  The troops that had formed his escort had to be put into their position  and while this was going on  he stood for some ten or fifteen minutes blindfold  the rope around his neck  and his feet on the treacherous platform  expecting instantly the fatal act  But he stood for this comparatively long time upright as a soldier in position  and motionless  I was close to him  and watched him narrowly  to see if I could perceive any signs of shrinking or trembling in his person  but there was none  Once I thought I saw his knees tremble  but it was only the wind blowing his loose trousers  His firmness was subjected to still further trial by hearing Colonel Smith announce to the sheriff   We are all ready  Mr  Campbell  The sheriff did not hear  or did not comprehend  and in a louder tone the same announcement was made  But the culprit still stood ready until the sheriff  descending the flight of steps  with a well directed blow of a sharp hatchet  severed the rope that held up the trap door  which instantly sank beneath him  and he fell about three feet  and the man of strong and bloody hand  of fierce passions  of iron will  of wonderful vicissitudes  the terrible partisan of Kansas  the capturer of the United States Arsenal at Harper s Ferry  the would be Catiline of the South  the demi god of the abolitionists  the man execrated and lauded  damned and prayed for  the man who in his motives  his means  his plans  and his successes  must ever be a wonder  a puzzle  and a mystery John Brown was hanging between heaven and earth  There was profound stillness during the time his struggles continued  growing feebler and feebler at each abortive attempt to breathe  He knees were scarcely bent  his arms were drawn up to a right angle at the elbow  with the hands clenched  but there was no writhing of the body  no violent heaving of the chest  At each feebler effort at respiration his arms sank lower  and his legs hung more relaxed  until at last  straight and lank he dangled  swayed to and fro by the wind  It was a moment of deep solemnity  and suggestive of thoughts that make the bosom swell  The field of execution was a rising ground  and commanded the outstretching valley from mountain to mountain  and their still grandeur gave sublimity to the outline  while it so chanced that white clouds resting upon them  gave them the appearance that reminded more than one of us of the snow peaks of the Alps  Before us was the greatest array of disciplined forces ever seen in Virginia  infantry  cavalry and artillery combined  composed of the old Commonwealth s noblest sons  and commanded by her best officers  and the great canopy of the sky overarching all  came to add its sublimity ever present  but only realized when other great things are occurring beneath each  But the moral of the scene was its grand point  A sovereign state had been assailed  and she had uttered but a hint  and her sons had hastened to show that they were ready to defend her  Law had been violated by actual murder and attempted treason  and that gibbet was erected by law  and to uphold law was this military force assembled  But  greater still God s Holy Law and righteous Providence was vindicated   Thou shalt not kill   Whoso sheddeth man s blood  by man shall his blood be shed  And here the gray haired man of violence meets his fate  after he has seen his two sons cut down before him  in the same career of violence into which he had introduced them  So perish all such enemies of Virginia  All such enemies of the Union  All such foes of the human race  So I felt  and so I said  with solemnity and without one shade of animosity  as I turned to break the silence  to those around me  Yet  the mystery was awful  to see the human form thus treated by men  to see life suddenly stopped in its current  and to ask one s self the question without answer And what then  In all that array there was not  I suppose  one throb of sympathy for the offender  All felt in the depths of their hearts that it was right  On the other hand  there was not one single word or gesture of exultation or of insult  From the beginning to the end  all was marked by the most absolute decorum and solemnity  There was no military music  no saluting by troops as they passed one another  nor anything done for show  The criminal hung upon the gallows for nearly forty minutes  and after being examined by a whole staff of surgeons  was deposited in a neat coffin to be delivered to his friends  and transported to Harper s Ferry  where his wife awaited it  She came in company with two persons to see her husband last night  and returned to Harper s Ferry this morning  She is described by those who saw her as a very large  masculine woman  of absolute composure of manner  The officers who witnessed their meeting in the jail said they met as if nothing unusual had taken place  and had a comfortable supper together  Brown would not have the assistance of any Minister in jail during his last days  nor their presence with him on the scaffold  In going from prison to the place of execution  he said very little  only assuring those who were with him that he had no fear  nor had he at any time in his life  known what fear was  When he entered the gate of the enclosure  he expressed his admiration of the beauty of the surrounding country  and pointing to different residences  asked who were the owners of them  There was a very small crowd to witness the execution  Governor Wise and General Taliaferro had both issued proclamations exhorting the citizens to remain at home and guard their property  and warned them of possible danger  The train on the Winchester Railroad had been stopped from carrying passengers  and even passengers on the Baltimore Rairoad were subjected to examination and detention  An arrangement was made to divide the expected crowed into recognized citizens  and those not recognized  to require the former to go to the right  and the latter to the left  Of the latter there was not a single one  it was told last night there were not in Charles Town ten persons besides citizens and military  There is but one opinion as to the completeness of the arrangements made on the occasion  and the absolute success with which they were carried out  I have said something about the striking effect of the pageant as a pageant  but the excellence of it was that everything was arranged solely with the view of efficiency  and not for effect upon the eye  Had it been intended as a mere spectacle  it could not have been made more imposing  or had actual need occurred  it was the best possible arrangement  You may be inclined to ask was all this necessary  I have not time to enter upon the question now  Governor Wise thought it necessary  and he said he had reliable information  The responsibility of calling out the force rests with him  It only remained for those under his orders to dispose the force in the best manner  That this was done is unquestionable  and  whatever credit is due for it  may fairly be claimed by those who accomplished it  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non

Eyewitness Account  About this document  John T  L  Preston  portrait at right  was one of the founders of the Virginia Military Institute and one of its first faculty members  This letter  written to his wife  was published in the Lexington  VA  Gazette  December 15  1859  More about this topic  Full Text  Charles Town  Dec  2  1859 The execution is over  we have just returned from the field and I sit down to give you some account of it  The weather was very favorable  the sky was a little overcast  with a gentle haze in the atmosphere that softened without obscuring the magnificent prospect afforded here Between eight and nine o clock  the troops began to put themselves in motion to occupy the positions assigned to them on the field  as designated on the plan I send you  To Col  Smith had been assigned the superintendence of the execution  and he and his staff were the only mounted officers on the ground  until the Major General and his staff appeared  By ten o clock all was arranged  The general effect was most imposing  and  at the same time  picturesque  The cadets were immediately in rear of the gallows with a howitzer on the right and left  a little behind  so as to sweep the field  They were uniformed in red flannel shirts  which gave them a gay  dashing  Zouave look  and was exceedingly becoming  especially at the Battery  They were flanked obliquely by two corps  the Richmond Grays  Greys  and Company F  which if inferior in appearance to the cadets  were superior to any other company I ever saw outside of the regular army  Other companies were distributed over the field  amounting in all to about 800 men  The military force was about 1 500  The whole enclosure was lined by cavalry troops posted as sentinels  with their officers one on a peerless black horse  and another on a remarkable looking white horse  continually dashing round the enclosure  Outside this enclosure were other companies acting as rangers and scouts  The jail was guarded by several companies of infantry  an pieces of artillery were put in position for its defense  Shortly before eleven o clock the prisoner was taken from the jail  and the funeral cortege was put in motion  First came three companies  then the criminal s wagon  drawn by two large white horses  John Brown was seated on his coffin  accompanied by the sheriff and two other persons  The wagon drove to the foot of the gallows  and Brown descended with alacrity and without assistance  and ascended the steep steps to the platform  His demeanor was intrepid  without being braggart  He made no speech  whether he desired to make one or not  I do not know  Had he desired it  it would not have been permitted  Any speech of his must  of necessity  have been unlawful  and as being directed against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth  and as such could not be allowed by those who were then engaged in the most solemn and extreme vindication of law  His manner was without trepidation  but his countenance was not free from concern  and it seemed to me to have a little cast of wildness  He stood upon the scaffold but a short time  giving brief adieus to those about him  when he was properly pinioned  the white cap drawn over his face  the noose adjusted and attached to the hook above  and he was moved blindfold a few steps forward  It was curious to note how the instincts of nature operated to make him careful in putting his feet as if afraid he would walk off the scaffold  The man who stood unblanched on the brink of eternity was afraid of falling a few feet to the ground  He was now all ready  The sheriff asked him if he should give him a private signal before the fatal moment  He replied in a voice that seemed to me unnaturally natural  so composed was its tone  and so distinct its articulation  that  it did not matter to him  if only they would not keep him too long waiting  He was kept waiting  however  The troops that had formed his escort had to be put into their position  and while this was going on  he stood for some ten or fifteen minutes blindfold  the rope around his neck  and his feet on the treacherous platform  expecting instantly the fatal act  But he stood for this comparatively long time upright as a soldier in position  and motionless  I was close to him  and watched him narrowly  to see if I could perceive any signs of shrinking or trembling in his person  but there was none  Once I thought I saw his knees tremble  but it was only the wind blowing his loose trousers  His firmness was subjected to still further trial by hearing Colonel Smith announce to the sheriff   We are all ready  Mr  Campbell  The sheriff did not hear  or did not comprehend  and in a louder tone the same announcement was made  But the culprit still stood ready until the sheriff  descending the flight of steps  with a well directed blow of a sharp hatchet  severed the rope that held up the trap door  which instantly sank beneath him  and he fell about three feet  and the man of strong and bloody hand  of fierce passions  of iron will  of wonderful vicissitudes  the terrible partisan of Kansas  the capturer of the United States Arsenal at Harper s Ferry  the would be Catiline of the South  the demi god of the abolitionists  the man execrated and lauded  damned and prayed for  the man who in his motives  his means  his plans  and his successes  must ever be a wonder  a puzzle  and a mystery John Brown was hanging between heaven and earth  There was profound stillness during the time his struggles continued  growing feebler and feebler at each abortive attempt to breathe  He knees were scarcely bent  his arms were drawn up to a right angle at the elbow  with the hands clenched  but there was no writhing of the body  no violent heaving of the chest  At each feebler effort at respiration his arms sank lower  and his legs hung more relaxed  until at last  straight and lank he dangled  swayed to and fro by the wind  It was a moment of deep solemnity  and suggestive of thoughts that make the bosom swell  The field of execution was a rising ground  and commanded the outstretching valley from mountain to mountain  and their still grandeur gave sublimity to the outline  while it so chanced that white clouds resting upon them  gave them the appearance that reminded more than one of us of the snow peaks of the Alps  Before us was the greatest array of disciplined forces ever seen in Virginia  infantry  cavalry and artillery combined  composed of the old Commonwealth s noblest sons  and commanded by her best officers  and the great canopy of the sky overarching all  came to add its sublimity ever present  but only realized when other great things are occurring beneath each  But the moral of the scene was its grand point  A sovereign state had been assailed  and she had uttered but a hint  and her sons had hastened to show that they were ready to defend her  Law had been violated by actual murder and attempted treason  and that gibbet was erected by law  and to uphold law was this military force assembled  But  greater still God s Holy Law and righteous Providence was vindicated   Thou shalt not kill   Whoso sheddeth man s blood  by man shall his blood be shed  And here the gray haired man of violence meets his fate  after he has seen his two sons cut down before him  in the same career of violence into which he had introduced them  So perish all such enemies of Virginia  All such enemies of the Union  All such foes of the human race  So I felt  and so I said  with solemnity and without one shade of animosity  as I turned to break the silence  to those around me  Yet  the mystery was awful  to see the human form thus treated by men  to see life suddenly stopped in its current  and to ask one s self the question without answer And what then  In all that array there was not  I suppose  one throb of sympathy for the offender  All felt in the depths of their hearts that it was right

Execution  Eyewitness John T  L  Preston  The Execution of John Brown Preston Eyewitness Account  About this document  John T  L  Preston  portrait at right  was one of the founders of the Virginia Military Institute and one of its first faculty members  This letter  written to his wife  was published in the Lexington  VA  Gazette  December 15  1859  More about this topic  Full Text  Charles Town  Dec  2  1859 The execution is over  we have just returned from the field and I sit down to give you some account of it  The weather was very favorable  the sky was a little overcast  with a gentle haze in the atmosphere that softened without obscuring the magnificent prospect afforded here Between eight and nine o clock  the troops began to put themselves in motion to occupy the positions assigned to them on the field  as designated on the plan I send you  To Col  Smith had been assigned the superintendence of the execution  and he and his staff were the only mounted officers on the ground  until the Major General and his staff appeared  By ten o clock all was arranged  The general effect was most imposing  and  at the same time  picturesque  The cadets were immediately in rear of the gallows with a howitzer on the right and left  a little behind  so as to sweep the field  They were uniformed in red flannel shirts  which gave them a gay  dashing  Zouave look  and was exceedingly becoming  especially at the Battery  They were flanked obliquely by two corps  the Richmond Grays  Greys  and Company F  which if inferior in appearance to the cadets  were superior to any other company I ever saw outside of the regular army  Other companies were distributed over the field  amounting in all to about 800 men  The military force was about 1 500  The whole enclosure was lined by cavalry troops posted as sentinels  with their officers one on a peerless black horse  and another on a remarkable looking white horse  continually dashing round the enclosure  Outside this enclosure were other companies acting as rangers and scouts  The jail was guarded by several companies of infantry  an pieces of artillery were put in position for its defense  Shortly before eleven o clock the prisoner was taken from the jail  and the funeral cortege was put in motion  First came three companies  then the criminal s wagon  drawn by two large white horses  John Brown was seated on his coffin  accompanied by the sheriff and two other persons  The wagon drove to the foot of the gallows  and Brown descended with alacrity and without assistance  and ascended the steep steps to the platform  His demeanor was intrepid  without being braggart  He made no speech  whether he desired to make one or not  I do not know  Had he desired it  it would not have been permitted  Any speech of his must  of necessity  have been unlawful  and as being directed against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth  and as such could not be allowed by those who were then engaged in the most solemn and extreme vindication of law  His manner was without trepidation  but his countenance was not free from concern  and it seemed to me to have a little cast of wildness  He stood upon the scaffold but a short time  giving brief adieus to those about him  when he was properly pinioned  the white cap drawn over his face  the noose adjusted and attached to the hook above  and he was moved blindfold a few steps forward  It was curious to note how the instincts of nature operated to make him careful in putting his feet as if afraid he would walk off the scaffold  The man who stood unblanched on the brink of eternity was afraid of falling a few feet to the ground  He was now all ready  The sheriff asked him if he should give him a private signal before the fatal moment  He replied in a voice that seemed to me unnaturally natural  so composed was its tone  and so distinct its articulation  that  it did not matter to him  if only they would not keep him too long waiting  He was kept waiting  however  The troops that had formed his escort had to be put into their position  and while this was going on  he stood for some ten or fifteen minutes blindfold  the rope around his neck  and his feet on the treacherous platform  expecting instantly the fatal act  But he stood for this comparatively long time upright as a soldier in position  and motionless  I was close to him  and watched him narrowly  to see if I could perceive any signs of shrinking or trembling in his person  but there was none  Once I thought I saw his knees tremble  but it was only the wind blowing his loose trousers  His firmness was subjected to still further trial by hearing Colonel Smith announce to the sheriff   We are all ready  Mr  Campbell  The sheriff did not hear  or did not comprehend  and in a louder tone the same announcement was made  But the culprit still stood ready until the sheriff  descending the flight of steps  with a well directed blow of a sharp hatchet  severed the rope that held up the trap door  which instantly sank beneath him  and he fell about three feet  and the man of strong and bloody hand  of fierce passions  of iron will  of wonderful vicissitudes  the terrible partisan of Kansas  the capturer of the United States Arsenal at Harper s Ferry  the would be Catiline of the South  the demi god of the abolitionists  the man execrated and lauded  damned and prayed for  the man who in his motives  his means  his plans  and his successes  must ever be a wonder  a puzzle  and a mystery John Brown was hanging between heaven and earth  There was profound stillness during the time his struggles continued  growing feebler and feebler at each abortive attempt to breathe  He knees were scarcely bent  his arms were drawn up to a right angle at the elbow  with the hands clenched  but there was no writhing of the body  no violent heaving of the chest  At each feebler effort at respiration his arms sank lower  and his legs hung more relaxed  until at last  straight and lank he dangled  swayed to and fro by the wind  It was a moment of deep solemnity  and suggestive of thoughts that make the bosom swell  The field of execution was a rising ground  and commanded the outstretching valley from mountain to mountain  and their still grandeur gave sublimity to the outline  while it so chanced that white clouds resting upon them  gave them the appearance that reminded more than one of us of the snow peaks of the Alps  Before us was the greatest array of disciplined forces ever seen in Virginia  infantry  cavalry and artillery combined  composed of the old Commonwealth s noblest sons  and commanded by her best officers  and the great canopy of the sky overarching all  came to add its sublimity ever present  but only realized when other great things are occurring beneath each  But the moral of the scene was its grand point  A sovereign state had been assailed  and she had uttered but a hint  and her sons had hastened to show that they were ready to defend her  Law had been violated by actual murder and attempted treason  and that gibbet was erected by law  and to uphold law was this military force assembled  But  greater still God s Holy Law and righteous Providence was vindicated   Thou shalt not kill   Whoso sheddeth man s blood  by man shall his blood be shed  And here the gray haired man of violence meets his fate  after he has seen his two sons cut down before him  in the same career of violence into which he had introduced them  So perish all such enemies of Virginia  All such enemies of the Union  All such foes of the human race  So I felt  and so I said  with solemnity and without one shade of animosity  as I turned to break the silence  to those around me  Yet  the mystery was awful  to see the human form thus treated by men  to see life suddenly stopped in its current  and to ask one s self the question without answer And what then  In all that array there was not  I suppose  one throb of sympathy for the offender  All felt in the depths of their hearts that it was right  On the other hand  there was not one single word or gesture of exultation or of insult  From the beginning to the end  all was marked by the most absolute decorum and solemnity  There was no military music  no saluting by troops as they passed one another  nor anything done for show  The criminal hung upon the gallows for nearly forty minutes  and after being examined by a whole staff of surgeons  was deposited in a neat coffin to be delivered to his friends  and transported to Harper s Ferry  where his wife awaited it  She came in company with two persons to see her husband last night  and returned to Harper s Ferry this morning  She is described by those who saw her as a very large  masculine woman  of absolute composure of manner  The officers who witnessed their meeting in the jail said they met as if nothing unusual had taken place  and had a comfortable supper together  Brown would not have the assistance of any Minister in jail during his last days  nor their presence with him on the scaffold  In going from prison to the place of execution  he said very little  only assuring those who were with him that he had no fear  nor had he at any time in his life  known what fear was  When he entered the gate of the enclosure  he expressed his admiration of the beauty of the surrounding country  and pointing to different residences  asked who were the owners of them  There was a very small crowd to witness the execution  Governor Wise and General Taliaferro had both issued proclamations exhorting the citizens to remain at home and guard their property  and warned them of possible danger  The train on the Winchester Railroad had been stopped from carrying passengers  and even passengers on the Baltimore Rairoad were subjected to examination and detention  An arrangement was made to divide the expected crowed into recognized citizens  and those not recognized  to require the former to go to the right  and the latter to the left  Of the latter there was not a single one  it was told last night there were not in Charles Town ten persons besides citizens and military  There is but one opinion as to the completeness of the arrangements made on the occasion  and the absolute success with which they were carried out  I have said something about the striking effect of the pageant as a pageant  but the excellence of it was that everything was arranged solely with the view of efficiency  and not for effect upon the eye  Had it been intended as a mere spectacle  it could not have been made more imposing  or had actual need occurred  it was the best possible arrangement  You may be inclined to ask was all this necessary  I have not time to enter upon the question now  Governor Wise thought it necessary  and he said he had reliable information  The responsibility of calling out the force rests with him  It only remained for those under his orders to dispose the force in the best manner  That this was done is unquestionable  and  whatever credit is due for it  may fairly be claimed by those who accomplished it Archives Home Digital Collections Archives Online Catalog Quick Info  FAQs

the gate of the enclosure  he expressed his admiration of the beauty of the surrounding country  and pointing to different residences  asked who were the owners of them  There was a very small crowd to witness the execution  Governor Wise and General Taliaferro had both issued proclamations exhorting the citizens to remain at home and guard their property  and warned them of possible danger  The train on the Winchester Railroad had been stopped from carrying passengers  and even passengers on the Baltimore Rairoad were subjected to examination and detention  An arrangement was made to divide the expected crowed into recognized citizens  and those not recognized  to require the former to go to the right  and the latter to the left  Of the latter there was not a single one  it was told last night there were not in Charles Town ten persons besides citizens and military  There is but one opinion as to the completeness of the arrangements made on the occasion  and the absolute success with which they were carried out  I have said something about the striking effect of the pageant as a pageant  but the excellence of it was that everything was arranged solely with the view of efficiency

Military Institute and one of its first faculty members  This letter  written to his wife  was published in the Lexington  VA  Gazette  December 15  1859  More about this topic About this document More about this topic  Full Text Full Text  Charles Town  Dec  2  1859 The execution is over  we have just returned from the field and I sit down to give you some account of it  The weather was very favorable  the sky was a little overcast  with a gentle haze in the atmosphere that softened without obscuring the magnificent prospect afforded here Between eight and nine o clock  the troops began to put themselves in motion to occupy the positions assigned to them on the field  as designated on the plan I send you  To Col  Smith had been assigned the superintendence of the execution  and he and his staff were the only mounted officers on the ground  until the Major General and his staff appeared  By ten o clock all was arranged  The general effect was most imposing  and  at the same time  picturesque The cadets were immediately in rear of the gallows with a howitzer on the right and left  a little behind  so as to sweep the field  They were uniformed in red flannel shirts  which gave them a gay  dashing  Zouave look  and was exceedingly becoming  especially at the Battery  They were flanked obliquely by two corps  the Richmond Grays  Greys  and Company F  which if inferior in appearance to the cadets  were superior to any other company I ever saw outside of the regular army  Other companies were distributed over the field  amounting in all to about 800 men  The military force was about 1 500 The whole enclosure was lined by cavalry troops posted as sentinels  with their officers one on a peerless black horse  and another on a remarkable looking white horse  continually dashing round the enclosure  Outside this enclosure were other companies acting as rangers and scouts  The jail was guarded by several companies of infantry  an pieces of artillery were put in position for its defense Shortly before eleven o clock the prisoner was taken from the jail  and the funeral cortege was put in motion  First came three companies  then the criminal s wagon  drawn by two large white horses  John Brown was seated on his coffin  accompanied by the sheriff and two other persons  The wagon drove to the foot of the gallows  and Brown descended with alacrity and without assistance  and ascended the steep steps to the platform  His demeanor was intrepid  without being braggart  He made no speech  whether he desired to make one or not  I do not know  Had he desired it  it would not have been permitted  Any speech of his must  of necessity  have been unlawful  and as being directed against the peace and dignity of the Commonwealth  and as such could not be allowed by those who were then engaged in the most solemn and extreme vindication of law His manner was without trepidation  but his countenance was not free from concern  and it seemed to me to have a little cast of wildness  He stood upon the scaffold but a short time  giving brief adieus to those about him  when he was properly pinioned  the white cap drawn over his face  the noose adjusted and attached to the hook above  and he was moved blindfold a few steps forward  It was curious to note how the instincts of nature operated to make him careful in putting his feet as if afraid he would walk off the scaffold  The man who stood unblanched on the brink of eternity was afraid of falling a few feet to the ground He was now all ready  The sheriff asked him if he should give him a private signal before the fatal moment  He replied in a voice that seemed to me unnaturally natural  so composed was its tone  and so distinct its articulation  that  it did not matter to him  if only they would not keep him too long waiting  He was kept waiting  however  The troops that had formed his escort had to be put into their position  and while this was going on  he stood for some ten or fifteen minutes blindfold  the rope around his neck  and his feet on the treacherous platform  expecting instantly the fatal act  But he stood for this comparatively long time upright as a soldier in position  and motionless I was close to him  and watched him narrowly  to see if I could perceive any signs of shrinking or trembling in his person  but there was none  Once I thought I saw his knees tremble  but it was only the wind blowing his loose trousers  His firmness was subjected to still further trial by hearing Colonel Smith announce to the sheriff   We are all ready  Mr  Campbell  The sheriff did not hear  or did not comprehend  and in a louder tone the same announcement was made  But the culprit still stood ready until the sheriff  descending the flight of steps  with a well directed blow of a sharp hatchet  severed the rope that held up the trap door  which instantly sank beneath him  and he fell about three feet  and the man of strong and bloody hand  of fierce passions  of iron will  of wonderful vicissitudes  the terrible partisan of Kansas  the capturer of the United States Arsenal at Harper s Ferry  the would be Catiline of the South  the demi god of the abolitionists  the man execrated and lauded  damned and prayed for  the man who in his motives  his means  his plans  and his successes  must ever be a wonder  a puzzle  and a mystery John Brown was hanging between heaven and earth There was profound stillness during the time his struggles continued  growing feebler and feebler at each abortive attempt to breathe  He knees were scarcely bent  his arms were drawn up to a right angle at the elbow  with the hands clenched  but there was no writhing of the body  no violent heaving of the chest  At each feebler effort at respiration his arms sank lower  and his legs hung more relaxed  until at last  straight and lank he dangled  swayed to and fro by the wind It was a moment of deep solemnity  and suggestive of thoughts that make the bosom swell  The field of execution was a rising ground  and commanded the outstretching valley from mountain to mountain  and their still grandeur gave sublimity to the outline  while it so chanced that white clouds resting upon them  gave them the appearance that reminded more than one of us of the snow peaks of the Alps  Before us was the greatest array of disciplined forces ever seen in Virginia  infantry  cavalry and artillery combined  composed of the old Commonwealth s noblest sons  and commanded by her best officers  and the great canopy of the sky overarching all  came to add its sublimity ever present  but only realized when other great things are occurring beneath each But the moral of the scene was its grand point  A sovereign state had been assailed  and she had uttered but a hint  and her sons had hastened to show that they were ready to defend her  Law had been violated by actual murder and attempted treason  and that gibbet was erected by law  and to uphold law was this military force assembled  But  greater still God s Holy Law and righteous Providence was vindicated   Thou shalt not kill   Whoso sheddeth man s blood  by man shall his blood be shed  And here the gray haired man of violence meets his fate  after he has seen his two sons cut down before him  in the same career of violence into which he had introduced them  So perish all such enemies of Virginia  All such enemies of the Union  All such foes of the human race  So I felt  and so I said  with solemnity and without one shade of animosity  as I turned to break the silence  to those around me  Yet  the mystery was awful  to see the human form thus treated by men  to see life suddenly stopped in its current  and to ask one s self the question without answer And what then In all that array there was not  I suppose  one throb of sympathy for the offender  All felt in the depths of their hearts that it was right  On the other hand  there was not one single word or gesture of exultation or of insult  From the beginning to the end  all was marked by the most absolute decorum and solemnity  There was no military music  no saluting by troops as they passed one another  nor anything done for show  The criminal hung upon the gallows for nearly forty minutes  and after being examined by a whole staff of surgeons  was deposited in a neat coffin to be delivered to his friends  and transported to Harper s Ferry  where his wife awaited it  She came in company with two persons to see her husband last night  and returned to Harper s Ferry this morning  She is described by those who saw her as a very large  masculine woman  of absolute composure of manner  The officers who witnessed their meeting in the jail said they met as if nothing unusual had taken place  and had a comfortable supper together Brown would not have the assistance of any Minister in jail during his last days  nor their presence with him on the scaffold  In going from prison to the place of execution  he said very little  only assuring those who were with him that he had no fear  nor had he at any time in his life  known what fear was  When he entered the gate of the enclosure  he
