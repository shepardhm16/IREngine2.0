2013   More than 100 cadets and local community members attended a talk and book signing last month by Eric Greitens  CEO of The Mission Continues and author of The Heart and the Fist  The Education of a Humanitarian  the Making of a Navy SEAL  Greitens  visit to VMI was sponsored by the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethic s Leadership Book Program  and select members of the program joined Greitens for dinner in Crozet Hall before the talk  Greitens  unique experience as a Rhodes Scholar  humanitarian relief worker  and Navy SEAL resonated with the VMI audience   He epitomizes the Institute ideal of a well educated  honorable  citizen soldier  noted Col  David Miller  the center s interim director  Deployed three times during the war on terror  Greitens used his combat pay from a deployment to Iraq to start The Mission Continues in 2007  The organization challenges veterans who served after the terrorist attacks of Sept  11  2001  to give back to their communities   One of the things that I ve noticed in working with hundreds of veterans around the country is that when they come home they often face a new front line  said Greitens   When you start to reflect for a minute what you start to recognize is that everyone has a front line in their life  Describing the front line as the place where one comes in contact with hardship  pain  and suffering  Greitens challenged cadets to reflect on their own front lines and the front lines of those in their families and communities   We all have to deal with the front line in our life  It s also the case that the way that we serve  the way that we lead  the way that we react to those things on the front line will determine who we will be and whether or not we achieve a victory in our own lives  By offering veterans fellowships requiring 20 hours of service per week for 26 weeks at local nonprofit organizations  as well as group community service projects with which to become involved  The Mission Continues provides opportunities for them to explore new areas of interest and use their skills to serve others in a new way  It can be frightening  Greitens noted  for veterans to have to adjust their lives in new ways when they return from a deployment  but he has found that asking them to think back on their first few weeks in the military helps them remember that they have already made a large lifestyle change at least once before   We remind them that they are absolutely capable of doing this again here at home  For Philip Pryor  14  Leadership Book Program cadet in charge  this emphasis on serving veterans by helping them serve was the most thought provoking part of Greitens  presentation   Rather than to simply help out monetarily with wounded veterans returning from overseas   The Mission Continues  instead challenges them to continue to serve their community in a number of ways  said Pryor   I myself had never really thought about how veterans need more than just money  but also the support of their local communities as well  Nathan Webster  15  assistant CIC  viewed the visit and presentation as another success for the Leadership Book Program  which is open to all cadets  faculty  and staff   Reading is a common trait among the most influential leaders  noted Webster   Harry Truman  thirty third president of the United States  claimed that  not all readers are leaders  but all leaders are readers   Capt  Beth Stefanik  Center for Leadership and Ethics  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX
