 21  2015   Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics at Virginia Military Institute  has been selected to receive a 2016 Outstanding Faculty Award by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia  David  who has been teaching at VMI since 2011  was one of two recipients statewide to receive the Rising Star Award  an honor bestowed on faculty members showing extraordinary promise at the beginning of their academic careers  Selection for the Rising Star Award is based on performance in four areas  teaching  discovery  integration of knowledge  and service  All of the honorees will be recognized at an awards ceremony and luncheon to be held at the Jefferson Hotel in Richmond in February 2016  Just prior to that ceremony  the honorees will be introduced on the floor of the General Assembly  As a teacher  David has received stellar evaluations  Cadets in his classes have praised him for his willingness to help them find answers without giving too much assistance  as well as his deep knowledge of the subject matter and lively  engaging manner in the classroom  David has also developed a new class in mathematical modeling  and is currently working with VMI s
