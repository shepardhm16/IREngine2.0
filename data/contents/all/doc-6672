Physics   Astronomy   Ultrashort Pulse Optics Laboratory Ultrashort Pulse Optics Laboratory In the May of 2013  a collaborative research venture between Dr  Stacey K  Vargas  professor  Department of Physics and Astronomy and Tom Chaffee  CEO of Attochron  LLC lead to the creation of the VMI Ultrashort Pulse  USP  Optics Laboratory in the Department of Physics and Astronomy  Research In collaboration with scientists from Attochron  the VMI research team lead by Dr  Vargas is creating a revolutionary point to point optical wireless telecommunications link  The novel technology uses an ultrashort pulse laser  USPL  as the signal carrier in a free space optics system  FSO  The UPSL FSO  link has the potential to provide signal speeds as fast as 10Gbps  The USPL FSO system is anticipated to remain available over distances of 1 25 kilometers  km  or greater making it an ideal option for cell tower backhaul  enterprise access  and similar last mile customers  Experimental Set up In addition to a laboratory tabletop experimental set up  two mock cell tower links have been established to test the UPSL link in free space  one which is 300 meters between Mallory Hall and the stadium press box and the other which is 700 meters between Mallory Hall and a rooftop in downtown Lexington  A longer link between VMI and downtown Lexington is being established  Weather Station A weather station consisting of a fog monitor  laser precipitation monitor and a Davis weather station has been created for the project  All equipment is mounted on the rooftop of Mallory Hall  The University Corporation for Atmospheric Research loaned the fog monitor to VMI for the research  Dr  Tim Moore  associate professor  Department of Civil Engineering  was in charge of mounting the equipment and is supervising the weather station operation  Interfacing and Data Loggins Dr  Merce Brooke  associate professor  Department of Physics and Astronomy is in charge of interfacing the weather station equipment as well as other electronic equipment  He is also working on the data logging for the project  Lasers Calmar Laser with custom design by Attochron and VMI  Gigahertz
