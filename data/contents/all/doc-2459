History   Bestowing and Receiving Knowledge Bestowing and Receiving Knowledge Megan Scheetz  14 understands the value of study abroad  having used the past two summers to travel to India as well as within the U S  to inform her research into the complex relationship among the U S  India  and Pakistan  Scheetz was among approximately 20 cadets who gave presentations on their senior theses during Honors Week  March 21 28  offering the VMI community insight into diverse topics including sustainability  aerodynamics  and foreign policy  Scheetz s presentation on her project concerning America s policies toward India and Pakistan emphasized economic stability as a platform for building political cooperation  Scheetz has visited India twice  first for a study abroad trip in 2012 and again last summer to teach English in Delhi at the Karmapa International Buddhist Institute   Looking at the India Pakistan relationship  it s so complex that learning from books and articles is not enough to fully understand the situation there  said Scheetz  Scheetz has worked with experts in both the U S  and India to better understand this complex relationship   When I went to India  I met with a political counselor at the U S  embassy in New Delhi  so I talked with him about my thesis and national security  said Scheetz   It was a good summer  I learned a lot  Last summer  Scheetz also took part in an internship at the U S  Marine Corps University at Quantico  where she studied with Dr  Amin Tarzi  director of Middle East studies   I worked with him over the summer for five weeks  said Scheetz   When I was with him  we decided on U S  foreign policy towards India and Pakistan for my research  Continuing her research this year  Scheetz enlisted the help of VMI faculty members including her mentor  associate professor of history Lt  Col  Eric Osborne  and international studies professor Brig  Gen  Charles Brower IV  international studies instructor Vera Heuer  and librarians at VMI who helped her find sources   When I taught English in India  I learned from the Buddhist monks that if someone has knowledge and they give that knowledge to someone else  that s the greatest gift you can bestow  Scheetz said during her presentation   So I appreciate it so much that you all helped offer this knowledge to me  Scheetz is graduating with a major in history and a minor in national security  and is planning to travel to China to teach English for 10 months starting in August   Since I was a kid I ve liked learning about other countries    said Scheetz   Studying abroad  especially in developing countries  really helps you to grow  By  John Robertson IV IR   May 2014 Home   Academics   Areas of Study   Arts   Humanities   History   Bestowing and
