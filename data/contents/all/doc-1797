2014  The proposed research is already in progress  Five cultivated varieties of soybean  Glycine max  were grown in Summer 2011 in the Maury Brooke Hall greenhouse and in a local field site to determine which variety of soybean produces the ideal composition of stem cell wall chemicals  cellulose  hemicellulose  and lignin  to produce biofuel through high temperature combustion and gasification  Once identified  this cultivar will be genetically enhanced to produce the optimal concentration of cellulose  the most efficient biofuel chemical  while also decreasing nitrogen  Since most dried plant matter is enriched in nitrogen  which produces nitrogen oxide gases  NOx  that contribute to smog and acid rain when combusted  Maj  Alerding is investigating how to insert a chimeric gene into the soybean genome to allow the plant to dump excess nitrogen into the leaves before harvest  The goal is to produce a genetically modified  superplant  that will not only produce high yielding biofuels but will return the limiting growth nutrient   nitrogen   to the soil  Maj  Alerding advises and works closely with Cadet Matthew Waalkes  13 on this project  results of which will culminate in his Institute Honors thesis and a research publication  Cadet Waalkes will present results from his summer research in the Biology Student Colloquium during Dean s Hour on Monday  January

VMI to train the next generation of clean energy leaders through the establishment of VMI CLEAR  Clean Energy and Air Workforce Development Program  In support of their new program  Majs  Alerding
