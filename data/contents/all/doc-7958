more of the sky onto film of a given size  Plate scale  in arcseconds mm  and the amount of the sky shown on your image depends only on the focal length of the telescope    For photographs of nebulae and galaxies  the focal ratio of the telescope is very important  The brightness of stars  point sources  is proportional to D2  the Diameter of the telescope  and D2 is proportional to the collecting area  pi R2  However  the brightness of a nebula is proportional to D2 FL2 since the image of the nebula is also spread out over x and y dimensions by an amount proportional to the focal length  FL    Reflecting telescopes  with their secondary mirror  generally with mirror supports  often produce  diffraction spikes  around star images  While not aesthetically objectionable  it is true that any obstructions can degrade the image a little  Refractors don t suffer from this problem Are you interested in photographing a very faint object  Perhaps a faint Cepheid variable star  A large reflector will collect a lot more light  and the resulting small field of view is not a problem  Are you interested in a moderately wide field  say enough to capture the Orion nebula  Then a short focal length telescope  and correspondingly smaller plate scale  will get more of the sky onto film of a given size  Plate scale  in arcseconds mm  and the amount of the sky shown on your image depends only on the

reflectors for a quality image  both from the standpoint of lens mirror quality and precision optical mountings  and lack of central obscurations  Equally important in a choice of telescope type is the focal length and the resulting field of view VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni VMI Foundation VMI Foundation Keydet Club Keydet Club
