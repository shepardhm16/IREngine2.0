Welcome Any Question Welcome January 18  2013 in Academic  Faculty and Staff  Stories  by Kate When VMI Arabic professor Mohamed Taifi walks into his classroom  his personal warmth and his enthusiasm for his subject begin a process that leads to much more than explanations of grammar and lessons in deciphering an unfamiliar script  Taifi nurtures a relationship that helps cadets in these small classes gain fluencyin a difficult language and gain new understandings about a culture many will experience in their future careers  Taifi  who also speaks fluent French  brings the culture of his native Morocco into the classroom with him  often aiding conversations with gesture and metaphor  His dramatic presentation encourages connection with his students  And so do the jokes they tell  in Arabic  around the Arabic table Taifi and his colleagues lead in the dining hall  There  the conversation may shift back to English and again to Arabic as professors and cadets share experiences from time spent abroad and discuss cultural issues  The connection Taifi forms with cadets is a lasting one  Most cadets who begin studying the Arabic language proceed through all four levels offered by VMI and continue to correspond with Taifi  often in Arabic  after they graduate  Many also participate in the summer home stay study abroad program in Morocco Taifi directs  Some go twice  The students stay with Moroccan families and take classes four hours a day at the Central Arabic Language Institute in Fez  Taifi takes the cadets on weekend trips to the imperial cities and spends a weekend with them in the desert  When they return  the cadets skip two semesters of Arabic  And they find their lives change as misconceptions about Arabic cultures fall away   Students look up to me as a role model  said Taifi  who writes articles in Arabic and novels in French  He shares his interests with cadets  inviting them to sample Moroccan food in meals at his house and encouraging language acquisition and culture education through role playing exercises in the classroom  And in his classroom  any kind of question is welcome   If you have enough experience  then you predict their difficulties  said Taifi   and teach accordingly  When we love a job  then we do it with pleasure  Mohamed Taifi Professor  Modern Languages and Cultures Ph D   Doctorat d Etat Es Lettres  Aix

Twitter Share on Google  Share on Linkedin Share on Tumblr Share on Reddit Share by Mail      Any Question Welcome January 18  2013 in Academic  Faculty and Staff  Stories  by Kate When VMI Arabic professor Mohamed Taifi walks into his classroom  his personal warmth and his enthusiasm for his subject begin a process that leads to much more than explanations of grammar and lessons in deciphering an unfamiliar script  Taifi nurtures a relationship that helps cadets in these small classes gain fluencyin a difficult language and gain new understandings about a culture many will experience in their future careers  Taifi  who also speaks fluent French  brings the culture of his native Morocco into the classroom with him  often aiding conversations with gesture and metaphor  His dramatic presentation encourages connection with his students  And so do the jokes they tell  in Arabic  around the Arabic table Taifi and his colleagues lead in the dining hall  There  the conversation may shift back to English and again to Arabic as professors and cadets share experiences from time spent abroad and discuss cultural issues  The connection Taifi forms with cadets is a lasting one  Most cadets who begin studying the Arabic language proceed through all four levels offered by VMI and continue to correspond with Taifi  often in Arabic  after they graduate  Many also participate in the summer home stay study abroad program in Morocco Taifi directs  Some go twice  The students stay with Moroccan families and take classes four hours a day at the Central Arabic Language Institute in Fez  Taifi takes the cadets on weekend trips to the imperial cities and spends a weekend with them in the desert  When they return  the cadets skip two semesters of Arabic  And they find their lives change as misconceptions about Arabic cultures fall away   Students look up to me as a role model  said Taifi  who writes articles in Arabic and novels in French  He shares his interests with cadets  inviting them to sample Moroccan food in meals at his house and encouraging language acquisition and culture education through role playing exercises in the classroom  And in his classroom  any kind of question is welcome   If you have enough experience  then you predict their difficulties  said Taifi   and teach accordingly  When we love a job  then we do it with pleasure  Mohamed Taifi
