Professor Said  Can Be Full of New Meaning LEXINGTON  Va  Jan  26  2015  History is not a story  Dr  Edward L  Ayers  president of the University of Richmond  made that surprising and somewhat counterintuitive claim in a speech given to the VMI Corps of Cadets  faculty  and community members earlier today in Cameron Hall  Ayers  appearance at VMI was part of the H B  Johnson Jr   26 Distinguished Lecture Series  Ayers  a noted historian and co host of Back Story  a nationally syndicated radio show that ties history to the present day  spoke on  The Shape of the Civil War  That shape  he argued  is open to interpretation  even by those who believe they understand what happened in the United States between 1860 and 1865   People think that if they memorize all of the battles and all of the generals  then they ve figured out the Civil War  Ayers noted   No one  abolitionist or secessionist or enslaved person  could have imagined the Civil War that actually occurred  The war that actually occurred  he explained  bears scant resemblance to the conflict that many people imagine  To illustrate his point  Ayers showed an complex chart  similar to a subway system map  which purports to show the entire Civil War in one sweeping glance  The chart  entitled  History of the Civil War in the United States  was produced in 1897  and is now part of the collection of the Library of Congress  Ayers noted that in producing the chart  its creator  Arthur Hotchkiss Sciafe  thought that by presenting all of the extant information about the war visually  he could end the bickering over its causes and outcomes  Ayers read a quote from Sciafe in which the chart creator noted that   the Civil War s  very nearness to ourselves tends to obscure our view  Ayers  though  noted that the human tendency to create a story means that some information is allowed in   that which fits the narrative frame of the teller   while information that doesn t fit the frame is discarded   Narratives are hard wired into our brains  the university president acknowledged   But here s the problem    the shape of something the scale of a war can only be seen when the war is finished  But when we go back  the shape seems like what the war was    The Civil War could have assumed many shapes  To illustrate his point  Ayers noted that many people think that the Battle of Gettysburg  a Union victory in April 1863  was the turning point of the war  Ayers  though  argued that the true turning point that brought victory to the Union was the election of 1864   but this event doesn t fit the narrative because it wasn t a battle  Likewise  there is a popular misconception that all of the time in a war is spent fighting   We don t respect a calendar in the way we respect a map  Ayers said   In war  the great majority of the time of soldiers is not in a big battle  Gesturing to the chart  Ayers pointed out that  wars are won and lost in the time when it looks like nothing is happening  A further example  the speaker noted  is the tendency for students to focus on the battles fought in Virginia and neighboring states  while ignoring those fought in the states bordering the Mississippi River  even though the western battles covered a much larger geographic area than those in the East   We can t tell two stories at the same time in our heads  Ayers said in explaining this phenomenon   We don t have the bandwidth to see what s going on  At the same time  Ayers said  there is a tendency to ignore the hundreds or even thousands of minor skirmishes that took place during the Civil War  represented by red dots on Sciafe s chart  even though these vastly outnumbered the big battles   This is the Civil War that we don t really tell  said Ayers   The war was about the will to fight  He explained that lost in the sweep of history   and narrative   has been the dogged determination of each side to keep fighting until the other side was exhausted and thus ready to capitulate   The war has to be understood in relation to what s happening off this chart  said Ayers  who was awarded the National Professor of the Year from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 2003  Those off the chart events mentioned by Ayers include not only the election of 1864 and the morale issue that kept each side pressing the other toward exhaustion  but also the fact that in the days before motorized transportation  major battles could only be fought when the weather permitted travel  France and England could have decided to support the Confederacy as well  said Ayers  which might have led to a different outcome   Why am I in favor of making history harder to understand  asked Ayers rhetorically   Even something apparently memorized and straightforward as the American Civil War  that happened right here where we are  is full of mystery  full of things to discover  he continued   It s full of meanings for ourselves  It can talk to us more if we open ourselves to its new possibilities  History  Ayers concluded  is not a set of dry facts in a dusty tome  to be dreaded by successive generations of students  Declared Ayers   History is the mystery of all things that humans have ever experienced   Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety
