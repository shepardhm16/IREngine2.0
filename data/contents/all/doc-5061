spouses  and friends  Good evening   the Institute welcomes you back to VMI  It s been 29 years since 423 of you signed the Matriculation Book and became VMI cadets  It was August 20  1986  a dark and gloomy day according to reports  and the beginning of VMI s 147th year  It was also the start of a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  At the end of that strenuous week  the Old Corps returned and you were introduced to the Rat Line by the RDC  From that day forward  you were known to the rest of the Corps as  The Mass of 1987  It would be some very long months of testing before you became  The Fourth Class  or the  Class of 1990  As I researched the archives  the VMI recorded history of your Class was revealing  Perhaps it sounded good to you when the upperclassmen announced that you would be having a  Big Party  But the reality was quite different  Your historian  Andy England  described the event as follows   Our big party was like nothing any other school could or would want to imagine  In place of alcohol  we had sweat  In place of women  we had a bunch of mean upperclassmen  In place of real music we had motivational music  All of this was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  COL David V  Harbach  61   I was a Rat when he was a 3rd Class Corporal if that is helpful  Colonel Harbach  the last active duty Commandant at VMI  would remain until the start of your First Class year  when he was succeeded by COL William H  Dabney  Jr   61  The Superintendent when you arrived was GEN Sam S  Walker  45  who also remained until your First Class year  when he was succeeded by MG John W  Knapp  54  who had served as Dean of the Faculty  The experience of your Rat year is probably a blur to many of you  It was filled with academic classes  a chaotic orientation session at New Market  Rat Training every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon  a run up House Mountain  numerous sweat parties  stoop runs  and rifle runs  Thursday evening Pep Rallies  athletic events  and much more  Some claimed that your rat line was the hardest in a decade  Again quoting your historian   Not all that tried could make it  As our group grew smaller  the unity became more intense  A love and brotherhood between our co matriculants spread  and the true meaning of  Brother Rat  was discovered by those who stayed  Finally  on March 18  1987  you entered a week known as  Resurrection  and then successfully climbed Breakout Hill  The rat mass known as  87 plus 3  had become the  Class of 1990  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  The large number of cadets in the Corps caused over crowding in the tight barracks space  Across the Parade Ground  work was underway on a new science building  In addition  work was being done on VMI s athletic facilities  renovations to Son Read Memorial Track  a new baseball diamond at Patchin Field  new fields for soccer and lacrosse  a new football dressing room complex  and a new press box  A major change took place in the Commandant s Office and the Guard Room when a computer system was installed to replace the old practice of  signing in and signing out  on sheets of paper  This was soon to be followed by an electrical system upgrade in Barracks and the controversial introduction of new modular furniture in cadet rooms  much to the dislike of many tradition minded cadets  The fact that the plain furniture had been constructed in Virginia prisons made the furniture a little more acceptable to some diehard cadets  And  of course  this was the last year for the old  Sinks  The start of your Third Class year brought new privileges and responsibilities  For some it meant the rank of cadet corporal  and for others it meant leadership positions in cadet committees  clubs  and athletic teams  According to your historian   We were allowed to take weekends and leave post  We were able to take advantage of permits allowing us to attend mixers at other colleges  We were even allowed to have hair  You also helped to administer the Rat Line  but that system was undergoing changes that disturbed upperclassmen  Issues over the conduct of the Rat Line and Barracks governance slowly heated up and the CADET newspaper was filled with protests from Cadets and opinion polls  In your Third Class year  you discovered that VMI had a second Rat Line   the so called  Academic Rat Line  Otherwise  the year was much like most others  Barracks life  military training  parades  physical training  FTX  athletic events  Hops  Zollman s  Spanky s  and Estill s  The excitement of the start of the academic year  the Oyster Bowl in Norfolk  the drudgery of the Dark Ages  the final arrival of Spring  New Market Day  and Finals filled the year  Standing out in your memory  however  was the arrival of the  Plague  in October  when it was estimated that 80 percent of the Corps became sick  But it soon passed and by February the  woolies  were burned and many cadets headed for Spring Break  Later  Joe DiMaggio came to VMI to dedicate the new baseball diamond at Patchin Field and signed baseballs for many fans  These were trying times for most of VMI s athletic teams  but there were some notable victories that brought pride and excitement to the Corps  On another level  policies and practices of VMI were coming under serious scrutiny  Next door  Washington and Lee University went co ed  and the VMI Cadet newspaper asked   Is V M I  Next  In fact  near the end of your second class year  in April of 1989  VMI received a letter from the U S  Department of Justice asking VMI to respond to allegations of sexual discrimination over its male only admissions policy  This was the beginning of a long court battle to preserve VMI policy  which was eventually struck down by the U S  Supreme Court  This was the time  as well  that the Saturday academic schedule    Saturday Classes    was replaced with other activities  and the age old practice of forming on the bricks and marching to class with section marchers was abolished  thus saving about 10 lost minutes in each class period  In addition  a major change took place with VMI s mandatory commissioning policy  Studies of the policy by the VMI Board of Visitors continued for several years with opinions by the Corps divided for and against  The final decision  which was made in February of 1990  rescinded the mandatory commissioning policy and  thereafter  cadets would be commissioned on a voluntary basis  Early in your Second Class year  General Walker announced his retirement  He resigned in December of 1989 and was replaced by the new Superintendent  BG John W  Knapp  General Walker past away last month at his home in Pinehurst  North Carolina   a great soldier and great American  And will be buried October 12th in the USMA  West Point Cemetery  The highlight of your Second Class year was Ring Figure  an event that ranks in importance with Breakout and Graduation  Your Ring Figure took place on November 18  1988  the ring presentation ceremony took place in J  M  Hall where you were addressed by COL Charles Caudill  the very popular Chaplain to the Corps of Cadets  and COL Harbach  the honored speaker  Each of you received your ring from General Walker  That evening  the traditional Ring Figure ball was held in Cocke Hall  And  of course  your ring was painted by the cannonball committee  During your cadetship  important changes in the Corps structure and governance systems were taking place  changes that were not universally appreciated by the Corps  A third Battalion was in place consisting of Golf  Hotel  and India companies  This was done to facilitate administration  create more responsive command and control within the Corps structure  and to increase leadership positions and opportunities  Dissatisfaction over changes to the Rat Line continued until  on the 16th of November 1988  the first class announced that it had  relieved the administration of control of Barracks  by relieving the designated guard team  This action led to several months of meetings and negotiations between class leaders and administration officials  After some time  Corps leaders and Acting Superintendent MG John Knapp worked out a solution to the dispute and life returned to a semblance of normal  In January of 1989  VMI sent a contingent to the Inaugural Parade of President elect George H  W  Bush  In the wider world  all eyes were on the Soviet Union as Mikhail Gorbachev relieved the Old Guard and advocated  Glasnost  and  Peristroika  which soon led to the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War  The Academic Year 1989 1990  your First Class year  contained the 11 November celebration of VMI Sesquicentennial  150 Years of producing Citizen Soldiers  Guests from nearby colleges and a French delegation attended the ceremony  which included the official dedication of the New Science Building  It was during this year that VMI created the position of full time Commandant  Mandatory Commissioning was rescinded  the Department of Justice put VMI on notice  and VMI cadets marched in the inauguration of Governor Douglas Wilder  Virginia s first African American Governor  Governor Wilder was the speaker at your graduation on May 19  1990  Cadet Peter A  Tunnard was your Valedictorian  In the 1990 BOMB  the  closing paragraph  about your class reads   The Class of 1990 has set the standards for future classes  These standards must be upheld to keep VMI s stature undiminished  Your class then dispersed to join the legions of alumni  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post provide an enhanced environment for learning and development  Last year we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  From this vantage point  we can look back on a rich history  but we can also look forward to a bright future  Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  The Institute s future depends heavily  as it always has  upon the quality of its cadets  I am pleased to report that the entering class of New Cadets   the Class of 2019   consists of 495 outstanding men and women  Of this number  302 are in state matriculants and 193 are out of state and foreign  Men number 442 and women number 53  Forty four percent  44  of the entering class ranked in the top quarter of their high school classes and their mean SAT composite score is 1151  Of curriculum choices  155 have selected engineering  115 have selected math and science  including computer science  and the rest selected liberal arts  with International Studies leading with 74  In sum  approximately 60  Virginians   40  out of state  with greater than 50  in the STEM degrees and the GPA of 3 6  VMI continues to send educated and honorable graduates into the ranks of the alumni  into the military  and into the varied work of civil life  On 16 May  303 members of the Class of 2015 graduated  Adding graduates from other classes  the ceremony saw 324 cross the stage and receive a VMI diploma  By this early fall  greater than 50  will commission in the Armed Forces  That number is especially commendable and reinforces VMI s historic mission of producing Citizen Soldiers  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  Over the past year  have selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  son of the Commandant in the 1960s  GEN Smith completed a thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  has returned to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  Recently  two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  Money  for example  has ranked VMI second among public schools in Virginia and third among all schools in Virginia in return on investment  the amount of money a student is likely to earn with a degree minus the net cost of attending the school  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  In 2014  U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the year s Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of the past nine years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done an outstanding job with  great class  over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic director s job in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby  and power lifting   and last academic year our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges  As we start a new football season with a new head coach  Scott Wachenheim  and a staff of new and retained assistants began practices in early August with more than 90 players  including 27 incoming fourth classmen  We opened the season on 3 September very competitively against Ball State and we look forward to tomorrow s victory at Alumni Field  We are improved  The future is bright as our Coaches use VMI s adversarial educational approach to help them win  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  We have fully updated academic buildings all along Letcher avenue  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  We have secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  throughout the academic year  and also aesthetically enhance the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  Construction also continues on North Post with a new Leadership Reaction Course  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  and the goal  which was increased from the initial figure  is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  To date  we have received more than  227 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  By any measure  the Institute has been and continues to be fully engaged in meeting the challenges of the present and immediate future  We are also looking out on a 5 year horizon in order to plan our directions  activities  building  and improvements  For sure  it is a changing and challenging world  and we must insure that the Institute meets those challenges  So  as we look forward  we see  Maturing  adjusting  and completing actions from the Academic Core Curriculum and right sizing study decisions that ensure the right subjects for the future and small class rooms  The Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Reaffirmation in 2017   also known as the Ten Year Self Study and Reaccreditation  The VMI Foundation s  Comprehensive  Campaign Addressing the Rising costs of education infrastructure  and athletics   and stabilizing the budget  Sensitivity to the NCAA reorganization and the new requirements resulting from re joining the Southern Conference  Completing the Three Corps Physical Training Facilities Actioning maintenance  repair  and renovation across the Post Advancing the opportunities in Active  Guard  and Reserve Forces as regards commissioning  The environment   addressing cultural  social  technological  and legal challenges  and VMI s uniqueness  Our national reputation  continued  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Thank you for your continuing dedication to and support of the Institute  Welcome home Class of 1990  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title
