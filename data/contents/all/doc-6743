examine a copy of a blacksmith s ledger from colonial Augusta County    VMI File Photo by John Robertson IV  VMI Professors Publish Article Showing Effectiveness of Small Claims Courts in Colonial Virginia LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  14  2015   An interdisciplinary study recently published by three Virginia Military Institute professors shows that courtrooms served the colonial Virginia frontier well in enforcing credit contracts  The article   When Good Little Debts Went Bad Civil Litigation on the Virginia Frontier  1745 1755  was published in the Summer 2015 issue of The Journal of Interdisciplinary History  Col  Tinni Sen  Col  Turk McCleskey  and Col  Atin Basuchoudhary teamed up in an unusual collaboration  Sen and Basuchoudhary are economists who mostly work on 21st century questions  and McCleskey is a colonial American historian  The research focused on Augusta County  which at that time encompassed much of what is now West Virginia  plus western and southwest Virginia  The land included Rockbridge County  which was formed from Augusta and Botetourt counties in 1778  The essay is based on court records of almost 1 400 lawsuits to recover relatively modest sums   Daily life in colonial America generated lots of small debts  McCleskey explained People had little cash  so they kept running tabs of what they owed each other Often the debts were recorded on nothing more than tiny  fragile scraps of paper  fortunately  many of those scraps survive at the Augusta County courthouse in Staunton  Based on the available records  the authors found that despite the rough and ready reputation of frontier America  colonial Virginians west of the Blue Ridge fairly enforced legitimate credit contracts Parties to lawsuits therefore settled their disputes in court  not privately  which is an essential process for socio economic stability  During the course of the work  McCleskey examined 1 378 cases and amassed a database of more than 10 000 observations  which Sen and Basuchoudhary analyzed  Work on the project began almost 20 years ago  with the initial data for the essay collected in part by then cadet Christopher Bowers  97   Few such databases exist for other colonial American locales   Economists rarely get a chance to work with original data  Sen remarked   so this was a unique opportunity I really enjoyed the interdisciplinary nature of the research project We talk a lot about the virtues of a  liberal arts education  I experienced that firsthand with this project  Basuchoudhary liked the fact that the team s findings weren t just antiquarian curiosities These findings about colonial Virginia have important implications for modern problems  Basuchoudhary commented  He continued   We demonstrated how a reliable  fair rule of law reinforced social stability in a remote region far from civil authority and close to the threat of war That s one of the key problems in modern day crises how to establish enforceable contracts in insecure environments   Plus  we got to cite the work of Chap Michie  15  who ran our robustness checks with a complicated mathematical tool called  neural networks How cool is it that a cadet graduates and gets cited in a major scholarly journal  all in the same month  The Journal of Interdisciplinary History is a top tier journal that employs the methods and insights of multiple disciplines in the study of past times to bring a historical perspective to those other disciplines The project was supported by grants in aid of research and by a Wachmeister Faculty Development

Showing Effectiveness of Small Claims Courts in Colonial Virginia LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  14  2015   An interdisciplinary study recently published by three Virginia Military Institute professors shows that courtrooms served the colonial Virginia frontier well in enforcing credit contracts  The article   When Good Little Debts Went Bad Civil Litigation on the Virginia Frontier  1745 1755  was published in the Summer 2015 issue of The Journal of Interdisciplinary History  Col  Tinni Sen  Col  Turk McCleskey  and Col  Atin Basuchoudhary teamed up in an unusual collaboration  Sen and Basuchoudhary are economists who mostly work on 21st century questions  and McCleskey is a colonial American historian  The research focused on Augusta County  which at that time encompassed much of what is now West Virginia  plus western and southwest Virginia  The land included Rockbridge County  which was formed from Augusta and Botetourt counties in 1778  The essay is based on court records of almost 1 400 lawsuits to recover relatively modest sums   Daily life in colonial America generated lots of small debts  McCleskey explained People had little cash  so they kept running tabs of what they owed each other Often the debts were recorded on nothing more than tiny  fragile scraps of paper  fortunately  many of those scraps survive at the Augusta County courthouse in Staunton  Based on the available records  the authors found that despite the rough and ready reputation of frontier America  colonial Virginians west of the Blue Ridge fairly enforced legitimate credit contracts Parties to lawsuits therefore settled their disputes in court  not privately  which is an essential process for socio economic stability  During the course of the work  McCleskey examined 1 378 cases and amassed a database of more than 10 000 observations  which Sen and Basuchoudhary analyzed  Work on the project began almost 20 years ago  with the initial data for the essay collected in part by then cadet Christopher Bowers  97   Few such databases exist for other colonial American locales   Economists rarely get a chance to work with original data  Sen remarked   so this was a unique opportunity I really enjoyed the interdisciplinary nature of the research project We talk a lot about the virtues of a  liberal arts education  I experienced that firsthand with this project  Basuchoudhary liked the fact that the team s findings weren t just antiquarian curiosities These findings about colonial Virginia have important implications for modern problems  Basuchoudhary commented  He continued   We demonstrated how a reliable  fair rule of law reinforced social stability in a remote region far from civil authority and close to the threat of war That s one of the key problems in modern day crises how to establish enforceable contracts in insecure environments   Plus  we got to cite the work of Chap Michie  15  who ran our robustness checks with a complicated mathematical tool called  neural networks How cool is it that a cadet graduates and gets cited in a major scholarly journal  all in the same month  The Journal of Interdisciplinary History is a top tier journal that employs the methods and insights of multiple disciplines in the study of past times to bring a historical perspective to those other disciplines The project was supported by grants in aid of research and by a
