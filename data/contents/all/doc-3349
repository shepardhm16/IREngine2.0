point in the storied history of Sounding Brass  VMI s first cadet run journal for literature and the arts  As we begin this new chapter  we believe it is important to honor the traditions of Sounding Brass  and to reflect on its legacy as a vital platform for creative expression  The first editors of Sounding Brass wrote of the uncertainty of their undertaking  by no means was the journal s success assured  They envisioned a forum in which all members of the Corps might have their voices heard  and the years of cadet writing  and later  visual art  that followed have answered their prophetic call resoundingly  Since the first issue in 1966  Sounding Brass has served as a place for cadets to ply their creative talents  opening small windows onto their everyday lives and reflecting their perspectives on their contemporary concerns  including war  social movements  and an ever changing Institute  The new title  Cadence  honors both the regimented call and response work song  so familiar to cadets from their daily lives  as well as the term in its more poetic context  indicating the rhythmic unfolding of sounds and words  Cadence represents the best of these two worlds  a beauty ceaselessly forged from the everyday experiences of cadets at Virginia Military Institute   From the Editors Editorial Staff Positions Available                         Application
