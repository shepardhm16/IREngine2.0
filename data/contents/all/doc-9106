VMIne VMIne  Seismic Communication  Home Research Teaching Student Pages Advising Personal We have developed an underground transmitter and portable topside receiver that allows trapped miners to communicate topside in the event of a mine collapse  When activated  the transmitter continually transduces a seismic signal into the ground  The receiver collects and processes the ground signal  The presence of a valid signal indicates survivors  and the frequency of the signal indicates their position  The system has been tested in both caverns and mines  and in less than a minute can provide a strong signal through over 1000  of vertical rock  and over half a mile horizontally  Background Your browser does not support HTML5 video playback  The concept is relatively simple  although a mass of rock will block radio communication  deep sounds travel easily through dense objects just as the booming bass from a car with its windows rolled up can be coupled through the car  road  and into your nearby car when stopped at a light  We coupled this with a mathematical equivalent of a tuned fork receiver  One tuning fork  when struck  will excite another nearby tuning fork if they the tines are the same length  The trouble is that when transmitting sound through a thousand feet of rock  random noise from a nearby leaf falling on the ground will be many times stronger than the signal you are trying to receive  We use a mathematical method called Fourier Transforms that in effect let us create several thousand distinctly tuned forks  each capable of resolving differences in pitch of less than one one hundredth of a Hertz  At the frequencies we re using  roughly two octaves below middle C  that s less than one four thousandth of the difference between a the smallest musical scale step   far smaller than anything audible or mechanically tunable  At the left is an example of a precisely frequency locked signal emerging from the noise floor and becoming clearly identifiable after about a 15 seconds  The signal in this example is about 100 000 times smaller than the surrounding noise  it is only because the receiver is mathematically tuned to resonate at precisely the send frequency and no other that the signal can be observed  Your browser does not support HTML5 video playback  The transmitter is a modified bass speaker  This is the second generation model and much easier to visualize than the current fourth generation  In a normal speaker an electromagnet moves a voice cone which pushes on the surrounding air  causing pressure waves we perceive as sound  Rock is essentially immobile  so we had to modify the speaker to transmit force  stress  waves rather than waves of motion  strain  To do this we inverted the speaker and rigidly coupled the formly mobile voice cone to the rock  Now instead of a paper thin voice cone vibrating  the 30lb speaker frame translates up and down  Moving such a large inertial body transduces signficant force waves into the rock  which then couple for surprisingly long distances with the expected 1 r2 decrease in intensity vs  distance  This type of energy decrease is much less than the exponential decrease of 1 e r we would have seen if the rock was absorbing the energy rather than simply spreading it out over a wider area as it traveled  indicating this method can be used for signficantly greater distances than we
