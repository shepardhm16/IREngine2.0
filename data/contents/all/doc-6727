by Kelly Nye  Summer Program Uses Math to Solve Problem for Online Rental Company LEXINGTON  Va  July 1  2015   Some people love math  They enjoy reading a complicated word problem  applying the numbers to it  and solving it  Cadet Joe Bobay  17 is one of those people  The trick is finding problems that need solving  That s why VMI s Applied and Industrial Mathematics program was a sure fit for Bobay this summer  The AIM program  now in its fourth year  pairs cadets with businesses that have a problem and gives the cadets five weeks to use their math skills to find a solution  Laser Tag Source of Lynchburg rents laser tag equipment to companies in all 50 states  On the East Coast the rentals are en route for only two days  West Coast rentals  though  are a whole different story  often tying up equipment for weeks rather than days  But owner Mike Kirby thought the company was years away from opening a second location in the West   that is  until Bobay presented his findings  The journey to that presentation turned out to be very different from the textbook problems Bobay has solved for his classes   Very often it s a far more vague problem than students are used to  that s a big thing that s really good about this program   it s not  do this integral  explained Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics and AIM coordinator   In a real job no one is ever going to ask you to compute this covariance matrix or calculate this integral  they re going to ask you something that probably has a lot of math in it but they don t know it has a lot of math  In the Laser Tag problem  Bobay found he had to consider time as well as geography  Laser tag equipment is heavy and bulky  and the only way it can be shipped is by ground service   I just want to be able to present them with some data that says if you open a second location this is how much you ll be saving on shipping  this is how much of an increase you ll have on product availability  then be able to tell them whether   it is cost effective to open a new place or not  Maybe they need to wait longer  maybe they need to not do it at all  Coming to that conclusion is a tremendous learning experience for Bobay   Their worry stops when they sign up  Joe s worry starts when the project begins  said Maj  Ben Grannan  assistant professor of economics and business and Bobay s academic adviser on the project  As lead pastor of Lynchburg Church of God  Kirby started Laser Tag Source almost by accident  He had bought some laser tag equipment for a youth event  to make his money back afterward he rented out the equipment  discovering a demand that inspired him to launch a website  Three years later he found himself on the cusp of a coast to coast business   Basically we could open another location today  said Kirby  ready to explore Bobay s suggestion   Joe exceeded our exceptions and I was very impressed with his work  We were shocked to find out how much we could save by opening a second location  Getting a solution to a problem is only part of the point for some participating companies  Many businesses  said David  appreciate being able to provide a learning opportunity in addition to paying less for an expensive service in the professional world   The program is like an academically oriented consulting firm  David explained  Twenty one cadets have participated  with some of those experiences leading to job offers  And  though it s too soon to tell about career opportunities for Bobay  he will earn a math elective credit for the project   I would highly recommend this  AIM  program to any business owner who deals with large amounts of data   sales  marketing  shipping  etc  added Kirby   I am more than pleased with this project

Source    VMI Photo by Kelly Nye  Summer Program Uses Math to Solve Problem for Online Rental Company LEXINGTON  Va  July 1  2015   Some people love math  They enjoy reading a complicated word problem  applying the numbers to it  and solving it  Cadet Joe Bobay  17 is one of those people  The trick is finding problems that need solving  That s why VMI s Applied and Industrial Mathematics program was a sure fit for Bobay this summer  The AIM program  now in its fourth year  pairs cadets with businesses that have a problem and gives the cadets five weeks to use their math skills to find a solution  Laser Tag Source of Lynchburg rents laser tag equipment to companies in all 50 states  On the East Coast the rentals are en route for only two days  West Coast rentals  though  are a whole different story  often tying up equipment for weeks rather than days  But owner Mike Kirby thought the company was years away from opening a second location in the West   that is  until Bobay presented his findings  The journey to that presentation turned out to be very different from the textbook problems Bobay has solved for his classes   Very often it s a far more vague problem than students are used to  that s a big thing that s really good about this program   it s not  do this integral  explained Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics and AIM coordinator   In a real job no one is ever going to ask you to compute this covariance matrix or calculate this integral  they re going to ask you something that probably has a lot of math in it but they don t know it has a lot of math  In the Laser Tag problem  Bobay found he had to consider time as well as geography  Laser tag equipment is heavy and bulky  and the only way it can be shipped is by ground service   I just want to be able to present them with some data that says if you open a second location this is how much you ll be saving on shipping  this is how much of an increase you ll have on product availability  then be able to tell them whether   it is cost effective to open a new place or not  Maybe they need to wait longer  maybe they need to not do it at all  Coming to that conclusion is a tremendous learning experience for Bobay   Their worry stops when they sign up  Joe s worry starts when the project begins  said Maj  Ben Grannan  assistant professor of economics and business and Bobay s academic adviser on the project  As lead pastor of Lynchburg Church of God  Kirby started Laser Tag Source almost by accident  He had bought some laser tag equipment for a youth event  to make his money back afterward he rented out the equipment  discovering a demand that inspired him to launch a website  Three years later he found himself on the cusp of a coast to coast business   Basically we could open another location today  said Kirby  ready to explore Bobay s suggestion   Joe exceeded our exceptions and I was very impressed with his work  We were shocked to find out how much we could save by opening a second location  Getting a solution to a problem is only part of the point for some participating companies  Many businesses  said David  appreciate being able to provide a learning opportunity in addition to paying less for an expensive service in the professional world   The program is like an academically oriented consulting firm  David explained  Twenty one cadets have participated  with some of those experiences leading to job offers  And  though it s too soon to tell about career opportunities for Bobay  he will earn a math elective credit for the project   I would highly recommend this  AIM  program to any business owner who deals with large amounts of data   sales  marketing  shipping  etc  added Kirby   I am more than pleased with this project  Businesses interested in participating in the AIM program should visit http www vmi edu aim or contact David for more information    Kelly Nye  VMI Communications   Marketing News and
