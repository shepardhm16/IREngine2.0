Internet Enabled Medical Refrigerator by Matthew York  04  Paul Kuwick  05  Tom Largi  05  and Dennis Crump  06 Social mobility and an aging population have resulted in a higher number of elderly living alone without nearby family than ever before  and they are at risk of fatal complications from minor accidents because of lack of monitoring  Elderly diabetics are at particularly at risk from a host of diabetes related health complications  yet home healthcare services are frequently unaffordable or unavailable  We  as a team of four engineering students and advised by a biomedical engineer James Squire Ph D  computer engineer David Livingston Ph D  and physician Joseph Troise M D  designed a medical internet aware insulin refrigerator for such a patient living alone  The device consists of a small refrigerator monitored by an embedded microcontroller and connected to a standard telephone outlet  The microcontroller monitors patient access to the fridge  If the door is not opened in a 16 hour period  the microcontroller dials an Internet Service Provider and sends an email and or a pager alert to a physician or family member anywhere in the world  The system also has an integrated battery backup that automatically takes over if AC power fails  automatically charges when AC power is available  fully charges in under 60 minutes  and can sustain a two hour power outage  The refrigerator has been through two design evaluations with a physician and has been tested during a week long trial by a diabetic patient  The monitoring device can also be used with a standard refrigerator  so that loved ones or neighbors can be notified if an elderly person living alone does not access a standard refrigerator in a period of 24 hours  This approach not only increases the safety of elderly people living alone but it also provides peace of mind to their loved ones  Back
