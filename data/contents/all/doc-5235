the Colleville American Cemetery and three are buried at the St James British American Cemetery  Normandy  This page features the stories of alumni killed on D Day or during the subsequent campaign in Normandy  During the Landing  Under a bright moon at 0100 on 6 June  Lt  Freeling T  Colt  38 and the other paratroopers in the 101st Airborne Division boarded airplanes and took off from England  Approaching the coast of France  the planes encountered a heavy fog bank  then anti aircraft fire  the pilots took evasive action which broke the formations and scattered the planes  Consequently  when the men jumped  they were dispersed over a wide area  and most of them landed far away from their designated drop zones  A number of them drowned when they landed in fields that had been flooded by the Germans   a fact that had not been detected in the aerial photographs because the grasses had grown above the level of the water  Individually and in small groups  the paratroopers attempted to overcome these problems and accomplish their missions  One of the objectives of Lt  Colt s unit  the 506th Regiment  was to clear an exit route off Utah Beach for the troops which would be landing later that morning  The town of Ste  Marie du Mont was astride that route  it was heavily defended  and Lt  Colt was killed on June 6 in the action to take it  At 0430 on 6 June  Lt  Benjamin R  Kearfoot  43 and approximately 200 men of Company A  116th Regt  disembarked from their ship into seven landing craft and began the two hour trip to the beach  Comprised of Virginia National Guard troops   many of whom were from Bedford  VA   these men were scheduled to be the first to land in France that morning  Rough seas made it difficult for the boats to maintain formation  many of the men bailed water with their helmets to keep their landing craft afloat  one of the boats foundered  The remainder pressed on  and the boats finally grounded  but in water that varied between waist deep to over a man s head  The ramps dropped and as if this was a signal  German machine guns immediately opened up from both ends of the beach  sweeping across the lines of floundering men in a deadly crossing fire  Some of the men sank and drowned  most of those who managed to get ashore were cut down  Lt  Kearfoot landed in a boat with twenty nine other men  all were immediately killed  either by the cross fire or from a direct hit by a shell   precisely what happened to the men in that boat will never be known  In short order  all of the officers and NCOs were casualties  and in a span of less than ten minutes  Company A virtually ceased to exist  After the Landings  After six costly and frustrating weeks of fighting  the American command mounted  Operation Cobra  on July 25  a major offensive preceded by a massive aerial bombing campaign intended to literally blast a path in the German lines through which the troops could pass  In the days following the landings  more men and equipment poured ashore and the effort shifted from establishing a beachhead to penetrating the German lines and moving inland  For many of the units  this was their first combat and their introduction was made worse by the fact that they had not anticipated the challenges presented by the hedgerows  thick high hedges  many with narrow lanes sunken between them and which broke up the countryside into small meadows and fields of an acre or less  The French term was  bocages   which roughly translates as  box country The hedges provided natural fortifications to the defending Germans  and progress was painfully slow  a squad of infantry might have to cross 30 of these  boxes  in order to gain one mile  An Army survey found that during the period between 6 June and 31 July  casualties in many of the infantry units exceeded sixty percent  A member of the 2nd Armored Division  Capt  Dan J  Morton  41 came ashore at Normandy on 9 June  His unit supported elements of the 101st Airborne in repelling a German counterattack  it then continued general offensive operations attempting to break out of Normandy and move inland  While participating in Operation Cobra on 28 July  Capt  Morton s unit was moving up behind the lead vehicles near the town of Vaillebauden when the column was suddenly cut by four German tanks attacking from the flank  Capt  Morton promptly dismounted from his vehicle and  assuming command of two light tanks  moved to intercept the Germans  His tank received a direct hit and he was killed  He was awarded the Silver Star posthumously  and the citation made mention of the commendable example he set  noting that as the S 2  he was not required to be in the forward element of the column nor expected to operate a tank  The 803rd Tank Destroyer Battalion with Capt  Sydney A  Vincent  Jr   40 landed in Normandy a week after D Day  and on 18 July he and his troops were supporting an infantry battalion on the outskirts of the town of St  Lo  After observing an American tank shooting unsuccessfully at a suspected German observation post  Vincent approached the battalion commander   who happened to be Maj  Glover S  Johns  31   and was given permission to  take a crack at it  He moved his tank destroyer   a large tracked vehicle with a slightly heavier gun than the tank   out from behind the protection of a building into the open street and snapped off a shot which was immediately answered by a German 88m shell  After an exchange of several more rounds  the German 88 disabled Vincent s vehicle and put a hole in the wall of Maj  Johns  command post  Vincent and his crew were unhurt  however  the Germans then called in mortars and he was fatally wounded  He was awarded the Silver Star posthumously  Capt  Harold C  Sheffey  37 came ashore with the 83rd Infantry Division on 21 June  relieving elements of the 101st Airborne which were then locked up with crack German Waffen SS and Paratroops in the Carentan sector  Holding this city was vital to the success of the invasion  the Germans had already mounted one counterattack which had almost retaken the town  and the Americans readied an offensive that would consolidate and expand their positions  The terrain favored the German defenders  who extracted a heavy toll on the Americans as they pushed ahead  Capt  Sheffey was killed on 16 July as his unit engaged the Germans on the outskirts of the village of Carentan  Maj  Alexander C  Newton  31 landed with the 4th Armored Division on 11 July and immediately moved to support offensive operations to punch through the German defenses  Major Newton served as the S 2 and assistant S 3  and participated in the planning of Operation Cobra  On the third day of the operation  units of the 4th Armored Division met heavy resistance advancing on the town of Coutances  and Major Newton was killed in that action on 29 July        Situated on a bluff overlooking Omaha Beach and the English Channel  the American Cemetery at Normandy consists of 172 acres which have been granted by France in a perpetual concession to the United States  This is the final resting place of almost 9 400 American soldiers  most of whom were killed during the landings and the ensuing campaigns in France  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index
