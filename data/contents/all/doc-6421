May 2  2014   Under clearing spring skies following days of rain  ground was broken yesterday for Phases I and II of the  122 million Corps Physical Training Facilities  The project  which is expected to take 25 months to complete  will include construction of a new building and renovation of two others on the VMI post  Leading the team of 10 people wielding ceremonial shovels for the event was Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendent  He was joined by several members of the VMI administration  along with representatives of the architect  HKS Inc  and the contractor  Whiting Turner   This is an exciting day at VMI  said Peay just before he and the others began to dig   We ve had an incredible number of projects here at VMI  and I m as excited about this as any other  The Corps Physical Training Facility  which is part of Peay s Vision 2039 for the Institute  has been in the conceptual and planning stages for over five years  The Virginia General Assembly approved funding for the project in 2013  Phase I of the project will include a new 205 000 square foot indoor training facility across Diamond Street from Cameron Hall  Construction will begin Monday  May 5  and the building is expected to be complete in July 2016  The new   80 million building will include an underground parking deck with about 126 spaces  a state of the art hydraulic track  obstacle and high ropes courses  a 34 foot climbing wall  locker rooms  and restrooms  The facility will be used for cadet and ROTC training  It will also be home to VMI s NCAA track team  which has been using Cormack Hall for its events   VMI is more excited about this project than many that have been constructed over the past decade  said Peay immediately after the groundbreaking   It s so multipurpose in its capability  The superintendent noted that not only will the building benefit the Corps of Cadets  who oftentimes find that Lexington s harsh winters hamper their physical training efforts  but will also be of use to the community  The facility will be available for community use on a rental basis  as are many other VMI facilities  and it is expected to be an attractive venue for high school and college track meets   This facility will be one of the best Olympic tracks on the East Coast  said Peay  In planning for the construction of the indoor training facility  much has been done to minimize the environmental impact  said Col  Keith Jarvis  deputy director of construction  The building site includes a small stream  Town Branch  which carries storm water away from the city of Lexington and into the Maury River  Jarvis said that plans call for Town Branch to be expanded into a detention basin that will slowly release its waters into the river  The new building will be supported by concrete piers straddling the reconfigured Town Branch  In addition  a historic structure will be moved to accommodate the facility  Jarvis explained that the Knights of Pythias building  a structure important to the history of Lexington s African American community  will be relocated approximately 100 yards south and placed on a new foundation  That move will take place this summer  During construction  parking will be eliminated along Main Street across from the project site  and also along part of Diamond Street nearest Cameron Hall  Public parking will be restored once the project is completed   VMI will do everything possible to work with the community and alert them to disruptions of traffic and parking  said Col  Stewart MacInnis  director of VMI communications and marketing  Peay added that the entrance into Lexington from U S  11 heading south will be aesthetically improved once the indoor training facility has been completed   Two years on this project will go by quickly and all of the disruption will be soon forgotten  the superintendent said   There ll be great joy when the community sees this particular facility  Phase II of the project  which will run concurrently with Phase I  includes the renovation of Cormack Hall as a home for VMI s physical education department  The building  which was first an equestrian training facility  will be renovated to include classrooms  weight training rooms  mat sports venues with seating  and facilities for VMI s new exercise science minor  The newly renovated Cormack Hall will be home to VMI s NCAA wrestling program  Work will begin this summer and should be completed by the summer of 2015  Rounding out Phase II will be the renovation of Cocke Hall  which has long served as VMI s main gymnasium  as well as a venue for dances and other social activities  Cocke Hall will be equipped with a brand new weight room and strength training facilities  along with new locker rooms  The building will then be used by cadets  faculty  and staff for their fitness needs  Work on the Cocke Hall renovation will begin in the summer of 2015 and is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2016  The

LEXINGTON  Va  May 2  2014   Under clearing spring skies following days of rain  ground was broken yesterday for Phases I and II of the  122 million Corps Physical Training Facilities  The project  which is expected to take 25 months to complete  will include construction of a new building and renovation of two others on the VMI post  Leading the team of 10 people wielding ceremonial shovels for the event was Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendent  He was joined by several members of the VMI administration  along with representatives of the architect  HKS Inc  and the contractor  Whiting Turner   This is an exciting day at VMI  said Peay just before he and the others began to dig   We ve had an incredible number of projects here at VMI  and I m as excited about this as any other  The Corps Physical Training Facility  which is part of Peay s Vision 2039 for the Institute  has been in the conceptual and planning stages for over five years  The Virginia General Assembly approved funding for the project in 2013  Phase I of the project will include a new 205 000 square foot indoor training facility across Diamond Street from Cameron Hall  Construction will begin Monday  May 5  and the building is expected to be complete in July 2016  The new   80 million building will include an underground parking deck with about 126 spaces  a state of the art hydraulic track  obstacle and high ropes courses  a 34 foot climbing wall  locker rooms  and restrooms  The facility will be used for cadet and ROTC training  It will also be home to VMI s NCAA track team  which has been using Cormack Hall for its events   VMI is more excited about this project than many that have been constructed over the past decade  said Peay immediately after the groundbreaking   It s so multipurpose in its capability  The superintendent noted that not only will the building benefit the Corps of Cadets  who oftentimes find that Lexington s harsh winters hamper their physical training efforts  but will also be of use to the community  The facility will be available for community use on a rental basis  as are many other VMI facilities  and it is expected to be an attractive venue for high school and college track meets   This facility will be one of the best Olympic tracks on the East Coast  said Peay  In planning for the construction of the indoor training facility  much has been done to minimize the environmental impact  said Col  Keith Jarvis  deputy director of construction  The building site includes a small stream  Town Branch  which carries storm water away from the city of Lexington and into the Maury River  Jarvis said that plans call for Town Branch to be expanded into a detention basin that will slowly release its waters into the river  The new building will be supported by concrete piers straddling the reconfigured Town Branch  In addition  a historic structure will be moved to accommodate the facility  Jarvis explained that the Knights of Pythias building  a structure important to the history of Lexington s African American community  will be relocated approximately 100 yards south and placed on a new foundation  That move will take place this summer  During construction  parking will be eliminated along Main Street across from the project site  and also along part of Diamond Street nearest Cameron Hall  Public parking will be restored once the project is completed   VMI will do everything possible to work with the community and alert them to disruptions of traffic and parking  said Col  Stewart MacInnis  director of VMI communications and marketing  Peay added that the entrance into Lexington from U S  11 heading south will be aesthetically improved once the indoor training facility has been completed   Two years on this project will go by quickly and all of the disruption will be soon forgotten  the superintendent said   There ll be great joy when the community sees this particular facility  Phase II of the project  which will run concurrently with Phase I  includes the renovation of Cormack Hall as a home for VMI s physical education department  The building  which was first an equestrian training facility  will be renovated to include classrooms  weight training rooms  mat sports venues with seating  and facilities for VMI s new exercise science minor  The newly renovated Cormack Hall will be home to VMI s NCAA wrestling program  Work will begin this summer and should be completed by the summer of 2015  Rounding out Phase II will be the renovation of Cocke Hall  which has long served as VMI s main gymnasium  as well as a venue for dances and other social activities  Cocke Hall will be equipped with a brand new weight room and strength training facilities  along with new locker rooms  The building will then be used by cadets  faculty  and staff for their fitness needs  Work on the Cocke Hall renovation will begin in the summer of 2015 and is scheduled for completion in the summer of 2016  The superintendent added that after years of planning  he and others are energized to see dirt being moved   We re excited to break ground and be under way with the first of these three projects that will serve the Corps of Cadets so well  said Peay   Mary Price  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos Cindy Bither Administrative Assistant P
