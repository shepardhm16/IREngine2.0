embraces the properties  composition  and structure of matter  the changes in structure and composition that matter undergoes  and the accompanying energy changes  It is important to distinguish chemical change  implicit in this definition  and changes in physical form Modern chemistry grew out of the alchemy of the Middle Ages  and the attempts to transmute base metals into gold  Seminal observations were made in the early eighteenth century on the changes in volume of air during combustion in a closed vessel  and the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier in the 1770s interpreted these phenomena in essentially modern terms  You can read more of this article by using AccessScience  the online version of the McGraw Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology  Use the blue tabs to
