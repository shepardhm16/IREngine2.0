Maria Erchul with the Virginia General Assembly memorial proclamation honoring her father    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  April 10  2012   Gen J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendant  introduced the 23rd annual Environment Virginia Symposium by honoring the contributions of the late Capt  Ronald Erchul to the nation  to the state of Virginia  and to VMI  More than 760 registrants came to Lexington to participate in the symposium  Capt  Erchul s daughter  Maria B  Erchul  was on hand to receive a Virginia General Assembly memorial proclamation  Capt  Erchul was a VMI professor of civil and environmental engineering for more than 25 years  He organized and chaired the first Environment Virginia Symposium in 1990 and coordinated the event in succeeding years until his retirement  The Erchul Environmental Leadership Award  given at the symposium banquet  also honors his contributions  Erchul spoke of the passion that her father had for life  and she sees that same passion in symposium participants   Today  as I stand amongst colleagues and friends  it is evident that you too have experienced this passion  said Erchul   You are carrying out what you believe to be true for the good of the community and the state and to lead our nation to become a smarter and wiser country through our talented citizen students  This year s theme    Collaboration  Innovation  Results    recognizes the need to bring experts together to look at issues in a new light   Until we ask the right questions  we cannot find the right solutions  said Peay   I think this symposium helps us to ask the right questions  Following the welcoming ceremonies  a panel of four former Virginia secretaries of natural resources  hosted by Doug Domenech  the current Virginia secretary of natural resources  took part in a discussion  offering a wealth of experience and knowledge on solving environmental challenges  Tayloe Murphy  who was secretary from 2002 to 2006  described the progress that had been made through bipartisan cooperation in the past  He emphasized the fact that this type of cooperation is now being stifled by the political climate   The threat that I see is in the increased polarization among our citizens and our public officials along partisan lines  said Murphy   We must hold our elected officials accountable when they fail to govern in a bipartisan manner  Members of the panel emphasized the importance of water conservation and cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay  Bringing Virginians together to explore challenges like these is an essential component of the symposium   The commonwealth is filled with wonderful people who care about our natural resources and our environment  said Becky Norton Dunlop  vice president for external
