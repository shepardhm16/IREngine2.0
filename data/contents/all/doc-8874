to accurately establish  Fortunately  for the Federals an official report of casualties for each Unit engaged was made out on May 22  1864  but somehow it never found its way into the Official Records  nor is it to be found in the National Archives  However  the New York Tribune published it in full on May 27  1864  and this is the source of most of the Federal figures below  Confederate losses are more difficult to come by  though a few scattered reports exist  For the purposes of this list  only casualties of those units engaged in the main battle are listed  losses suffered before or after that are not included  Information adopted from The Battle of New Market by William C  Davis For More information New Market Cadet Graves  Picture Trail  New Market s Lone Medal of Honor Federal Army
