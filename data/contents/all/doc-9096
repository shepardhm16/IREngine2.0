Laser Communications Demonstration by the ECE senior design class of  01  Matt Brooks  02  and Brian Holt  03 We designed and built a display for the Science Museum of Western Virginia to intuitively demonstrate how an audio signal may be transmitted by light  which is at the heart of today s fiber optic telephone and internet communications systems  This design project won third place in VMI s 2002 Undergraduate Research Symposium  An analog signal from a CD player is first sampled at 128kHz  128 000 times a second  and at each sample the magnitude of the audio intensity is represented by a number from 0 255  or in binary  00000000 to 11111111  Each of the eight binary digits then drives a corresponding laser  the lipstick shaped elements arranged vertically in the photo above  The signal is received by phototransistors on the right  decoded into a continuous voltage waveform by a digital to analog converter  and then amplified and played  The lasers are visible through a protective plexiglass enclosure  and museum visitors may interact with the demonstration by moving a sliding bar that selectively blocks the laser beams and causes a degradation in signal quality  This project was jointly completed by the ECE senior class of 2001 supervised by COL Dan Barr and by Matt Brooks  02  and Brian Holt  03  supervised by MAJ Jim Squire  Back
