1864  New Market Battle of New Market   May 15  1864  From the VMI Annual Report  July 1864 New Market top level   This report was writtenby Gen  Francis H  Smith  Superintendent From the original document in the VMI Archives   On the night of the 10th May a dispatch was received from Major General J C  Breckinridge  by special courier  calling upon me for cooperation on the part of the corps of cadets  in his effort to repel the advance of General Sigel  Orders were immediately given to Lieutenant Colonel S  Ship  commandant of cadets  to proceed without delay  with a battalion of infantry of four companies  and a section of artillery  and to report to General Breckinridge at Staunton  Having previously communicated to General Breckinridge the letter of General R E  Lee  addressed to the adjutant general of Virginia  and the instructions of the governor  as conveyed in general orders of date September 5  1863  I signified to him my readiness to give to him such support as my authority under these instructions would warrant  The corps of cadets was accordingly placed at the disposal of General Breckinridge  subject to the limitations thus expressed  As soon as the cadets reached Staunton  the command of General Breckinridge immediately moved down the Valley to meet the enemy  A sanguinary battle took place on the 15th May  near New Market  resulting in a signal victory by the confederate forces  the capture of a battery of artillery  many small arms  horses and prisoners  The enemy were pursued to Mount Jackson  where the further pursuit was arrested by their burning the bridge behind them  In this sanguinary battle the cadets were engaged  and the casualties reported  six killed and forty two wounded  show the prominent part borne by them in this struggle  I have been informed by Gen  Breckinridge that it was not his intention to put the cadets into the battle  unless absolutely required  He considered the necessity for using them urgent  and had they not been freely used  the result of the battle  in his judgment  might have been different  He assured me that the officers and cadets had borne themselves with conspicuous gallantry  and it was a source of great satisfaction to him to bear testimony to their patient endurance of severe hardships  under a forced march in a storm of rain  and the fine discipline exhibited by them through the whole expedition  The report of Lieut  Col  Ship will present in detail the events of this memorable battle with the names of those who participated in it  with the list of killed and wounded  Having been prevented by illness from accompanying the cadets on this expedition  Col  Gilham was requested to go as acting superintendent  that he might provide for the general wants and comfort of the cadets  and discharge such duties as would properly devolve upon the superintendent  He was enabled to provide for the wounded  and to have proper arrangements made for the burial of the killed  Having joined the Corps in Staunton  I there received the orders of the adjutant general directing me to move the cadets to Richmond to aid in the defense of the capital  Having reported to the governor and secretary of war  in obedience to orders  the cadets were assigned to the command of Maj  Gen  Ransom  and were encamped about two miles from the city limits  The next section of this report concerns General David Hunter s advance on Lexington  Virginia  known locally as Hunter s Raid  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
