top level Head Quarters Virginia Military Institute December 2nd  1870 General Orders No  36 It is the painful duty of the Superintendent to announce to the Professors  Officers and Cadets  the death of Colonel William D  Washington  late Professor of the Fine Arts in this Institution  He died at 20 minutes of 10 o clock last night  Feeble in his physical constitution from childhood  he had suffered all his life from chronic disease which finally terminated in his death  after a rapid and brief illness  Col  Washington was endowed by nature with gifts of genius to a very high degree  and these gifts had been sedulously cultivated by study and foreign travel As an artist he was rapidly rising to distinction in his Profession  his chief work of Art   The Burial of Latane  having given him wide reputation  In the midst of his usefulness his career has closed before he had reached the meridian of life  As an appropriate mark of respect to the memory of the deceased  academic duties will be suspended until after his interment  and the usual badge of mourning will be worn by Professors  officers  and cadets  for the period of thirty  30  days  The interment will take place at 11 AM tomorrow under a funeral escort of the Battalion of Cadets  in such order as may be prescribed by the Commandant of Cadet  By Command of General F  H  Smith  Superintendent s Office Virginia Military Institute Lexington  VA December 2  1870 The Academic Board met at the call of the Superintendent  Present  all except Commodore Maury  The Superintendent announced the death of Col  W  D  Washington  Professor of Fine Arts of the Virginia Military Institute  whereupon the following minute was unanimously adopted   ordered to be spread upon the records of the Academic Board  Resolved  That it is with feelings of peculiar solemnity that we record upon our minutes the first death  by natural causes  occurring in the Professorial Corps of the Virginia Military Institute  since its establishment in 1839  The last added to our number has been the first thus removed  We recall to mind with sorrowful tenderness his genius  his accomplishments  his sensibility  his high toned principles  and the purity and delicacy of his nature  constantly manifested in his intercourse with his brother officers  By nature he was fitted for Art  and to the cultivation of it he gave himself with unreserved love and assiduity  The Gallery of this Institute is adorned by his labors with works  to us  of inestimable value  and we mourn when we consider how much is left undone of what he proposed to do for the Institution to which he belonged  and for his native State  Virginia  In the midst of his labors he has been called away  and in the prime of life  His work will survive him  and with pride and with sorrow his memory will be cherished by us all  Col  Washington was born in Loudoun County  VA  on the 7th October 1833 He early manifested his taste for Art  and when quite a young man  was draftsman in the U  S  Patent Office  Washington  where he laid the foundation of those studies which he subsequently prosecuted in the best schools of art in Europe  During the late Civil War he served on the Staff of Gen  Floyd  and took advantage of this period of duty in the mountains of Va  to make those sketches of mountain scenery which he afterwards put upon canvas  His physical infirmity kept him in Richmond during the greater period of the war  and in this interval  besides many smaller pieces  he painted the more elaborate work  The Burial of Latane  and  Jackson Entering Winchester  At the close of the war he established his studio in New York and in July 1869 was called to the Virginia Military Institute as Professor of Fine Arts  and was more especially occupied in painting the portraits of the alumni of the Va  M  Institute who fell during the war  His taste soon gave form to the  Corcoran Gallery of Art  of the Virginia Military Institute  and the walls of this Gallery are now ornamented with the portraits of Gen  R  E  Lee  Gen  T  J  Jackson  Gen  R  E  Rodes  Gen  Samuel Garland  Col  S  Crutchfield  Col  Geo  S  Patton  Col  W  T  Patton
