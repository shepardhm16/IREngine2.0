Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Can Conflict in Nigeria Threaten the United States  Download pdf Tombarge  OK  maybe one last question  Is Boko Haram and maybe more broadly the Nigerian unrest  is that a threat to the West  Hentz  That was asked on the Sunday talk shows  this Sunday  I usually watch a handful of them  Every single one asked  why the focus on ISIL  Boko Haram is killing as many people  They haven t done as well playing CNN  with you know  Jihad Joe  and the answer from the Washington insiders  these were  you know  joint chiefs of staff type people  is that no  we re keeping a close eye on north and west Africa  we do think it s a national security concern for the United States  Yes  the Middle East  ISIL are sort of taking front page news  And I can also tell you as somebody who does some consulting for the U S  there I was on the phone for an hour two days ago with somebody traveling to Niger and Mali and the borderline areas  setting up programs trying to drain what we call the swamp  which means creating programs for men and women to change the opportunity costs of joining the insurgency  make it so that this isn t the only option  So I think we re pretty well aware  ISIL s got  the  front page  France grabbed the front page  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen s up there  but I think you re going to see over the next year that not just Boko Haram again but the whole Trans Sahel area is going to be a high priority for U S  national security  Gire  I absolutely agree that it is a problem  And   at this point would be a mistake because it s just like within Nigeria when it first started the central government ignored it and it was just some distraction and it just continued to grow to the point where it is now  What is interesting    with the situation in France  that  killed a few people  at that same time 2 000 people were killed in Nigeria  In fact even other African countries  that  sometimes refrain from criticizing Nigeria came down hard against Jonathan because he was one of the first leaders to send words of sympathy to France and had not mentioned a word about the 2 000 people that were killed in his own country  More than that  Boko Haram didn t start initially in terms of physical violence  it just progressed over time  The activities are becoming not only more explosive but more sophisticated  The general belief now is that they have training links with Al Qaeda  So if we re interested in Al Qaeda in Yemen  we ought to be interested in Boko Haram in Nigeria or other similar groups as well because eventually  there s going to be that link  Now what is happening  Jim being the scholarly expert in this area may bring his perspective as well  it is coming to a point where it is no longer block  big blocks groups like ISIL or Boko Haram  but the influence they have on young people  which is interesting mentioning draining the swamp  the folks who carried out the attacks on France and so on were not foreigners  they were French citizens  who had influence there  They come back with the passports of their own countries  they re not viewed as groups  but they re the most difficult to stop  And so it s in everyone s interest to recognize this for the serious problem that it is and ensure that it does not spread because otherwise it will splinter into these little fragments that are very difficult to contain from a broad national attack perspective  You can t take the U S  army against a few individuals who just returned from Syria  one of whom is in Kansas  one of whom is in Maine  another of whom is from a different part of the country  How are you going to use the forces as currently put together  Hentz  I would add a couple of things  Again  we are paying attention  I should have mentioned that the U S  military has an operation called Operation Flintlock  which is I think is in its third iteration if not  the  fourth  where the U S military holds an exercise in the Trans Sahel  which is a multinational exercise bringing the different armies together to cooperate  This year it s going to be held in Chad  I think just next month probably  Back to comparing it to ISIL or to Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula  all over the news right now is this notion that ISIL and AQAP are going to start trying to outbid each other for the more outstanding terrorist event   you can call this the CNN effect on steroids  right  If you want to get on the news  you have to be the one who does the most spectacular event  I don t know why they don t bring Boko Haram in here too  Shekau likes to be on TV  He likes publicity  and in fact  it s kind of we re back to James s 2 000  It s look at me  I just killed 2 000 people and you re not even looking at me  I m guessing  the amateur psychiatrist in me    pointing at Gire  he s the psychologist   says  he s going back saying  oh what do I have to do now  to get on TV  right  So all these different conflicts are linked  and then one last point  I think  not only do we have to take a regional approach  we have to take a holistic approach  We have to understand in a globalized world how events in France affect Niger  how events in Tunisia affect Libya  how events in Libya affect Nigeria  how events in Yemen affect Boko Haram  This is not just a regional challenge  this is a global challenge  from Minnesota to Paris to London to Nigeria  this is a global challenge so when you ignore one part of that challenge  you re making the entire challenge bigger  so you need to pay attention to Boko Haram or else the problem will get bigger  Copyright   2015 Virginia Military Institute  For academic and news media use only  No quotes from the materials contained herein may be
