Computerized Parking Garage by Brian Holt  Jenny Dineen  Tsung Ta Ho  03 Increasing traffic density is causing severe parking lot congestion in many areas of the country  One day as Brian Holt found himself endlessly circling a parking garage he thought there has to be a better way to route cars to a predetermined parking location  There have been several proposed methods to do this  but yet no systems have been implemented to route cars in a crowded garage to an optimal parking space in a cheap and efficient manner  By combining principles from electrical engineering  computer engineering  and mathematics we have developed an algorithm and supporting hardware internet based system that provides a solution to this difficult problem  The parking guidance system uses sensors placed in the vicinity of each parking location to detect vacancy  The data from the sensors is then transmitted to a main computer  Data is collected from each car entering a garage  both using automatic sensors  acquiring vehicle width and height  for example  and manually via a touch screen  asking questions such as  near what store would you prefer to park  Do you require handicapped access  The user need not enter any manual data  it is entirely optional and any data not provided will be filled with default answers  e g  if no desired store is listed  then the car will be routed to the parking spot closest to any entrance  An algorithm was developed that uses matrix algebra to compare the data describing the user s needs with data describing every available parking space  and assigns a weighted score to each parking location  The optimal parking location is determined from this score and communicated to the user via a display at the entrance and by a printed ticket  All parking statistics are also available remotely via the Internet through a web server  which constantly updates every couple of seconds  This enables parkers to decide which parking garage to select in a large mall with multiple garages  and provides parking lot management with real time data that may be used to automatically reroute traffic from full lots to available lots or move parking attendants  We received patent protection for this algorithm based system  Although systems have been developed that guide cars to predetermined spots  this system differs in the fact that the algorithm considers both the garage managers input and user customers input  It is also flexible  nearly any parameter can be described by the garage manager  This project was jointly completed by Brian Holt  03  Jenny Dineen  03  Tsung Ta Ho  03  and advised by MAJ James Squire  with MAJ Troy Siemers advising on algorithm development  Back
