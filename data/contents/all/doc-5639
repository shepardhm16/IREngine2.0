Captains Crespo Bosiak  Jackson and Floyd of the US Air Force  The unit travelled to the island on a KC 135 Refueling plane provided by the 434th Airwing from Grissom AFB in Indiana  The Cadets were hosted by Lt  Col  Jose Plaza and the US Army Puerto Rican Fusion Cell whose hospitality and kindliness made the entire ten days a marvelous tour  The Fusion Cell arranged bus and van transportation  billets and food at the Camp Santiago Training Center in Salinas  and all of the performances and tours for the entire week  The cadets were greeted by and gave an  old yell  to Co   Ret  Roberto Gorbea  62 a prominent businessman  and BR of our Superintendent  Gen  JBH Peay III  who generously donated the use of two 15 passenger vans for transportation to and from the base for the entire week  The Club performed at three large Veterans hospitals and a Veterans retirement home  there are over 165 000 Veterans in Puerto Rico  the Ponce Museum of Art  Puerto Rico s premier art museum  and on St  Patrick s Day at the Community Club at Ft  Buchannan in San Juan as guests of Colonel John Cushman  Base Commander   The highlight of the week of performances was a concert on 15 March at a

their concerts and interaction with the people of Puerto Rico  The cadets then spent the rest of the day exploring El Morro and Old San Juan before returning to Camp Santiago  The cadets were also

to the home of Fernando and Hernando Perez  private caterers who threw a big cook out for the cadets and staff at their home in Caguas  The most remarkable aspect of the trip was the minimal cost of the trip as billets  air travel and much of the food was provided through the auspices of the Puerto Rican Army Fusion Cell  The cost of taking 43 cadets and staff for ten days was  25 dollars per person day  This could not have been accomplished without the generous support of Lt  Col  Plaza and the Fusion Cell  the 434th Indiana Airwing  and Colonel Gorbea  62  VMI Foundation Keydet Club
