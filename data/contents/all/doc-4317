industrial workplace  The faculty advisors have the opportunity to be involved with a very select group of students in a summer activity  while contributing to research in the fields of applied mathematics and computer science  Clients have the opportunity to tangibly support education and  at a low cost  obtain solutions to problems that would most likely not be addressed internally  Clients also get the opportunity to see first hand the caliber of VMI cadets which is opportunity for the clients to recruit talented potential employees  The structure of the program is based upon several research teams which work independently on separate projects  but also come together for discussion of progress  These teams are comprised of students  usually two three  and a faculty advisor  The faculty advisor involvement is heavy initially as the student team becomes familiar with the project definition  After approximately two weeks  involvement becomes primarily advisory as the students work directly with client representatives and others  Student teams give weekly progress reports in the form of oral presentations  in addition to periodic presentations to their respective clients  Each team also gives a final oral presentation and written report to the client upon completion of the project Applied and Industrial Mathematics  AIM  at VMI AIM Program Flyer This program gives cadets from VMI experience in the practical applications of applied mathematics and computer science which the classroom cannot provide  For five ten weeks of the summer  student teams and faculty advisors from VMI are joined with a  usually local  business  industry  or government agency  client  This partnership is beneficial to all involved  The student participants are exposed to the practical applications of mathematics and computer science in a  real world  setting and acquire knowledge which will aid them in their senior capstone project and later in life  including contact
