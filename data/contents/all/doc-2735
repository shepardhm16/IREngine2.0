morning will be a happy one for area children who might have awakened to an empty tree if not for hardworking VMI athletes  VMI s Student Athlete Advisory Committee recently completed a drive to collect gifts for Toys for Tots  the annual charity event created by the United States Marine Corps  In all  athletes from 12 of VMI s athletic teams collected five large boxes of toys  about 75 total   They took it and ran with it  said James  J B  Weber  director of VMI s Cadet Athlete Development Office   Every cadet athlete that brought a toy in brought it in with a smile  Still in its infancy as an organization   VMI s committee was formed in the spring of 2014   SAAC serves as the athlete voice to the Institute  the Southern Conference  and the NCAA  addressing student athlete issues and speaking out on proposed regulations  It also serves as tool for leadership development  and one of its goals is to engage the athletes in community service opportunities  The Toys for Tots drive was the latest effort in that direction   the first was Change for Change to benefit ALS in memory of former VMI soccer coach Tony Conway   and the hope is that the toy drive will become an annual event  The toy drive  said Weber  was the idea of SAAC president Garrett Warren  16  a member of the lacrosse team   We wanted to do something that was a direct benefit to the community  and Garrett came up with the toy drive   Now that we know the logistics  Weber continued   if we open this up from the beginning of the term  we could do far  far better  This year s drive became a competition among the teams  with each team receiving points for the number of toys it collected  The women s swimming water polo squads ended up collecting the most points  and the lacrosse squad placed second   It s healthy competition  noted Catherine  Catie  Berry  18  the women s swimming team s SAAC representative   It s fun  But it s serious work  too  The teams spent Ring Figure weekend and Thanksgiving furlough collecting toys  Each went about the task differently   We  women s swimming water polo  pooled together a whole bunch of money  and then we went to Wal Mart that day and bought tons of different toys  Berry explained   We all rallied together  Warren said that he returned to post after Thanksgiving to a stack of toys on his desk  left there by many of the rats on the squad  No matter how they went about collecting the toys  most of them did so with the same warm feeling   It s exciting  said Berry  who was the first VMI athlete to bring in a toy   because you know someone is going to wake up on Christmas morning and have a SAAC toy waiting for them  It may seem small  but to someone else it s going so be much bigger   I would just call it special  Warren said   Even though I m not going to be there to see it  I know kids are going to open those toys and be very happy   Chris Floyd  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES

tree if not for hardworking VMI athletes  VMI s Student Athlete Advisory Committee recently completed a drive to collect gifts for Toys for Tots  the annual charity event created by the United States Marine Corps  In all  athletes from 12 of VMI s athletic teams collected five large boxes of toys  about 75 total   They took it and ran with it  said James  J B  Weber  director of VMI s Cadet Athlete Development Office   Every cadet athlete that brought a toy in brought it in with a smile  Still in its infancy as an organization   VMI s committee was formed in the spring of 2014   SAAC serves as the athlete voice to the Institute  the Southern Conference  and the NCAA  addressing student athlete issues and speaking out on proposed regulations  It also serves as tool for leadership development  and one of its goals is to engage the athletes in community service opportunities  The Toys for Tots drive was the latest effort in that direction   the first was Change for Change to benefit ALS in memory of former VMI soccer coach Tony Conway   and the hope is that the toy drive will become an annual event  The toy drive  said Weber  was the idea of SAAC president Garrett Warren  16  a member of the lacrosse team   We wanted to do something that was a direct benefit to the community  and Garrett came up with the toy drive   Now that we know the logistics  Weber continued   if we open this up from the beginning of the term  we could do far  far better  This year s drive became a competition among the teams  with each team receiving points for the number of toys it collected  The women s swimming water polo squads ended up collecting the most points  and the lacrosse squad placed second   It s healthy competition  noted Catherine  Catie  Berry  18  the women s swimming team s SAAC representative   It s fun  But it s serious work  too  The teams spent Ring Figure weekend and Thanksgiving furlough collecting toys  Each went about the task differently   We  women s swimming water polo  pooled together a whole bunch of money  and then we went to Wal Mart that day and bought tons of different toys  Berry explained   We all rallied together  Warren said that he returned to post after Thanksgiving to a stack of toys on his desk  left there by many of the rats on the squad  No matter how they went about collecting the toys  most of them did so with the same warm feeling   It s exciting  said Berry  who was the first VMI athlete to bring in a toy   because you know someone is going to wake up on Christmas morning and have a SAAC toy waiting for them  It may seem small  but to someone else it s going so be much bigger   I would just call it special  Warren said   Even though I m not going to be there to see it  I know kids are going to open those toys and be very happy   Chris Floyd  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos Cindy Bither Administrative Assistant P   540  464 7207 F   540
