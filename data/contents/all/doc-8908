Source Finder The SourceFinder   SourceFinder is an online resource that allows users to quickly and easily generate a  Source List  of important study materials  Sources compiled when the user runs the SourceFinder may range from databases  to Web pages  to printed reference works  depending on the options the user selects  Overview and Purpose The SourceFinder was designed to replace 15  static  online study guides developed and maintained by Preston Library staff members  An example of the old study guides we used can be seen here  English and Fine Arts Study Guide  Two key goals drove our development of the SourceFinder  to decrease maintenance issues for librarians who create such lists  and to allow patrons the power to create their own  customized  lists    The SourceFinder is modeled largely on The Data Genie  created by Paul Adalian at California Polytechnic State University  San Luis Obispo  Similar resources have been created by Dickinson College and Cornell  While the SourceFinder has taken time and effort to develop  we believe it will be easier than creating and maintaining numerous study guides over the long run  It takes the place of nearly 20 individual study guides and lists of links  including lists arranged  by subject  format  and title    Furthermore  it allows the user to decide how to arrange resources  instead of forcing them to conform to lists created by librarians  In addition to centralization and ease of use  the SourceFinder provides a consistent template for all web pages generated  That means pages will automatically be consistent in style and appearance  and that subject specialists entering new resources do not need to know any HTML  Finally  it should be pointed out that the SourceFinder interface used by the public reveals only a portion of the entire project  There is a separate interface to the web based forms that allows librarians to access and modify data in the SourceFinder database  Access to the database is password protected for security    Technical Details The SourceFinder application is simply a series of dynamic web pages created to access information stored in a database residing on the VMI Web server  Any change made to the database by a librarian is immediately reflected in the Web page that is generated by a subsequent user request  FrontPage 98 was used to generate the Web site and an Access database is being used to store the information  If you would like more information please contact David Somers  Development Team David Somers   Web Administrator Don Samdahl   Head Librarian Janet Holly   Reference Librarian David Hess   Head of Media Services Ken Winter   Reference Librarian Special thanks goes to Paul Adalian at the Robert E  Kennedy Library at California Polytechnic State University  San Luis Obispo  Paul developed the concept of a  study guide generator  and was a source of encouragement and support for our efforts to do the same  Updated  Tuesday  January 19  2010
