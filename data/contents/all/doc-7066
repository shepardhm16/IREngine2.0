This time honored tradition  the cornerstone of ROTC  has enabled the US Army to call upon thousands of soldiers   to lead   and fight  Army ROTC at VMI is the same today  cadets are selected for Active Duty tours of service in the US Army Reserve and the National Guard  Since its founding in 1839  VMI has required all cadets to study military science and tactics   By 1881  VMI had produced over twelve hundred graduates  and two hundred fifty nine former cadets were killed in battle  Most  of course  were slain during the Civil War  beginning with three men killed at Manassas  In 1891  the Board of Visitors succeeded in having Lieutenant John S  Parke detailed by the Army as a Professor of Military Science and Tactics  With one exception  the position of Professor of Military Science and tactics has historically been filled by graduates of VMI  War clouds appeared over Europe in 1914 and the storm eventually involved a reluctant United States in the conflict  Army officers at VMI once again began the task of preparing young men to lead in combat  A camp for military training was established on the VMI post  On 22 December 1916  the Superintendent officially notified all cadets of the recently passed Officers Reserve Act  This act  an integral part of the June 1916 National Defense Act  established Army ROTC and the three branches at VMI  Cavalry  Field Artillery  and Infantry  The Board of Visitors also included an Engineer Branch  All cadets were automatically assigned to the Infantry and those desiring to enter other branches took special examinations  By the year 1924  sufficient military equipment and supplies had been received that allowed the Corps of Cadets to form an infantry battalion  a cavalry troop  and a field artillery battery  In May 1943  the Army ROTC Department considerably revamped the curriculum and branch immaterial instruction replaced the three combat arms branches  World War II found the US Army ROTC Department once again preparing cadets for military service in a terrible and bloody conflict  On 1 November 1945  Artillery  Infantry  and Cavalry Branches were reinstated followed by an Army Air Corps ROTC option in 1946  Beginning in 1970  a flexible curriculum was allowed in response to changing educational concepts and philosophies  This new program delegated maximum authority to the Professor of Military Science  PMS  Broad guidance and policies were furnished  The detailed courses of instruction were programmed by the PMS in order to design a program compatible with the constantly evolving environment of the academic community  The final change in VMI s Army ROTC program occurred in September 1987 when branch related instruction was stopped  The program now focuses on leadership  instruction and teaching light Infantry individual and squad skills  The proud and long history of VMI Army ROTC culminated the formation of the Marshall New Market Battalion in September of 1989  Combining the name of VMI s most honored Army ROTC graduate with its most famous battle is indicative of the dignity  pride and professionalism felt by each cadet as they train to be future leaders  The Marshall New Market Battalion opened its doors in 1995 to a partnership program with Mary Baldwin College that included the Virginia Women s Institute for Leadership  This led to an expansion of the VMI ROTC program to include Washington and Lee University as well as Southern Virginia University  Today the battalion stands ready to produce the future leaders of tomorrow s Army  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
