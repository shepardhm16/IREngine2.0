EE223  Circuits II Home Teaching EE115 EE223 EE230 EE431 EE455 EE491 2 EE223  Electrical Circuit Analysis II  is the second course in a series designed to provide engineering majors the tools to analyze and design passive analog circuits  This course introduces capacitors and inductors  and develops the natural and forced responses of circuits containing these elements  It introduces complex phasor notation in the context of sinusoidal steady state analysis  and then further develops these concepts in the analysis of single and three phase AC power  The laboratory portion of the course introduces the practical skills of designing  building  and debugging physical circuits in the context of relevant contemporary examples  It includes a major design 4 lab sequence in which cadets design and build a project of their choice  Prerequisite  C or better in EE 122  Corequisite  MA311   3 lecture hours  2 lab hours  4 credit hours  Lecture Schedule In the following table  the readings and homework are assigned on the day listed and due on the following lesson  Some problem sets are downloaded below and completed by the student on graph paper  Others are links to online electronically graded problems that are due 10 minutes prior to the start of class   make sure you have saved your work by then  The e text  which is bundled with access to the online problems  is required and is available here for  60  If you prefer a printed text in addition  it is available in the bookstore    Date Title Read Homework   Handouts 1 2 Sep Integration review none Syllabus PS1 2

an authorized reference in all my exams  You can download a free pdf version  not authorized for my exams since you can t read it  directly from the NCEES website  and it is a good reference for homework  especially for integral equations  IC Datasheets  This is a listing of all common integrated circuits that we use in this course  as well as in entire curriculum at VMI  You may find it
