stirred up a desire to keep learning   and perhaps to participate in similar gatherings in the future   It s been a great experience working with Lt  Col   Brad  Coleman and the  Center for Leadership

of Cadets so they could attend these panels and miss class  explained Bajc  More than 300 cadets attended some portion of the conference  Bajc  who plans to commission in the Army upon graduation from VMI  cheerfully described himself as  the go to guy  during the gathering  filling in wherever needed  This morning  one of his major responsibilities was storing luggage for out of town guests so they could check out of their hotels before coming to post for the final day of the conference  Both cadets said they were grateful that their duties didn t prevent them from chatting with conference participants from a variety of backgrounds  or attending the many panels offered over the past two days   All of the speeches have been great  said Chiep   but the best part of this entire conference has been the opportunity to meet so many different people  The networking opportunities we ve had have been incredible  Bajc said that he d most enjoyed  looking at the Reagan administration and drawing conclusions for today  He continued   I just came from a panel on the Middle East  and there s so many connections there  between the Reagan administration s approach to problems and those taken by the U S  government today  We re fitting a lot of things into a global problem when maybe looking at things through a regional lens would be a better idea  Basc also praised the speech given last night by Jack F  Matlock Jr  former U S  ambassador to the Soviet Union   The Cold War wasn t really won by anyone  said Basc in recounting Matlock s speech   It was more of a collaborative effort between the U S  and the Soviets to end the Cold War together  Like Bajc  Chiep said that she d enjoyed learning more about an era that occurred before she or any of her fellow cadets were born   The Reagan administration had a great effect on politics today  said Chiep  who plans to commission in the Marine Corps upon graduation   It s been great learning how Cold War history connects to history today  The conference  it seems  has only stirred up a desire to keep learning   and perhaps to participate in similar gatherings in the future   It s been a great experience working with Lt  Col   Brad  Coleman and the  Center for Leadership and Ethics  and everyone who  s been involved  said Chiep   I have great hopes for any future conferences we have and the people we ll be working

the memories of the bombing of the U S  Marine Corps barracks in Beirut  Lebanon  on Oct  23  1983  are as fresh as if the event had occurred yesterday   for it was he who received the call from

referred to that October Sunday as  the saddest day of my life  Unknowingly  the Reagan administration had stepped into a simmering cauldron of ethnic and religious tensions fueled not only by the Lebanese themselves  but also the Soviet armed Syrians and the Israelis  anxious to protect their own territory and interests  By February 1984  the multi national peacekeeping force that had included the U S  troops was withdrawn from Lebanon   Lebanon is a harsh teacher  Brower noted  In a letter to columnist William F  Buckley in December 1983  Reagan wrote   The Middle East is a complicated
