materials  please contact Lieutenant Colonel Susan Hastings  hastingssf vmi edu  ext  7607  office located behind Preston Library s circulation desk  For traditional and electronic reserves  please indicate  Your name  The course number  for example  EN101  The loan period  options include 2 hours  overnight  and 2 days  The duration of the course  for example  spring 2005  The date by which your students will need the material  When you expect to use the materials again  Electronic Reserves Materials are made available through electronic reserves only when their use is determined to be a Fair Use under the provisions of Copyright Law  Each item available electronically has a paper backup copy on reserve at the circulation desk  Guidelines for documents to be scanned  Use a paperclip  not a staple  to keep the document together   We have to remove staples to feed the document through the scanner  and the holes can cause a paper jam  Please provide a complete citation  including the copyright statement  usually found adjacent to the publisher information for serials or on the verso of the title page for monographs  Please note that color illustrations are often hard to see when copied in black and white   If the content of color illustrations is critical  please speak to circulation staff about alternatives  If you provide a photocopy  please make it as straight as possible   We are not able to straighten a copy that is slightly crooked on the page  If you provide a photocopy  please do not make it too dark   Dark copies appear fuzzy and hard to read after scanning  If you provide a photocopy of two pages side by side  please try to keep the shadow from the spine as light as possible   We can crop away dark edges but not a dark area in the center of the page  Additional information about class notes  homework solutions  etc  Please write a logical  consistent title as the first line of the first page   We will adapt this first line as the document s title  which your student will use to make a selection from the list of documents on reserve  It is a good practice for the first line of the document retrieved to match the title that the student has selected  Let us know if you would like your documents listed in a special order  for example  by unit numbers  date  etc   We can begin the title we assign with a unit number or assignment date  if you like  Leave a margin of at least a quarter inch on each side of the page   Otherwise  some of the text may be cut off  Write legibly   If your writing is too small or messy  students will not be able to read and understand your text  Use a writing instrument with a normal  not too fine  point   A fine point may make lines that are too light to be scanned legibly  Use unlined paper of a normal weight   Notebook paper is too flimsy to feed through the scanner  Write on only one side of the paper   If you write on both sides  one side  bleeds through  to the other  and the result is not legible  We make every effort to make materials available in a timely and reliable fashion  If you have any questions or concerns  please do not hesitate to discuss them with circulation staff  VMI
