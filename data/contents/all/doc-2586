self regulatory mechanism of the higher education community  It plays a significant role in fostering public confidence in the educational enterprise  maintaining standards  enhancing institutional effectiveness  and improving higher education by establishing a common set of requirements with which accredited institutions must comply  Accreditation by the Commission on Colleges signifies that the institution  1  has a mission appropriate to higher education   2  has resources  programs  and services sufficient to accomplish and sustain that mission  and  3  maintains clearly specified educational objectives that are consistent with its mission and appropriate to the degrees it offers and that indicate whether it is successful in achieving its stated objectives  The Process for Reaffirmation The process for initial  and continued  accreditation involves a collective analysis and judgment by the institution s internal constituencies  an informed review by peers external to the institution  and a reasoned decision by the elected members of the Commission on Colleges Board of Trustees  Accredited institutions periodically conduct internal reviews involving their administrative officers  staffs  faculties  students  trustees  and others appropriate to the process  The internal review allows an institution to consider its effectiveness in achieving its stated mission  its compliance with the Commission s accreditation requirements  its efforts in enhancing the quality of student learning and the quality of programs and services offered to its constituencies  and its success in accomplishing its mission  At the culmination of the internal review  peer evaluators representing the Commission apply their professional judgment through a preliminary assessment of the institution  elected Board Members make the final determination of an institution s compliance with the accreditation requirements  Application of the Requirements The Commission on Colleges bases its accreditation of degree granting higher education institutions and entities on requirements in the Principles of Accreditation  Foundations for Quality Enhancement  These requirements apply to all institutional programs and services  wherever located or however delivered  This includes programs offered through distance and correspondence education  off campus sites  and branch campuses  Consequently  when preparing documents for the Commission demonstrating compliance with the Principles of Accreditation  an institution must include these programs in its  Institutional Summary Form Prepared for Commission Reviews  and address these programs in its analysis and documentation of compliance   See Commission policy  Distance and Correspondence Education  The Commission on Colleges applies the requirements of its Principles to all applicant  candidate  and member institutions  regardless of the type of institution  private for profit  private not for profit  or public  The Commission evaluates an institution and makes accreditation decisions based on the following  Compliance with the Principle of Integrity  Section 1  Compliance with the Core Requirements  Section 2  Compliance with the Comprehensive Standards  Section 3  Compliance with additional Federal Requirements  Section 4  Compliance with the policies of the Commission on Colleges  See Appendix for definition  description  and reference to policies  Access Commission s Web page  www sacscoc org  Components of the Review Process The Commission conducts several types of institutional reviews   1  Candidate  Committee reviews of institutions seeking candidacy   2  Accreditation Committee reviews  of candidate institutions seeking initial membership   3  Reaffirmation Committee reviews of member institutions seeking continued accreditation following a comprehensive review   4  Special Committee reviews of member institutions seeking continued  accreditation following evaluation of institutional circumstances that are accreditation related  and  5  Substantive  Change Committee reviews of member institutions seeking  approval  and continued  accreditation following  the review  of a change of a significant  modification or expansion to the institution s nature and scope  Each of the above types of reviews has its own evaluation documents and peer review procedures and can be found on the Commission s Web site  www sacscoc org  The process described below is specific to a member institution seeking reaffirmation of accreditation  Preparation by the Institution As part of the reaffirmation process  the institution will provide two separate documents  1  Compliance Certification The Compliance Certification  submitted approximately fifteen months in advance of an institution s scheduled reaffirmation  is a document completed by the institution that demonstrates its judgment of the extent of its compliance with each of the Core Requirements  Comprehensive Standards  and Federal Requirements  Signatures by the institution s chief executive officer and accreditation liaison are required to certify compliance  By signing the document  the individuals certify that the process of institutional self  assessment has been thorough  honest  and forthright  and that the information contained in the document is truthful  accurate  and complete  2  Quality Enhancement Plan The Quality Enhancement  Plan  QEP  submitted four to six weeks in advance of the on site review by the Commission  is a document developed by the institution that  1  includes a process identifying key  issues emerging  from institutional assessment   2  focuses on learning outcomes and or the environment supporting  student learning and accomplishing the mission of the institution   3  demonstrates institutional capability for the initiation  implementation  and completion of the QEP   4  includes broad based involvement of institutional constituencies in the development and proposed implementation of the QEP  and  5  identifies  goals and a plan to assess their achievement  The QEP should be focused  and succinct  no more than seventy five  pages of narrative text and no more than twenty  five pages of supporting  documentation or charts  graphs  and tables  Review by the Commission on Colleges 1  The Off Site Review The Off Site Reaffirmation Committee  composed of a chair and normally  eight to ten evaluators  meets in Atlanta  Georgia  and reviews Compliance Certifications of a group of institutions to determine whether  each  institution is in  compliance  with  all  Core Requirements  except Core Requirement 2 12  Comprehensive Standards  except Comprehensive Standard 3 3 2  and Federal Requirements  The group of institutions evaluated  called a cluster  consists of no more than three institutions similar in governance and degrees offered  At the conclusion of the review  the Off Site Reaffirmation Committee will prepare a separate report for each institution  recording and explaining its decisions regarding compliance  The report is forwarded to the respective institution s On Site Reaffirmation Committee which makes its final determination on compliance  2  The On Site Review Following review by the Off Site Reaffirmation Committee  an On  Site Reaffirmation Committee will conduct a focused evaluation at the campus to finalize issues of compliance  with the Core Requirements  Comprehensive Standards  and Federal Requirements  provide consultation regarding the issues addressed in the QEP  and evaluate the acceptability of the QEP  At the conclusion of its visit  the On Site Committee will finalize the Report of the Reaffirmation Committee  a written report of its findings noting areas of non compliance  including the acceptability of the QEP  The Report of the Reaffirmation Committee  along with the institution s response to areas of non compliance  will be forwarded to the Commission s Board of Trustees for review and action on reaffirmation   3  Review by the Commission s Board of Trustees The Committees on Compliance and Reports  C   R
