 William Couper  The book contains biographical sketches of all of the cadets who fought at New Market  as well as other information about the battle  Couper  1884 1964  VMI s  official historiographer  wrote extensively about Institute history  Battlefield Map  This is referred to in the text as the  Colonna Morgan  map Conditions which caused the Battle General Franz Sigel s march up the Shenandoah Valley from Winchester to New Market  Va  in May  1864  had  as its objective point  the town of Staunton  where he could cut the Virginia Central Railroad  Now the C    O  Ry  and thus deprive General Lee s army and Richmond of one of their chief sources of supply  and whence he might  eventually  force his way to the rear of General Lee s army  then south of the Rappahannock River  The only Confederate States force in the Valley  in May  1864  was that of Gen  J  D  Imboden  consisting of cavalry  mounted infantry  and a battery of six guns  aggregating about 1 500 men  When Imboden heard of Sigel s advance  about May 2nd  he notified the Superintendent of the V  M  I  to hold the Corps of Cadets in readiness to reinforce his little army  As the Valley of Virginia was  in May  1864  in the military department of Gen  John C  Breckinridge  C S A  who was then in Southwest Virginia  he at once assumed active command of the Confederate States forces for the defense of the Valley  And owing to the small number of Breckinridge s available forces  the Corps of Cadets was ordered  on May 10th  to join Breckinridge s Southwest Virginia forces at Staunton  from which point  the whole force could march down the Valley to join Imboden  or to which point  Imboden could fall back to join Breckinridge  either of which movements would necessitate a battle in the upper half of the Shenandoah Valley  The March to New Market The cadets were awakened by the long roll on the night of May 10th  and ordered to march early the next morning on the road to Staunton  On Wednesday morning  May 11th the corps left barracks and marched all day over the old Staunton road   always in bad condition  especially in the rainy season  to the town of Midway  about 18 miles north of Lexington  and went into camp  sleeping in the rain that night  On May 12th  the corps marched  in a drenching rain  through mud and water  to Staunton    about 18 miles  On May 13th  the corps  having joined Breckinridge s veterans in Staunton  marched some 18 or 20 miles down the Valley Pike to a point south of Harrisonburg  On May 14th  the corps continued down the pike  through Harrisonburg  to within about 7 miles of New Market  a march of about 15 miles  and went into camp in a body of woods on the east side of the pike  On the 14th  there was some skirmishing and an artillery duel between Sigel s advance column and Imboden north of New Market  On Sunday  May l5th  about 1 a  m  a pitch dark and rainy night  the cadets were quietly aroused  and after a prayer by Capt  Frank Preston  B Co  the corps commenced its march to the battle field  but it did not reach the vicinity of New Market until some time after sun rise  because of one or more protracted stops    The Cadets in Action  The corps  after marching and waiting on the pike for probably 10 hours   the battle proper having commenced about 11 a m  was marched by column by the left flank from the pike to a point south of  Shirley s Hill  about one mile south of New Market  and was there  for the first time  formed into line of battle behind a fence at right angles to the pike   See map  south west corner  The corps then advanced north  in line of battle in the third and last echelon  over the crest of Shirley s Hill  As the United States batteries did not get the range of the corps  until it reached the north slope of Shirley s Hill on its descent to the  River Road  there were no casualties up to that point  But on the descent   probably somewhere near the present barn  Capt  Hill  of C Co  and Corporal J  S  Wise  of D Co  and several others were wounded by the explosion of one or more United States shells  This was the corps baptism of blood  In the ravine north of Shirley s Hill  near  River Road  the cadets were halted and made to discard their blankets  etc  And here they saw  for the first time  a sight which amazed them more than the carnage of battle  The officers of the veteran command  composing the second echelon  almost in front of the corps  when their regiment was ordered to advance  had to force the skulkers into ranks at the points of their pistols  The delay in the ravine  while seemingly quite long  is said to have been only a half hour  This was the lull before the storm  for the second or hottest part of the battle commenced between 1 and 2 p  m  It was probably during this interval  or a little earlier  that Imboden crossed over to the east side of Smith s Creek  with the intention of re crossing it to the pike side  in order to turn Sigel s left flank  but the high water in the creek prevented him from consummating this movement  After ascending the south end of the  Bushong  plateau   which extends about one mile north to the Bushong House  a march in line of battle of one quarter to one half mile over this open and comparatively level ground  brought the corps within easy range of the three United States six gun batteries on the top of the  Bushong Hill  A glance at the map will show that Sigel s last position was the very strongest he could have taken  as it filled the narrow neck between the Shenandoah River and Smith s Creek  both of which were practically unfordable from the recent rains  This line  of almost one mile in length  with 18 guns on its right flank and four on its left  had to be charged and driven from its position  in order to win the battle  When the corps reached the point several hundred yards south of the Bushong House  it was subjected to  a terrible fire of artillery  Here  CABELL  first Sergeant D Co  and JONES and CROCKETT privates D Co   fell dead from the explosion of one shell  Here also  but possibly a little farther back  the corps came within range of the United States musketry fire  Almost immediately after the explosion of the shell in D Co  McDOWELL  private B Co   fell  pierced through the heart with a bullet  The corps marched steadily and continuously over this open plateau up to the south front of the Bushong House through  mud  in many places over the ankles  a portion of the time being under both artillery and musketry fire  the alignment of the battalion was like that on parade  the gaps in the ranks  caused by the killed and wounded men  were filled automatically  as if nothing unusual had happened  and at no time did the corps  battle line even waver  When the corps reached the Bushong House  which was near the center of its line of march  it divided in half  A and B Companies passing it on the east side  and C and D Companies on the west  This necessarily broke the previous alignment  which was never fully restored  This movement brought the whole corps into the Bushong orchard  say from 50 to 100 yards in width  where it came within from 200 to 300 yards of the three United States batteries on the top of the Bushong Hill  which  poured incessant volleys of canister and grape into us  to this incessant fire of artillery  must be added the musketry fire of the 34th Mass  Infantry  immediately in front of the corps   In this fatal orchard  STANARD and JEFFERSON  privates B Co  fell mortally wounded   and  in fact  almost all our loss was here  including Col  Scott Shipp  in command of the corps  who was wounded  Capt  Henry A  Wise  of A Co  then took command  and retained it until the end of the battle  The deadly fire of shells  grape  canister and bullets  to which the corps was subjected in the Bushong Orchard  did not cause it to retreat  or even to fall back temporarily  but the cadets  ran forward  to the remains of a demolished rail fence on the north edge of the orchard   laid down behind the fence  and began  for the first time  to fire upon the enemy  the corps  by its rapid advance  having just gotten into the first line of battle and filled a gap  caused by the change of position of one or more other commands  Unfortunately  this position of the corps is not given by Prof  Turner on the Colonna Morgan Map  though it is  by far  the most important one held by the corps during the entire battle  since it filled a wide gap at a critical moment  Beyond question  this was the crisis of the battle  The 51st Virginia Regiment on the left flank of the corps gave way  and had to be rallied  And about this time  say 3 p  m  possibly a quarter of an hour earlier  the 62nd Va  Reg  on the right flank of the corps  while advancing in the rocky field just northeast of the Bushong House  had to fall back to prevent annihilation  Position 19 was evidently the most fatal spot on the battle field  for Capt  Woodson s Missouri Co   attached temporarily to the 62nd Va  lost 60 out of 70 men  or 85 percent  in killed and wounded  The stop of the corps at the orchard fence could not have been over 15 or 20 minutes  But whether long or short  it was the period of the greatest anxiety  during the day  to both officers and men  because it seemed that the next move  on either side would probably determine the result of the battle  and this proved to be correct  For Col  Edgar  an old V  M  I  graduate  commanding the 26th Va  Battalion  had succeeded in turning the United States right flank on the top of Bushong s Hill  The success of this movement stopped the artillery fire and lessened the musketry fire against the corps  and probably against the 51st and 62nd Va  and speedily caused the United States line in front and to the left of the corps to break and retreat  When the heavy artillery fire ceased  the command was given to the corps to charge  This order was obeyed  not only with alacrity  but with enthusiasm   and though the company organizations were gone  yet they rallied round the colors and formed some sort of a line as we advanced  So eager were the cadets to charge the enemy  100 or 150 yards off  that it was difficult for them to find time to load and shoot their old fashioned muzzle loading muskets This  the final charge  commenced in the wheat field  then a field of mud  just north of the Bushong Orchard  and continued for some distance north towards the Pike bridge over the Shenandoah  The pursuit of the retreating army by the cadets continued until the corps  was halted by order of General Breckinridge  The company organizations and the parade alignment of the corps were never completely restored after the pursuit commenced  The battle proper ended about 4 p  m  though there was some cannonading later in the day on Rude s Hill  about three miles north of the town  It is a question of some doubt  whether any of the nine cadets  who were killed or mortally wounded  fell in this final charge  though a few of the cadets are said to have been wounded after the corps left the Bushong fence  The writer regrets that he cannot locate  with any degree of accuracy  the points where Corporal ATWILL  A Co  Private HAYNES  B Co  and private WHEELWRIGHT  C Co  fell  but he presumes that all three were killed or mortally wounded

quite long  is said to have been only a half hour  This was the lull before the storm  for the second or hottest part of the battle commenced between 1 and 2 p  m  It was probably during this interval  or a little earlier  that Imboden crossed over to the east side of Smith s Creek  with the intention of re crossing it to the pike side  in order to turn Sigel s left flank  but the high water in the creek prevented him from consummating this movement  After ascending the south end of the  Bushong  plateau   which extends about one mile north to the Bushong House  a march in line of battle of one quarter to one half mile over this open and comparatively level ground  brought the corps within easy range of the three United States six gun batteries on the top of the  Bushong Hill  A glance at the map will show that Sigel s last position was the very strongest he could have taken  as it filled the narrow neck between the Shenandoah River and Smith s Creek  both of which were practically unfordable from the recent rains  This line  of almost one mile in length  with 18 guns on its right flank and four on its left  had to be charged and driven from its position  in order to win the battle  When the corps reached the point several hundred yards south of the Bushong House  it was subjected to  a terrible fire of artillery  Here  CABELL  first Sergeant D Co  and JONES and CROCKETT privates D Co   fell dead from the explosion of one shell  Here also  but possibly a little farther back  the corps came within range of the United States musketry fire  Almost immediately after the explosion of the shell in D Co  McDOWELL  private B Co   fell  pierced through the heart with a bullet  The corps marched steadily and continuously over this open plateau up to the south front of the Bushong House through  mud  in many places over the ankles  a portion of the time being under both artillery and musketry fire  the alignment of the battalion was like that on parade  the gaps in the ranks  caused by the killed and wounded men  were filled automatically  as if nothing unusual had happened  and at no time did the corps  battle line even waver  When the corps reached the Bushong House  which was near the center of its line of march  it divided in half  A and B Companies passing it on the east side  and C and D Companies on the west  This necessarily broke the previous alignment  which was never fully restored  This movement brought the whole corps into the Bushong orchard  say from 50 to 100 yards in width  where it came within from 200 to 300 yards of the three United States batteries on the top of the Bushong Hill  which  poured incessant volleys of canister and grape into us  to this incessant fire of artillery  must be added the musketry fire of the 34th Mass  Infantry  immediately in front of the corps   In this fatal orchard  STANARD and JEFFERSON  privates B Co  fell mortally wounded   and  in fact  almost all our loss was here  including Col  Scott Shipp  in command of the corps  who was wounded  Capt  Henry A  Wise  of A Co  then took command  and retained it until the end of the battle  The deadly fire of shells  grape  canister and bullets  to which the corps was subjected in the Bushong Orchard  did not cause it to retreat  or even to fall back temporarily  but the cadets  ran forward  to the remains of a demolished rail fence on the north edge of the orchard   laid down behind the fence  and began  for the first time  to fire upon the enemy  the corps  by its rapid advance  having just gotten into the first line of battle and filled a gap  caused by the change of position of one or more other commands  Unfortunately  this position of the corps is not given by Prof  Turner on the Colonna Morgan Map  though it is  by far  the most important one held by the corps during the entire battle  since it filled a wide gap at a critical moment  Beyond question  this was the crisis of the battle  The 51st Virginia Regiment on the left flank of the corps gave way  and had to be rallied  And about this time  say 3 p  m  possibly a quarter of an hour earlier  the 62nd Va  Reg  on the right flank of the corps  while advancing in the rocky field just northeast of the Bushong House  had to fall back to prevent annihilation  Position 19 was evidently the most fatal spot on the battle field  for Capt  Woodson s Missouri Co   attached temporarily to the 62nd Va  lost 60 out of 70 men  or 85 percent  in killed and wounded  The stop of the corps at the orchard fence could not have been over 15 or 20 minutes  But whether long or short  it was the period of the greatest anxiety  during the day  to both officers and men  because it seemed that the next move  on either side would probably determine the result of the battle  and this proved to be correct  For Col  Edgar  an old V  M  I  graduate  commanding the 26th Va  Battalion  had succeeded in turning the United States right flank on the top of Bushong s Hill  The success of this movement stopped the artillery fire and lessened the musketry fire against the corps  and probably against the 51st and 62nd Va  and speedily caused the United States line in front and to the left of the corps to break and retreat  When the heavy artillery fire ceased  the command was given to the corps to charge  This order was obeyed  not only with alacrity  but with enthusiasm   and though the company organizations were gone  yet they rallied round the colors and formed some sort of a line as we advanced  So eager were the cadets to charge the enemy  100 or 150 yards off  that it was difficult for them to find time to load and shoot their old fashioned muzzle loading muskets This  the final charge  commenced in the wheat field  then a field of mud  just north of the Bushong Orchard  and continued for some distance north towards the Pike bridge over the Shenandoah  The pursuit of the retreating army by the cadets continued until the corps  was halted by order of General Breckinridge  The company organizations and the parade alignment of the corps were never completely restored after the pursuit commenced  The battle proper ended about 4 p  m  though there was some cannonading later in the day on Rude s Hill  about three miles north of the town  It is a question of some doubt  whether any of the nine cadets  who were killed or mortally wounded  fell in this final charge  though a few of the cadets are said to have been wounded after the corps left the Bushong fence  The writer regrets that he cannot locate  with any degree of accuracy  the points where Corporal ATWILL  A Co  Private HAYNES  B Co  and private WHEELWRIGHT  C Co  fell  but he presumes that all three were killed or mortally wounded in  the fatal orchard  VMI Foundation Keydet Club

 The Battle of New Market  Virginia  May 15  1864  Summary  New Market top level  The following text is from The VMI New Market Cadets  1933  by Col  William Couper  The book contains biographical sketches of all of the cadets who fought at New Market  as well as other information about the battle  Couper  1884 1964  VMI s  official historiographer  wrote extensively about Institute history  Battlefield Map  This is referred to in the text as the  Colonna Morgan  map Conditions which caused the Battle General Franz Sigel s march up the Shenandoah Valley from Winchester to New Market  Va  in May  1864  had  as its objective point  the town of Staunton  where he could cut the Virginia Central Railroad  Now the C    O  Ry  and thus deprive General Lee s army and Richmond of one of their chief sources of supply  and whence he might  eventually  force his way to the rear of General Lee s army  then south of the Rappahannock River  The only Confederate States force in the Valley  in May  1864  was that of Gen  J  D  Imboden  consisting of cavalry  mounted infantry  and a battery of six guns  aggregating about 1 500 men  When Imboden heard of Sigel s advance  about May 2nd  he notified the Superintendent of the V  M  I  to hold the Corps of Cadets in readiness to reinforce his little army  As the Valley of Virginia was  in May  1864  in the military department of Gen  John C  Breckinridge  C S A  who was then in Southwest Virginia  he at once assumed active command of the Confederate States forces for the defense of the Valley  And owing to the small number of Breckinridge s available forces  the Corps of Cadets was ordered  on May 10th  to join Breckinridge s Southwest Virginia forces at Staunton  from which point  the whole force could march down the Valley to join Imboden  or to which point  Imboden could fall back to join Breckinridge  either of which movements would necessitate a battle in the upper half of the Shenandoah Valley  The March to New Market The cadets were awakened by the long roll on the night of May 10th  and ordered to march early the next morning on the road to Staunton  On Wednesday morning  May 11th the corps left barracks and marched all day over the old Staunton road   always in bad condition  especially in the rainy season  to the town of Midway  about 18 miles north of Lexington  and went into camp  sleeping in the rain that night  On May 12th  the corps marched  in a drenching rain  through mud and water  to Staunton    about 18 miles  On May 13th  the corps  having joined Breckinridge s veterans in Staunton  marched some 18 or 20 miles down the Valley Pike to a point south of Harrisonburg  On May 14th  the corps continued down the pike  through Harrisonburg  to within about 7 miles of New Market  a march of about 15 miles  and went into camp in a body of woods on the east side of the pike  On the 14th  there was some skirmishing and an artillery duel between Sigel s advance column and Imboden north of New Market  On Sunday  May l5th  about 1 a  m  a pitch dark and rainy night  the cadets were quietly aroused  and after a prayer by Capt  Frank Preston  B Co  the corps commenced its march to the battle field  but it did not reach the vicinity of New Market until some time after sun rise  because of one or more protracted stops    The Cadets in Action  The corps  after marching and waiting on the pike for probably 10 hours   the battle proper having commenced about 11 a m  was marched by column by the left flank from the pike to a point south of  Shirley s Hill  about one mile south of New Market  and was there  for the first time  formed into line of battle behind a fence at right angles to the pike   See map  south west corner  The corps then advanced north  in line of battle in the third and last echelon  over the crest of Shirley s Hill  As the United States batteries did not get the range of the corps  until it reached the north slope of Shirley s Hill on its descent to the  River Road  there were no casualties up to that point  But on the descent   probably somewhere near the present barn  Capt  Hill  of C Co  and Corporal J  S  Wise  of D Co  and several others were wounded by the explosion of one or more United States shells  This was the corps baptism of blood  In the ravine north of Shirley s Hill  near  River Road  the cadets were halted and made to discard their blankets  etc  And here they saw  for the first time  a sight which amazed them more than the carnage of battle  The officers of the veteran command  composing the second echelon  almost in front of the corps  when their regiment was ordered to advance  had to force the skulkers into ranks at the points of their pistols  The delay in the ravine  while seemingly quite long  is said to have been only a half hour  This was the lull before the storm  for the second or hottest part of the battle commenced between 1 and 2 p  m  It was probably during this interval

Corporal ATWILL  A Co  Private HAYNES  B Co  and private WHEELWRIGHT  C Co  fell  but he presumes that all three were killed or mortally wounded in  the fatal orchard  VMI Foundation Keydet Club

Summary  New Market top level  The following text is from The VMI New Market Cadets  1933  by Col  William Couper  The book contains biographical sketches of all of the cadets who fought at New Market  as well as other information about the battle  Couper  1884 1964  VMI s  official historiographer  wrote extensively about Institute history  Battlefield Map  This is referred to in the text as the  Colonna Morgan  map Conditions which caused the Battle General Franz Sigel s march up the Shenandoah Valley from Winchester to New Market  Va  in May  1864  had  as its objective point  the town of Staunton  where he could cut the Virginia Central Railroad  Now the C    O  Ry  and thus deprive General Lee s army and Richmond of one of their chief sources of supply  and whence he might  eventually  force his way to the rear of General Lee s army  then south of the Rappahannock River  The only Confederate States force in the Valley  in May  1864  was that of Gen  J  D  Imboden  consisting of cavalry  mounted infantry  and a battery of six guns  aggregating about 1 500 men  When Imboden heard of Sigel s advance  about May 2nd  he notified the Superintendent of the V  M  I  to hold the Corps of Cadets in readiness to reinforce his little army  As the Valley of Virginia was  in May  1864  in the military department of Gen  John C  Breckinridge  C S A  who was then in Southwest Virginia  he at once assumed active command of the Confederate States forces for the defense of the Valley  And owing to the small number of Breckinridge s available forces  the Corps of Cadets was ordered  on May 10th  to join Breckinridge s Southwest Virginia forces at Staunton  from which point  the whole force could march down the Valley to join Imboden  or to which point  Imboden could fall back to join Breckinridge  either of which movements would necessitate a battle in the upper half of the Shenandoah Valley  The March to New Market The cadets were awakened by the long roll on the night of May 10th  and ordered to march early the next morning on the road to Staunton  On Wednesday morning  May 11th the corps left barracks and marched all day over the old Staunton road   always in bad condition  especially in the rainy season  to the town of Midway  about 18 miles north of Lexington  and went into camp  sleeping in the rain that night  On May 12th  the corps marched  in a drenching rain  through mud and water  to Staunton    about 18 miles  On May 13th  the corps  having joined Breckinridge s veterans in Staunton  marched some 18 or 20 miles down the Valley Pike to a point south of Harrisonburg  On May 14th  the corps continued down the pike  through Harrisonburg  to within about 7 miles of New Market  a march of about 15 miles  and went into camp in a body of woods on the east side of the pike  On the 14th  there was some skirmishing and an artillery duel between Sigel s advance column and Imboden north of New Market  On Sunday  May l5th  about 1 a  m  a pitch dark and rainy night  the cadets were quietly aroused  and after a prayer by Capt  Frank Preston  B Co  the corps commenced its march to the battle field  but it did not reach the vicinity of New Market until some time after sun rise  because of one or more protracted stops    The Cadets in Action  The corps  after marching and waiting on the pike for probably 10 hours   the battle proper having commenced about 11 a m  was marched by column by the left flank from the pike to a point south of  Shirley s Hill  about one mile south of New Market  and was there  for the first time  formed into line of battle behind a fence at right angles to the pike   See map  south west corner  The corps then advanced north  in line of battle in the third and last echelon  over the crest of Shirley s Hill  As the United States batteries did not get the range of the corps  until it reached the north slope of Shirley s Hill on its descent to the  River Road  there were no casualties up to that point  But on the descent   probably somewhere near the present barn  Capt  Hill  of C Co  and Corporal J  S  Wise  of D Co  and several others were wounded by the explosion of one or more United States shells  This was the corps baptism of blood  In the ravine north of Shirley s Hill  near  River Road  the cadets were halted and made to discard their blankets  etc  And here they saw  for the first time  a sight which amazed them more than the carnage of battle  The officers of the veteran command  composing the second echelon  almost in front of the corps  when their regiment was ordered to advance  had to force the skulkers into ranks at the points of their pistols  The delay in the ravine  while seemingly quite long  is said to have been only a half hour  This was the lull before the storm  for the second or hottest part of the battle commenced between 1 and 2 p  m  It was probably during this interval  or a little earlier  that Imboden crossed over to the east side of Smith s Creek  with the intention of re crossing it to the pike side  in order to turn Sigel s left flank  but the high water in the creek prevented him from consummating this movement  After ascending the south end of the  Bushong  plateau   which extends about one mile north to the Bushong House  a march in line of battle of one quarter to one half mile over this open and comparatively level ground  brought the corps within easy range of the three United States six gun batteries on the top of the  Bushong Hill  A glance at the map will show that Sigel s last position was the very strongest he could have taken  as it filled the narrow neck between the Shenandoah River and Smith s Creek  both of which were practically unfordable from the recent rains  This line  of almost one mile in length  with 18 guns on its right flank and four on its left  had to be charged and driven from its position  in order to win the battle  When the corps reached the point several hundred yards south of the Bushong House  it was subjected to  a terrible fire of artillery  Here  CABELL  first Sergeant D Co  and JONES and CROCKETT privates D Co   fell dead from the explosion of one shell  Here also  but possibly a little farther back  the corps came within range of the United States musketry fire  Almost immediately after the explosion of the shell in D Co  McDOWELL  private B Co   fell  pierced through the heart with a bullet  The corps marched steadily and continuously over this open plateau up to the south front of the Bushong House through  mud  in many places over the ankles  a portion of the time being under both artillery and musketry fire  the alignment of the battalion was like that on parade  the gaps in the ranks  caused by the killed and wounded men  were filled automatically  as if nothing unusual had happened  and at no time did the corps  battle line even waver  When the corps reached the Bushong House  which was near the center of its line of march  it divided in half  A and B Companies passing it on the east side  and C and D Companies on the west  This necessarily broke the previous alignment  which was never fully restored  This movement brought the whole corps into the Bushong orchard  say from 50 to 100 yards in width  where it came within from 200 to 300 yards of the three United States batteries on the top of the Bushong Hill  which  poured incessant volleys of canister and grape into us  to this incessant fire of artillery  must be added the musketry fire of the 34th Mass  Infantry  immediately in front of the corps   In this fatal orchard  STANARD and JEFFERSON  privates B Co  fell mortally wounded   and  in fact  almost all our loss was here  including Col  Scott Shipp  in command of the corps  who was wounded  Capt  Henry A  Wise  of A Co  then took command  and retained it until the end of the battle  The deadly fire of shells  grape  canister and bullets  to which the corps was subjected in the Bushong Orchard  did not cause it to retreat  or even to fall back temporarily  but the cadets  ran forward  to the remains of a demolished rail fence on the north edge of the orchard   laid down behind the fence  and began  for the first time  to fire upon the enemy  the corps  by its rapid advance  having just gotten into the first line of battle and filled a gap  caused by the change of position of one or more other commands  Unfortunately  this position of the corps is not given by Prof  Turner on the Colonna Morgan Map  though it is  by far  the most important one held by the corps during the entire battle  since it filled a wide gap at a critical moment  Beyond question  this was the crisis of the battle  The 51st Virginia Regiment on the left flank of the corps gave way  and had to be rallied  And about this time  say 3 p  m  possibly a quarter of an hour earlier  the 62nd Va  Reg  on the right flank of the corps  while advancing in the rocky field just northeast of the Bushong House  had to fall back to prevent annihilation  Position 19 was evidently the most fatal spot on the battle field  for Capt  Woodson s Missouri Co   attached temporarily to the 62nd Va  lost 60 out of 70 men  or 85 percent  in killed and wounded  The stop of the corps at the orchard fence could not have been over 15 or 20 minutes  But whether long or short  it was the period of the greatest anxiety  during the day  to both officers and men  because it seemed that the next move  on either side would probably determine the result of the battle  and this proved to be correct  For Col  Edgar  an old V  M  I  graduate  commanding the 26th Va  Battalion  had succeeded in turning the United States right flank on the top of Bushong s Hill  The success of this movement stopped the artillery fire and lessened the musketry fire against the corps  and probably against the 51st and 62nd Va  and speedily caused the United States line in front and to the left of the corps to break and retreat  When the heavy artillery fire ceased  the command was given to the corps to charge  This order was obeyed  not only with alacrity  but with enthusiasm   and though the company organizations were gone  yet they rallied round the colors and formed some sort of a line as we advanced  So eager were the cadets to charge the enemy  100 or 150 yards off  that it was difficult for them to find time to load and shoot their old fashioned muzzle loading muskets This  the final charge  commenced in the wheat field  then a field of mud  just north of the Bushong Orchard  and continued for some distance north towards the Pike bridge over the Shenandoah  The pursuit of the retreating army by the cadets continued until the corps  was halted by order of General Breckinridge  The company organizations and the parade alignment of the corps were never completely restored after the pursuit commenced  The battle proper ended about 4 p  m  though there was some cannonading later in the day on Rude s Hill  about three miles north of the town  It is a question of some doubt  whether any of the nine cadets  who were killed or mortally wounded  fell in this final charge  though a few of the cadets are said to have been wounded after the corps left the Bushong fence  The writer regrets that he cannot locate  with any degree of accuracy  the points where Corporal ATWILL  A Co  Private HAYNES  B Co  and private WHEELWRIGHT  C Co  fell  but he presumes that all three were killed or mortally wounded in  the fatal orchard Archives Home Digital Collections Archives Online Catalog Quick Info  FAQs Civil

rallied round the colors and formed some sort of a line as we advanced  So eager were the cadets to charge the enemy  100 or 150 yards off  that it was difficult for them to find time to load and shoot their old fashioned muzzle loading muskets This  the final charge  commenced in the wheat field  then a field of mud  just north of the Bushong Orchard  and continued for some distance north towards the Pike bridge over the Shenandoah  The pursuit of the retreating army by the cadets continued until the corps  was halted by order of General Breckinridge  The company organizations and the parade alignment of the corps were never completely restored after the pursuit commenced  The battle proper ended about 4 p  m  though there was some cannonading later in the day on Rude s Hill  about three miles north of the town  It is a question of some doubt  whether any of the nine cadets  who were killed or mortally wounded  fell in this final charge  though a few of the cadets are said to have been wounded after the corps left the Bushong fence  The writer regrets that he cannot locate  with any degree of accuracy  the points where Corporal ATWILL  A Co  Private HAYNES  B Co  and

General Franz Sigel s march up the Shenandoah Valley from Winchester to New Market  Va  in May  1864  had  as its objective point  the town of Staunton  where he could cut the Virginia Central Railroad  Now the C    O  Ry  and thus deprive General Lee s army and Richmond of one of their chief sources of supply  and whence he might  eventually  force his way to the rear of General Lee s army  then south of the Rappahannock River  The only Confederate States force in the Valley  in May  1864  was that of Gen  J  D  Imboden  consisting of cavalry  mounted infantry  and a battery of six guns  aggregating about 1 500 men  When Imboden heard of Sigel s advance  about May 2nd  he notified the Superintendent of the V  M  I  to hold the Corps of Cadets in readiness to reinforce his little army  As the Valley of Virginia was  in May  1864  in the military department of Gen  John C  Breckinridge  C S A  who was then in Southwest Virginia  he at once assumed active command of the Confederate States forces for the defense of the Valley  And owing to the small number of Breckinridge s available forces  the Corps of Cadets was ordered  on May 10th  to join Breckinridge s Southwest Virginia forces at Staunton  from which point  the whole force could march down the Valley to join Imboden  or to which point  Imboden could fall back to join Breckinridge  either of which movements would necessitate a battle in the upper half of the Shenandoah Valley  The March to New Market The cadets were awakened by the long roll on the night of May 10th  and ordered to march early the next morning on the road to Staunton  On Wednesday morning  May 11th the corps left barracks and marched all day over the old Staunton road   always in bad condition  especially in the rainy season  to the town of Midway  about 18 miles north of Lexington  and went into camp  sleeping in the rain that night  On May 12th  the corps marched  in a drenching rain  through mud and water  to Staunton    about 18 miles  On May 13th  the corps  having joined Breckinridge s veterans in Staunton  marched some 18 or 20 miles down the Valley Pike to a point south of Harrisonburg  On May 14th  the corps continued down the pike  through Harrisonburg  to within about 7 miles of New Market  a march of about 15 miles  and went into camp in a body of woods on the east side of the pike  On the 14th  there was some skirmishing and an artillery duel between Sigel s advance column and Imboden north of New Market  On Sunday  May l5th  about 1 a  m  a pitch dark and rainy night  the cadets were quietly aroused  and after a prayer by Capt  Frank Preston  B Co  the corps commenced its march to the battle field  but it did not reach the vicinity of New Market until some time after sun rise  because of one or more protracted stops    The Cadets in Action  The corps  after marching and waiting on the pike for probably 10 hours   the battle proper having commenced about 11 a m  was marched by column by the left flank from the pike to a point south of  Shirley s Hill  about one mile south of New Market  and was there  for the first time  formed into line of battle behind a fence at right angles to the pike   See map  south west corner  The corps then advanced north  in line of battle in the third and last echelon  over the crest of Shirley s Hill  As the United States batteries did not get the range of the corps  until it reached the north slope of Shirley s Hill on its descent to the  River Road  there were no casualties up to that point  But on the descent   probably somewhere near the present barn  Capt  Hill  of C Co  and Corporal J  S  Wise  of D Co  and several others were wounded by the explosion of one or more United States shells  This was the corps baptism of blood  In the ravine north of Shirley s Hill  near  River Road  the cadets were halted and made to discard their blankets  etc  And here they saw  for the first time  a sight which amazed them more than the carnage of battle  The officers of the veteran command  composing the second echelon  almost in front of the corps  when their regiment was ordered to advance  had to force the skulkers into ranks at the points of their pistols  The delay in the ravine  while seemingly quite long  is said to have been only a half hour  This was the lull before the storm  for the second or hottest part of the battle commenced between 1 and 2 p  m  It was probably during this interval  or a little earlier  that Imboden crossed over to the east side of Smith s Creek  with the intention of re crossing it to the pike side  in order to turn Sigel s left flank  but the high water in the creek prevented him from consummating this movement  After ascending the south end of the  Bushong  plateau   which extends about one mile north to the Bushong House  a march in line of battle of one quarter to one half mile over this open and comparatively level ground  brought the corps within easy range of the three United States six gun batteries on the top of the  Bushong Hill  A glance at the map will show that Sigel s last position was the very strongest he could have taken  as it filled the narrow neck between the Shenandoah River and Smith s Creek  both of which were practically unfordable from the recent rains  This line  of almost one mile in length  with 18 guns on its right flank and four on its left  had to be charged and driven from its position  in order to win the battle  When the corps reached the point several hundred yards south of the Bushong House  it was subjected to  a terrible fire of artillery  Here  CABELL  first Sergeant D Co  and JONES and CROCKETT privates D Co   fell dead from the explosion of one shell  Here also  but possibly a little farther back  the corps came within range of the United States musketry fire  Almost immediately after the explosion of the shell in D Co  McDOWELL  private B Co   fell  pierced through the heart with a bullet  The corps marched steadily and continuously over this open plateau up to the south front of the Bushong House through  mud  in many places over the ankles  a portion of the time being under both artillery and musketry fire  the alignment of the battalion was like that on parade  the gaps in the ranks  caused by the killed and wounded men  were filled automatically  as if nothing unusual had happened  and at no time did the corps  battle line even waver  When the corps reached the Bushong House  which was near the center of its line of march  it divided in half  A and B Companies passing it on the east side  and C and D Companies on the west  This necessarily broke the previous alignment  which was never fully restored  This movement brought the whole corps into the Bushong orchard  say from 50 to 100 yards in width  where it came within from 200 to 300 yards of the three United States batteries on the top of the Bushong Hill  which  poured incessant volleys of canister and grape into us  to this incessant fire of artillery  must be added the musketry fire of the 34th Mass  Infantry  immediately in front of the corps   In this fatal orchard  STANARD and JEFFERSON  privates B Co  fell mortally wounded   and  in fact  almost all our loss was here  including Col  Scott Shipp  in command of the corps  who was wounded  Capt  Henry A  Wise  of A Co  then took command  and retained it until the end of the battle  The deadly fire of shells  grape  canister and bullets  to which the corps was subjected in the Bushong Orchard  did not cause it to retreat  or even to fall back temporarily  but the cadets  ran forward  to the remains of a demolished rail fence on the north edge of the orchard   laid down behind the fence  and began  for the first time  to fire upon the enemy  the corps  by its rapid advance  having just gotten into the first line of battle and filled a gap  caused by the change of position of one or more other commands  Unfortunately  this position of the corps is not given by Prof  Turner on the Colonna Morgan Map  though it is  by far  the most important one held by the corps during the entire battle  since it filled a wide gap at a critical moment  Beyond question  this was the crisis of the battle  The 51st Virginia Regiment on the left flank of the corps gave way  and had to be rallied  And about this time  say 3 p  m  possibly a quarter of an hour earlier  the 62nd Va  Reg  on the right flank of the corps  while advancing in the rocky field just northeast of the Bushong House  had to fall back to prevent annihilation  Position 19 was evidently the most fatal spot on the battle field  for Capt  Woodson s Missouri Co   attached temporarily to the 62nd Va  lost 60 out of 70 men  or 85 percent  in killed and wounded  The stop of the corps at the orchard fence could not have been over 15 or 20 minutes  But whether long or short  it was the period of the greatest anxiety  during the day  to both officers and men  because it seemed that the next move  on either side would probably determine the result of the battle  and this proved to be correct  For Col  Edgar  an old V  M  I  graduate  commanding the 26th Va  Battalion  had succeeded in turning the United States right flank on the top of Bushong s Hill  The success of this movement stopped the artillery fire and lessened the musketry fire against the corps  and probably against the 51st and 62nd Va  and speedily caused the United States line in front and to the left of the corps to break and retreat  When the heavy artillery fire ceased  the command was given to the corps to charge  This

began  for the first time  to fire upon the enemy  the corps  by its rapid advance  having just gotten into the first line of battle and filled a gap  caused by the change of position of one or more other commands  Unfortunately  this position of the corps is not given by Prof  Turner on the Colonna Morgan Map  though it is  by far  the most important one held by the corps during the entire battle  since it filled a wide gap at a critical moment  Beyond question  this was the crisis of the battle  The 51st Virginia Regiment on the left flank of the corps gave way  and had to be rallied  And about this time  say 3 p  m  possibly a quarter of an hour earlier  the 62nd Va  Reg  on the right flank of the corps  while advancing in the rocky field just northeast of the Bushong House  had to fall back to prevent annihilation  Position 19 was evidently the most fatal spot on the battle field  for Capt  Woodson s Missouri Co   attached temporarily to the 62nd Va  lost 60 out of 70 men  or 85 percent  in killed and wounded  The stop of the corps at the orchard fence could not have been over 15 or 20 minutes  But whether long or short  it was the period of the greatest anxiety  during the day  to both officers and men  because it seemed that the next move  on either side would probably determine the result of the battle  and this proved to be correct  For Col  Edgar  an old V  M  I  graduate  commanding the 26th Va  Battalion  had succeeded in turning the United States right flank on the top of Bushong s Hill  The success of this movement stopped the artillery fire and lessened the musketry fire against the corps  and probably against the 51st and 62nd Va  and speedily caused the United States line in front and to the left of the corps to break and retreat  When the heavy artillery fire ceased  the command was given to the corps to charge  This order was obeyed  not only with alacrity  but with enthusiasm   and though the company organizations were gone  yet they rallied round the colors and formed some sort of a line as we advanced  So eager were the cadets to charge the enemy  100 or 150 yards off  that it was difficult for them to find time to load and shoot their old fashioned muzzle loading muskets This  the final charge  commenced in the wheat field  then a field of mud  just north of the Bushong Orchard  and continued for some distance north towards the Pike bridge over the Shenandoah  The pursuit of the retreating army by the cadets continued until the corps  was halted by order of General Breckinridge  The company organizations and the parade alignment of the corps were never completely restored after the pursuit commenced  The battle proper ended about 4 p  m  though there was some cannonading later in the day on Rude s Hill  about three miles north of the town  It is a question of some doubt  whether any of the nine cadets  who were killed or mortally wounded  fell in this final charge  though a few of the cadets are said to have been wounded after the corps left the Bushong fence  The writer regrets that he cannot locate  with any degree of accuracy  the points where Corporal ATWILL  A Co  Private HAYNES  B Co  and private WHEELWRIGHT  C Co  fell  but he presumes that all three were killed or mortally wounded in  the fatal orchard The Cadets in Action  The corps then advanced north  in line of battle in the third and last echelon  over the crest of Shirley s Hill  As the United States batteries did not get the range of the corps  until it reached the north slope of Shirley s Hill on its descent to the  River Road  there were no casualties up to that point  But on the descent   probably somewhere near the present barn  Capt  Hill  of C Co  and Corporal J  S  Wise  of D Co  and several others were wounded by the explosion of one or more United States shells  This was the corps baptism of blood In the ravine north of Shirley s Hill  near  River Road  the cadets were halted and made to discard their blankets  etc  And here they saw  for the first time  a sight which amazed them more than the carnage of battle  The officers of the veteran command  composing the second echelon  almost in front of the corps  when their regiment was ordered to advance  had to force the skulkers into ranks at the points of their pistols  The delay in the ravine  while seemingly quite long  is said to have been only a half hour  This was the lull before the storm  for the second or hottest part of the battle commenced between 1 and 2 p  m  It was probably during this interval  or a little earlier  that Imboden crossed over to the east side of Smith s Creek  with the intention of re crossing it to the pike side  in order to turn Sigel s left flank  but the high water in the creek prevented him from consummating this movement After ascending the south end of the  Bushong  plateau   which extends about one mile north to the Bushong House  a march in line of battle of one quarter to one half mile over this open and comparatively level ground  brought the corps within easy range of the three United States six gun batteries on the top of the  Bushong Hill  A glance at the map will show that Sigel s last position was the very strongest he could have taken  as it filled the narrow neck between the Shenandoah River and Smith s Creek  both of which were practically unfordable from the recent rains  This line  of almost one mile in length  with 18 guns on its right flank and four on its left  had to be charged and driven from its position  in order to win the battle When the corps reached the point several hundred yards south of the Bushong House  it was subjected to  a terrible fire of artillery  Here  CABELL  first Sergeant D Co  and JONES and CROCKETT privates D Co   fell dead from the explosion of one shell  Here also  but possibly a little farther back  the corps came within range of the United States musketry fire  Almost immediately after the explosion of the shell in D Co  McDOWELL  private B Co   fell  pierced through the heart with a bullet The corps marched steadily and continuously over this open plateau up to the south front of the Bushong House through  mud  in many places over the ankles  a portion of the time being under both artillery and musketry fire  the alignment of the battalion was like that on parade  the gaps in the ranks  caused by the killed and wounded men  were filled automatically  as if nothing unusual had happened  and at no time did the corps  battle line even waver When the corps reached the Bushong House  which was near the center of its line of march  it divided in half  A and B Companies passing it on the east side  and C and D Companies on the west  This necessarily broke the previous alignment  which was never fully restored  This movement brought the whole corps into the Bushong orchard  say from 50 to 100 yards in width  where it came within from 200 to 300 yards of the three United States batteries on the top of the Bushong Hill  which  poured incessant volleys of canister and grape into us  to this incessant fire of artillery  must be added the musketry fire of the 34th Mass  Infantry  immediately in front of the corps   In this fatal orchard  STANARD and JEFFERSON  privates B Co  fell mortally wounded   and  in fact  almost all our loss was here  including Col  Scott Shipp  in command of the corps  who was wounded  Capt  Henry A  Wise  of A Co  then took command  and retained it until the end of the battle The deadly fire of shells  grape  canister and bullets  to which the corps was subjected in the Bushong Orchard  did not cause it to retreat  or even to fall back temporarily  but the cadets  ran forward  to the remains of a demolished rail fence on the north edge of the orchard   laid down
