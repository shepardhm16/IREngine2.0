Timeline A Brief History of the VMI Barracks Timeline and Online Exhibit View Barracks History Online Exhibit The Virginia Military Institute  founded on the site of a Virginia State Arsenal  opened its doors to cadets on November 11  1839  For more than a decade  students were housed in the old arsenal barracks  wholly inadequate to meet the needs of a modern college with a growing student body  Francis H  Smith  VMI s energetic young Superintendent  worked with the noted American architect Alexander Jackson Davis to design new buildings for the school  among them a new barracks  His Gothic revival style has since influenced every other building on the VMI Post  The Barracks was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1966  and the VMI Post was named a National Historic District in 1974  Timeline 1839 The first cadets occupied the dilapidated arsenal building  which had been constructed in 1816 and had fallen into disrepair  Smith later said that  the whole establishment presented the appearance of a prison More about the arsenal  1848 1851 Superintendent Francis H  Smith  with the enthusiastic support of VMI Board of Visitors member Philip St  George Cocke  embarked upon efforts to secure funding for building projects  including a new Barracks  Cocke s elegant home  Belmead  in Powhatan County  had been designed by the prominent New York architect Alexander Jackson Davis  1851 The legislature appropriated  30 000 in support of the the barracks  Smith worked with Davis to finalize plans for a massive brick and stucco structure  a quadrangle which was to measure 225 by 326 feet  The cornerstone was laid on July 4  1851  1851 September The front  or south  facade of Barracks  today s Washington Arch facade  was completed and cadets occupied the quarters on September 24  The building also included classrooms  one of which was occupied by the newly hired professor of Natural Philosophy  Major Thomas J  Jackson  The old arsenal building was dismantled  1851 1859 Barracks expansion using Davis s design continued  with work on the east and west wings  By 1859 the Parade Ground  west  facade had reached the large tower where Jackson Arch stands today  Davis had provided Smith with a flexible design  allowing for enlargement in  17 foot sections at pleasure  as funds became available  The barracks took the shape of a  J  1860 May

buildings burned by General David Hunter  1866 1869 Barracks was rebuilt and the east wing finished  The building remained essentially unchanged for the next 25 years  1893 1896 The VMI Board of Visitors decided to honor Stonewall Jackson with a memorial hall  The Board endorsed the plan of alumnus Isaac E  A  Rose  who created an elaborate Gothic extension to Davis s parade facade of Barracks  This incongruous addition was torn down in 1915  only the Jackson Arch portion was retained  The barracks is now in the shape of a  U  1900 A classroom building named in honor of Francis H  Smith was constructed at the north end of the quadrangle  The building was designed by William G  McDowell of Lexington  1914 Architect Bertram Goodhue was commissioned by the Board of Visitors to evaluate the design of the VMI Post and to address the issue of long range planning  He recommended the demolition of the non Davis portions of the Barracks  Isaac Rose s Jackson Memorial Hall and McDowell s Smith Building providing for a return to Davis s original plan of a complete quadrangle with a symmetrical facade facing the Parade Ground  1915 1916 Old Jackson Memorial Hall  the addition

rooms on both sides of Jackson Arch  1923 The Smith Academic Building was torn down  replaced by the north wing of Barracks  The quadrangle  originally conceived by A  J  Davis in 1851  was now
