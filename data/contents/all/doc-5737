24450 SURI Awards Announced Institute Report  March 2012 Thirty three proposals were funded through the 2012 Summer Undergraduate Research Institute for projects to be carried out this summer  including two answering the call for service oriented projects  Michelle McCusker  14 will work with Col  Christina McDonald  director of the Institute Writing Program  on her project   Rhetoric  Community  Advocacy  Making the Case for a System of Sustainable Health Care in Rockbridge County  And John McDonald  15 will work with Lt  Col  Chuck Newhouse  assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering and Maj  Jenny deHart  sustainability coordinator  on  Materials Testing of Recycled Plastics in Concrete   I m really excited about it  said Lt  Col  Keith Kline  director of the Center for Undergraduate Research   She  deHart  came here with this great vision for this sort of living laboratory where cadets could do research   It s not like there have never been service oriented projects before  added Kline   but this was something that we tried to emphasize this time around because we believe that it s consistent with the citizen soldier aspect of VMI s mission  We re trying to encourage undergraduate research projects that positively impact society  Another new initiative of the Center this spring was an undergraduate research  speed exploration  event  which prompted Molly Hastings  13 to submit a proposal  something she had not been planning to do   The result was a highly rated SURI proposal  said Kline  Hastings will work with Maj  Scott Frein  assistant professor of psychology  on her project   Examining the Effects of a Single Meditation Training Session on Cognitive Processes and Psychological Well Being  Other cadet mentor pairings are
