departments are focusing on the molecular side of the discipline  the study of field biology   animals  plants  and ecosystems   is going strong at VMI   These courses  are critical for understanding biology that does not happen on a bench top in a lab  said Lt  Col  Paul Moosman  98  associate professor of biology   Most biology is happening outside and you ve got to get out there and see it firsthand if you are really going to appreciate it and become a biologist  Moosman is providing this hands on experience this semester for cadets in his mammalogy class through a series of field trips and on post activities  In a recent visit to Sky Farm in Rockbridge County  cadets trapped small mammals  made observations about them  and recorded their findings to determine the species of the animal  There was even a surprising discovery   We ended up catching a species called the hispid cotton rat  which is not supposed to be in Rockbridge County  said Moosman  explaining that this species had not previously been documented this far north   It demonstrates that you have to question some of the information you read in a book    This is why we do small mammal surveys  so we can learn about these phenomena and changes in nature  Moosman also planned to take cadets to another site in Rockbridge County  Devil s Marbleyard in Arnolds Valley  where a rare species of bat is known to roost   We re going to go out and track this bat down  and they ll learn about its biology firsthand out there  I ll show them how to handle bats and how to take information from them  Moosman explained   We want to get  cadets  out and show them what it s like to actually do science    This is how fun it is  it s why so many people like to be scientists  Another important component of mammalogy field work  radio tracking animals for ongoing data collection  was simulated on post toward the end of the class  The students actually tracked one another to practice using the radio telemetry gear used to track animals  The cadets also visited the Virginia Museum of Natural History in Martinsville to see the behind the scenes scientific mission of the museum  These experiences prepare cadets for careers in field biology  such as with government agencies at the state and federal level  and in environmental consulting for industry and teaching   What is going to dictate whether we do well as a nation is related to the health of our ecosystems  said Moosman   All of our natural resources come from it  all of our agricultural systems are dependent on it  so if that stops working  we re in trouble     But  there are really not a lot of people trained in natural resources  In contrast to larger schools  VMI s biology department has no shortage of faculty members whose area of expertise falls under the scope of field biology  In addition to Moosman s mammalogy course  classes offered include ornithology   the study of birds   and herpetology   the study of reptiles   in addition to aquatic ecosystems  conservation biology  parasitology  and invertebrate biology  When Col  Dick Rowe came to VMI in 1991  he noticed a definite trend in the biology curriculum   The biology department was very heavily field oriented  in the 70s and 80s     then  the field biology component went away and we became the  pre med department  Rowe said   Cadets who wanted to go to medical school   we were serving them well  But Rowe saw a need to re emphasize the field biology curriculum  While department head from 1997 to 2009  Rowe hired several professors to meet this need  and current department head Col  James Turner  65 has continued the initiative   We looked at a number of students in our major  and we weren t giving them the background they desired  so we tried to build it  explained Rowe   Cadets wanted courses in which they could go out in the field   many of them hunted  they liked the outdoors    We started to slowly build the program  We were able to hire some more faculty  and all of a sudden we had a nucleus of field biologists   and their courses are very popular   We re looking ahead  saying  field biology  is important  something that most of the big universities have gone away from  added Moosman   and it s really the small colleges like VMI that are doing the important work of training biologists to be organismal field
