analysts and portfolio managers  The VMI Foundation founded and funded the Cadet Investment Group  CIG  beginning in 1986  The group s mission is to learn about investing and the stock market  To do this  members serve as officers  managing directors covering the major industry sectors  and as investment analysts  In fall 2013  the group expanded from two teams to three  Team A focuses on large capitalization stocks  more than  10 billion in market value  Team B invests in middle capitalization stocks  from  1 billion to  10 billion in market value  while Team C invests in small capitalization stocks  market value between  500 million and  1 billion  Each team is structured similarly  with a president and vice president  managing directors and investment analysts  The expansion increased the group from 31 members to 43  including an increase in officers from five to seven  CIG is open to all 1st  2nd and 3rd class cadets  without regard to major  The groups are managed by a Chairman  who is responsible for all administrative activities  One member served in the capacity of Vice Chair of Education  Faculty advisors to the CIG are Col  Cliff West and Col  Bob Moreschi  The groups use their own specific screening criteria  focusing on financial strength with a  value  approach  Firms on the screening list are then further analyzed  both on fundamental and technical variable  Sector analysis with a  top down  investment style is also incorporated  Members are divided into four person sector teams  tasked with analyzing their sector and making recommendations on the amount of dollars to invest in each sector  These teams also are the primary source for information about stock positions to sell and new stocks to purchase  relative to the respective groups  At the beginning of the year  the combined assets of the three groups were  311 000  By late April 2014  the market value of the combined portfolios was in excess of  315 000  The group took two trips this year to visit investment firms  In October twelve members and the advisors  Col  West and Col  Moreschi  traveled to NYC and spent time meeting with executives of J P  Morgan  TM Capital  Wilkinson O Grady   Col  Inc  and Bloomberg LP  In addition  the group was hosted to dinner with many of the NYC VMI alumni  In March a larger group traveled to Richmond to meet with

across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  At least 16 Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2014  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well as inside our own department  Sometimes alumni are willing to mentor cadets  but this usually requires a personal relationship to happen  All of these efforts  in combination or singly  occur each year  Some of the companies who will have cadet interns this summer include  Northwestern Mutual  Virginia Beach Target Stores  Stuarts Draft  Virginia Recommended Media  Hollywood  California Hireprobability com  Boston  Massachusetts Bloomberg LP in Princeton  New Jersey Barney and Barney  San Diego  California Florida Investors Center of America  in Tampa  Florida Virginia Amateur Sports  Inc  in Roanoke  Virginia Bank of America  New York Sports marketing Company in Rockaway  New Jersey Smith Mountain Lake State Park  Virginia  Assistant Manager  Merger Market  New York Steve Goddard Investment Company  Goochland  Virginia Captiva Spine  Inc  Jupiter  Florida Mid Atlantic Commercial Real Estate  Newport News  Virginia Minnesota Appraisal Services  Minneapolis  Minnesota At least 6 of these 16 cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  some will be paid  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for those cadets who are often earning salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer  or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Bruce Macdonald  Internship Coordinator for the Department of Economics and Business  at macdonaldbn10 vmi edu  or  540  464 7451  Honor Societies Sigma Beta Delta  the
