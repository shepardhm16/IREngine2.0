Fixed Assets Module is in place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy  A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year  Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment  80110  Land Buildings  Equipment and Intangible Assets Return to top  Capital assets include land  buildings and other improvements  library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year the expense is incurred  Interest expense relating to construction is capitalized net of interest income earned on resources set aside for this purpose  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to an asset s value or materially extend its useful life are not capitalized  The Institute capitalizes moveable equipment at a value or initial cost of  5 000 or more and an estimated useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions    Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below  Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library materials  Intangible assets  50 years  10 30 years  5 25 years  10 years  5 years to indefinite  Generally the acquisition of land  land improvements  buildings and building improvement assets require the special approvals  authorizations  and appropriations of the Commonwealth of Virginia s capital outlay projects policies and procedures These special procedures are necessary for all such acquisitions in excess of  1 000 000 or as amended by the Commonwealth  in compliance with the 2008 Acts of Assembly  Chapter 879  Section 4 4 01m 6 a  The Comptroller s office will review all of these project expenditures and uses the general contractor s  schedule of values  to determine how to capitalize these projects  Construction project costs are accumulated and reported in the  Construction In Progress  asset category until the project is substantially complete and the related asset is actually put into service  The costs in the construction in progress account are reclassified into the various fixed asset categories as appropriate  buildings which includes building improvements  land improvements and equipment  Buildings  land improvements and equipment are recorded in the Colleague Finance General Ledger  Land and construction in progress are not recorded in Colleague Finance  however  journal entries are prepared to update the general ledger with summary totals  80120  Institute Owned Works of Art  Historical Treasurers and Similar Assets Return to top  The Institute does not capitalize works of art  historical treasurers and similar assets  Such items are held for public exhibition  education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than financial gain  Institute collections may be sold but the proceeds must be used for the acquisition of similar type Institute collections  Exceptions to this requirement must be pre approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support  80200  Asset Acquisition Return to top  Equipment items that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Fixed Asset System can be acquired in the following ways  New Purchases Donations Transfer from other State Agencies Departments are responsible for making sure the equipment information is reported to the property management personnel in the Comptroller s Office  using an equipment record form All recordable assets should be reported to the Comptroller s Office upon receipt and acceptance  For equipment purchases  title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received  Similarly  for donated assets  title is considered to pass when the asset is available for use by the Institute and when the Institute assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset  80210  New Purchases Return to top  New purchases must be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if the asset meets the capitalization criteria or if the Institute determines it is a controllable asset  an asset that does not meet the capitalization criteria but because of its nature is more susceptible to theft or abuse  Equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds  Category I  must be recorded  regardless of the purchase amount as these assets serve as collateral for the bonds sold to acquire them  however  Category I assets must cost  500 or more and have a useful life of 3 years or more Equipment acquired with state or local funds other than Equipment Trust Funds  Category II  will be recorded if the purchase price is  2 000 or above  All computers will be recorded and tagged regardless of purchase cost  It is the responsibility of departments as well as the property management personnel to ensure that all asset acquisitions are recorded at the proper amount Documentation must be maintained in support of each asset amount assigned  80220  Acquisition Cost Return to top  Acquisition cost includes the purchase price  as well as cost incurred to place an asset in its intended location and in an operable condition Such costs associated with an asset would include freight and transportation charges  and or installation costs  Add any appropriate cost detailed above to the actual cost of the equipment  Acquisition cost is based on individual unit prices Assets should not be grouped  For example  three personal computers  PC  acquired for  2 000 each on one requisition would not be considered one capital asset with a value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding the asset  The responsible person may or may not be directly involved in using the asset  but is typically responsible for asset acquisition or disposition within a given area or department  Each department s inventory is available in Entrinsik  80440  Tagging Return to top  Tagging provides a method of assigning a unique identification number to each fixed asset equipment item  in order for the item to be accounted for and identified within the Fixed Asset System Numbers will be assigned in consecutive order without regard to asset type or location  Bar coded tags have been integrated to facilitate the inventory process  Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag  The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer using a Disposition of Equipment Form 80610  Sell or Trade In Return to top  Surplus assets may be sold to another state agency  local governmental entity  or through a public auction The Institute may be able to upgrade existing items by trading in one asset for another  The trade in of the old asset is processed as a disposal and the new asset is entered into the Fixed Asset System at the invoiced price  which should reflect not only the cash paid but the undepreciated value of the asset traded in  80620  Abandonment  Return to top  Fixed assets retaining no salvage or disposal value will occasionally be discarded or abandoned as scrap as determined by the Surplus Property Officer and or the Fixed Assets Officer  80630 Transfers  Return to top  Permanent transfer of fixed assets within the Institute must be identified by the department as transfers are made Any changes need to be reported to Fixed Assets Officer using an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form  These modifications include changes in room number  building  department  responsible person  etc  80640 Casualty Loss  Return to top  Fixed Asset items that are destroyed by fire or other catastrophic circumstances must be removed from the records by submitting the Disposition of Equipment Form to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  80650  Cannibalization Return to top  In some cases  fixed assets which are no longer functional are cannibalized to obtain parts that can be utilized to repair other like assets The original item is considered surplus and disposed of by cannibalization after approval from the Surplus Property Officer or the Fixed Asset Officer  80700 Lost or Stolen Return to top  Fixed asset items which are unaccounted for following verification of the inventory report must be removed from the inventory database Items that are known to be lost or stolen must be reported to Post Police immediately and the appropriate theft report information must be forwarded to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  Fixed Assets Forms Equipment Record Disposition of Equip Form Transfer Replace

in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding the asset  The responsible person may or may not be directly involved in using the asset  but is typically responsible for asset acquisition or disposition within a given area or department  Each department s inventory is available in Entrinsik  80440  Tagging Return to top  Tagging provides a method of assigning a unique identification number to each fixed asset equipment item  in order for the item to be accounted for and identified within the Fixed Asset System Numbers will be assigned in consecutive order without regard to asset type or location  Bar coded tags have been integrated to facilitate the inventory process  Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag  The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer using a Disposition of Equipment Form 80610  Sell or Trade In Return to top  Surplus assets may be sold to another state agency  local governmental entity  or through a public auction The Institute may be able to upgrade existing items by trading in one asset for another  The trade in of the old asset is processed as a disposal and the new asset is entered into the Fixed Asset System at the invoiced price  which should reflect not only the cash paid but the undepreciated value of the asset traded in  80620  Abandonment  Return to top  Fixed assets retaining no salvage or disposal value will occasionally be discarded or abandoned as scrap as determined by the Surplus Property Officer and or the Fixed Assets Officer  80630 Transfers  Return to top  Permanent transfer of fixed assets within the Institute must be identified by the department as transfers are made Any changes need to be reported to Fixed Assets Officer using an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form  These modifications include changes in room number  building  department  responsible person  etc  80640 Casualty Loss  Return to top  Fixed Asset items that are destroyed by fire or other catastrophic circumstances must be removed from the records by submitting the Disposition of Equipment Form to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  80650  Cannibalization Return to top  In some cases  fixed assets which are no longer functional are cannibalized to obtain parts that can be utilized to repair other like assets The original item is considered surplus and disposed of by cannibalization after approval from the Surplus Property Officer or the Fixed Asset Officer  80700 Lost or Stolen Return to top  Fixed asset items which are unaccounted for following verification of the inventory report must be removed from the inventory database Items that are known to be lost or stolen must be reported to Post Police immediately and the appropriate theft report information must be forwarded to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  Fixed

place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy  A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year  Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment  80110  Land Buildings  Equipment and Intangible Assets Return to top  Capital assets include land  buildings and other improvements  library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year the expense is incurred  Interest expense relating to construction is capitalized net of interest income earned on resources set aside for this purpose  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to an asset s value or materially extend its useful life are not capitalized  The Institute capitalizes moveable equipment at a value or initial cost of  5 000 or more and an estimated useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions    Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below  Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library materials  Intangible assets  50 years  10 30 years  5 25 years  10 years  5 years to indefinite  Generally the acquisition of land  land improvements  buildings and building improvement assets require the special approvals  authorizations  and appropriations of the Commonwealth of Virginia s capital outlay projects policies and procedures These special procedures are necessary for all such acquisitions in excess of  1 000 000 or as amended by the Commonwealth  in compliance with the 2008 Acts of Assembly  Chapter 879  Section 4 4 01m 6 a  The Comptroller s office will review all of these project expenditures and uses the general contractor s  schedule of values  to determine how to capitalize these projects  Construction project costs are accumulated and reported in the  Construction In Progress  asset category until the project is substantially complete and the related asset is actually put into service  The costs in the construction in progress account are reclassified into the various fixed asset categories as appropriate  buildings which includes building improvements  land improvements and equipment  Buildings  land improvements and equipment are recorded in the Colleague Finance General Ledger  Land and construction in progress are not recorded in Colleague Finance  however  journal entries are prepared to update the general ledger with summary totals  80120  Institute Owned Works of Art  Historical Treasurers and Similar Assets Return to top  The Institute does not capitalize works of art  historical treasurers and similar assets  Such items are held for public exhibition  education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than financial gain  Institute collections may be sold but the proceeds must be used for the acquisition of similar type Institute collections  Exceptions to this requirement must be pre approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support  80200  Asset Acquisition Return to top  Equipment items that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Fixed Asset System can be acquired in the following ways  New Purchases Donations Transfer from other State Agencies Departments are responsible for making sure the equipment information is reported to the property management personnel in the Comptroller s Office  using an equipment record form All recordable assets should be reported to the Comptroller s Office upon receipt and acceptance  For equipment purchases  title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received  Similarly  for donated assets  title is considered to pass when the asset is available for use by the Institute and when the Institute assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset  80210  New Purchases Return to top  New purchases must be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if the asset meets the capitalization criteria or if the Institute determines it is a controllable asset  an asset that does not meet the capitalization criteria but because of its nature is more susceptible to theft or abuse  Equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds  Category I  must be recorded  regardless of the purchase amount as these assets serve as collateral for the bonds sold to acquire them  however  Category I assets must cost  500 or more and have a useful life of 3 years or more Equipment acquired with state or local funds other than Equipment Trust Funds  Category II  will be recorded if the purchase price is  2 000 or above  All computers will be recorded and tagged regardless of purchase cost  It is the responsibility of departments as well as the property management personnel to ensure that all asset acquisitions are recorded at the proper amount Documentation must be maintained in support of each asset amount assigned  80220  Acquisition Cost Return to top  Acquisition cost includes the purchase price  as well as cost incurred to place an asset in its intended location and in an operable condition Such costs associated with an asset would include freight and transportation charges  and or installation costs  Add any appropriate cost detailed above to the actual cost of the equipment  Acquisition cost is based on individual unit prices Assets should not be grouped  For example  three personal computers  PC  acquired for  2 000 each on one requisition would not be considered one capital asset with a value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for

other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property

Datatel Colleague Fixed Assets Module is in place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy  A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year  Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment  80110  Land Buildings  Equipment and Intangible Assets Return to top  Capital assets include land  buildings and other improvements  library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year the expense is incurred  Interest expense relating to construction is capitalized net of interest income earned on resources set aside for this purpose  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to an asset s value or materially extend its useful life are not capitalized  The Institute capitalizes moveable equipment at a value or initial cost of  5 000 or more and an estimated useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions    Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below  Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library materials  Intangible assets  50 years  10 30 years  5 25 years  10 years  5 years to indefinite  Generally the acquisition of land  land improvements  buildings and building improvement assets require the special approvals  authorizations  and appropriations of the Commonwealth of Virginia s capital outlay projects policies and procedures These special procedures are necessary for all such acquisitions in excess of  1 000 000 or as amended by the Commonwealth  in compliance with the 2008 Acts of Assembly  Chapter 879  Section 4 4 01m 6 a  The Comptroller s office will review all of these project expenditures and uses the general contractor s  schedule of values  to determine how to capitalize these projects  Construction project costs are accumulated and reported in the  Construction In Progress  asset category until the project is substantially complete and the related asset is actually put into service  The costs in the construction in progress account are reclassified into the various fixed asset categories as appropriate  buildings which includes building improvements  land improvements and equipment  Buildings  land improvements and equipment are recorded in the Colleague Finance General Ledger  Land and construction in progress are not recorded in Colleague Finance  however  journal entries are prepared to update the general ledger with summary totals  80120  Institute Owned Works of Art  Historical Treasurers and Similar Assets Return to top  The Institute does not capitalize works of art  historical treasurers and similar assets  Such items are held for public exhibition  education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than financial gain  Institute collections may be sold but the proceeds must be used for the acquisition of similar type Institute collections  Exceptions to this requirement must be pre approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support  80200  Asset Acquisition Return to top  Equipment items that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Fixed Asset System can be acquired in the following ways  New Purchases Donations Transfer from other State Agencies Departments are responsible for making sure the equipment information is reported to the property management personnel in the Comptroller s Office  using an equipment record form All recordable assets should be reported to the Comptroller s Office upon receipt and acceptance  For equipment purchases  title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received  Similarly  for donated assets  title is considered to pass when the asset is available for use by the Institute and when the Institute assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset  80210  New Purchases Return to top  New purchases must be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if the asset meets the capitalization criteria or if the Institute determines it is a controllable asset  an asset that does not meet the capitalization criteria but because of its nature is more susceptible to theft or abuse  Equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds  Category I  must be recorded  regardless of the purchase amount as these assets serve as collateral for the bonds sold to acquire them  however  Category I assets must cost  500 or more and have a useful life of 3 years or more Equipment acquired with state or local funds other than Equipment Trust Funds  Category II  will be recorded if the purchase price is  2 000 or above  All computers will be recorded and tagged regardless of purchase cost  It is the responsibility of departments as well as the property management personnel to ensure that all asset acquisitions are recorded at the proper amount Documentation must be maintained in support of each asset amount assigned  80220  Acquisition Cost Return to top  Acquisition cost includes the purchase price  as well as cost incurred to place an asset in its intended location and in an operable condition Such costs associated with an asset would include freight and transportation charges  and or installation costs  Add any appropriate cost detailed above to the actual cost of the equipment  Acquisition cost is based on individual unit prices Assets should not be grouped  For example  three personal computers  PC  acquired for  2 000 each on one requisition would not be considered one capital asset with a value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding the asset  The responsible person may or may not be directly involved in using the asset  but is typically responsible for asset acquisition or disposition within a given area or department  Each department s inventory is available in Entrinsik  80440  Tagging Return to top  Tagging provides a method of assigning a unique identification number to each fixed asset equipment item  in order for the item to be accounted for and identified within the Fixed Asset System Numbers will be assigned in consecutive order without regard to asset type or location  Bar coded tags have been integrated to facilitate the inventory process  Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag  The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer using a Disposition of Equipment Form 80610  Sell or Trade In Return to top  Surplus assets may be sold to another state agency  local governmental entity  or through a public auction The Institute may be able to upgrade existing items by trading in one asset for another  The trade in of the old asset is processed as a disposal and the new asset is entered into the Fixed Asset System at the invoiced price  which should reflect not only the cash paid but the undepreciated value of the asset traded in  80620  Abandonment  Return to top  Fixed assets retaining no salvage or disposal value will occasionally be discarded or abandoned as scrap as determined by the Surplus Property Officer and or the Fixed Assets Officer  80630 Transfers  Return to top  Permanent transfer of fixed assets within the Institute must be identified by the department as transfers are made Any changes need to be reported to Fixed Assets Officer using an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form  These modifications include changes in room number  building  department  responsible person  etc  80640 Casualty Loss  Return to top  Fixed Asset items that are destroyed by fire or other catastrophic circumstances must be removed from the records by submitting the Disposition of Equipment Form to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  80650  Cannibalization Return to top  In some cases  fixed assets which are no longer functional are cannibalized to obtain parts that can be utilized to repair other like assets The original item is considered surplus and disposed of by cannibalization after approval from the Surplus Property Officer or the Fixed Asset Officer  80700 Lost or Stolen Return to top  Fixed asset items which are unaccounted for following verification of the inventory report must be removed from the inventory database Items that are known to be lost or stolen must be reported to Post Police immediately and the

considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding the asset  The responsible person may or may not be directly involved in using the asset  but is typically responsible for asset acquisition or disposition within a given area or department  Each department s inventory is available in Entrinsik  80440  Tagging Return to top  Tagging provides a method of assigning a unique identification number to each fixed asset equipment item  in order for the item to be accounted for and identified within the Fixed Asset System Numbers will be assigned in consecutive order without regard to asset type or location  Bar coded tags have been integrated to facilitate the inventory process  Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag  The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer using a Disposition of Equipment Form 80610  Sell or Trade In Return to top  Surplus assets may be sold to another state agency  local governmental entity  or through a public auction The Institute may be able to upgrade existing items by trading in one asset for another  The trade in of the old asset is processed as a disposal and the new asset is entered into the Fixed Asset System at the invoiced price  which should reflect not only the cash paid but the undepreciated value of the asset traded in  80620  Abandonment  Return to top  Fixed assets retaining no salvage or disposal value will occasionally be discarded or abandoned as scrap as determined by the Surplus Property Officer and or the Fixed Assets Officer  80630 Transfers  Return to top  Permanent transfer of fixed assets within the Institute must be identified by the department as transfers are made Any changes need to be reported to Fixed Assets Officer using an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form  These modifications include changes in room number  building  department  responsible person  etc  80640 Casualty Loss  Return to top  Fixed Asset items that are destroyed by fire or other catastrophic circumstances must be removed from the records by submitting the Disposition of Equipment Form to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  80650  Cannibalization Return to top  In some cases  fixed assets which are no longer functional are cannibalized to obtain parts that can be utilized to repair other like assets The original item is considered surplus and disposed of by cannibalization after approval from the Surplus Property Officer or the Fixed Asset Officer  80700 Lost or Stolen Return to top  Fixed asset items which are unaccounted for following verification of the inventory report must be removed from the inventory database Items that are known to be lost or stolen must be reported to Post Police immediately and the appropriate theft report information must be forwarded to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  Fixed Assets Forms Equipment Record Disposition of Equip Form Transfer Replace

Fixed Assets Module is in place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy  A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year  Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment  80110  Land Buildings  Equipment and Intangible Assets Return to top  Capital assets include land  buildings and other improvements  library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year the expense is incurred  Interest expense relating to construction is capitalized net of interest income earned on resources set aside for this purpose  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to an asset s value or materially extend its useful life are not capitalized  The Institute capitalizes moveable equipment at a value or initial cost of  5 000 or more and an estimated useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions    Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below  Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library materials  Intangible assets  50 years  10 30 years  5 25 years  10 years  5 years to indefinite  Generally the acquisition of land  land improvements  buildings and building improvement assets require the special approvals  authorizations  and appropriations of the Commonwealth of Virginia s capital outlay projects policies and procedures These special procedures are necessary for all such acquisitions in excess of  1 000 000 or as amended by the Commonwealth  in compliance with the 2008 Acts of Assembly  Chapter 879  Section 4 4 01m 6 a  The Comptroller s office will review all of these project expenditures and uses the general contractor s  schedule of values  to determine how to capitalize these projects  Construction project costs are accumulated and reported in the  Construction In Progress  asset category until the project is substantially complete and the related asset is actually put into service  The costs in the construction in progress account are reclassified into the various fixed asset categories as appropriate  buildings which includes building improvements  land improvements and equipment  Buildings  land improvements and equipment are recorded in the Colleague Finance General Ledger  Land and construction in progress are not recorded in Colleague Finance  however  journal entries are prepared to update the general ledger with summary totals  80120  Institute Owned Works of Art  Historical Treasurers and Similar Assets Return to top  The Institute does not capitalize works of art  historical treasurers and similar assets  Such items are held for public exhibition  education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than financial gain  Institute collections may be sold but the proceeds must be used for the acquisition of similar type Institute collections  Exceptions to this requirement must be pre approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support  80200  Asset Acquisition Return to top  Equipment items that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Fixed Asset System can be acquired in the following ways  New Purchases Donations Transfer from other State Agencies Departments are responsible for making sure the equipment information is reported to the property management personnel in the Comptroller s Office  using an equipment record form All recordable assets should be reported to the Comptroller s Office upon receipt and acceptance  For equipment purchases  title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received  Similarly  for donated assets  title is considered to pass when the asset is available for use by the Institute and when the Institute assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset  80210  New Purchases Return to top  New purchases must be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if the asset meets the capitalization criteria or if the Institute determines it is a controllable asset  an asset that does not meet the capitalization criteria but because of its nature is more susceptible to theft or abuse  Equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds  Category I  must be recorded  regardless of the purchase amount as these assets serve as collateral for the bonds sold to acquire them  however  Category I assets must cost  500 or more and have a useful life of 3 years or more Equipment acquired with state or local funds other than Equipment Trust Funds  Category II  will be recorded if the purchase price is  2 000 or above  All computers will be recorded and tagged regardless of purchase cost  It is the responsibility of departments as well as the property management personnel to ensure that all asset acquisitions are recorded at the proper amount Documentation must be maintained in support of each asset amount assigned  80220  Acquisition Cost Return to top  Acquisition cost includes the purchase price  as well as cost incurred to place an asset in its intended location and in an operable condition Such costs associated with an asset would include freight and transportation charges  and or installation costs  Add any appropriate cost detailed above to the actual cost of the equipment  Acquisition cost is based on individual unit prices Assets should not be grouped  For example  three personal computers  PC  acquired for  2 000 each on one requisition would not be considered one capital asset with a value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding the asset  The responsible person may or may not be directly involved in using the asset  but is typically responsible for asset acquisition or disposition within a given area or department  Each department s inventory is available in Entrinsik  80440  Tagging Return to top  Tagging provides a method of assigning a unique identification number to each fixed asset equipment item  in order for the item to be accounted for and identified within the Fixed Asset System Numbers will be assigned in consecutive order without regard to asset type or location  Bar coded tags have been integrated to facilitate the inventory process  Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag  The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer using a Disposition of Equipment Form 80610  Sell or Trade In Return to top  Surplus assets may be sold to another state agency  local governmental entity  or through a public auction The Institute may be able to upgrade existing items by trading in one asset for another  The trade in of the old asset is processed as a disposal and the new asset is entered into the Fixed Asset System at the invoiced price  which should reflect not only the cash paid but the undepreciated value of the asset traded in  80620  Abandonment  Return to top  Fixed assets retaining no salvage or disposal value will occasionally be discarded or abandoned as scrap as determined by the Surplus Property Officer and or the Fixed Assets Officer  80630 Transfers  Return to top  Permanent transfer of fixed assets within the Institute must be identified by the department as transfers are made Any changes need to be reported to Fixed Assets Officer using an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form  These modifications include changes in room number  building  department  responsible person  etc  80640 Casualty Loss  Return to top  Fixed Asset items that are destroyed by fire or other catastrophic circumstances must be removed from the records by submitting the Disposition of Equipment Form to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  80650  Cannibalization Return to top  In some cases  fixed assets which are no longer functional are cannibalized to obtain parts that can be utilized to repair other like assets The original item is considered surplus and disposed of by cannibalization after approval from the Surplus Property Officer or the Fixed Asset Officer  80700 Lost or Stolen Return to top  Fixed asset items which are unaccounted for following verification of the inventory report must be removed from the inventory database Items that are known to be lost or stolen must be reported to Post Police immediately and the appropriate theft report information must be forwarded to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  Fixed Assets Forms Equipment Record Disposition of Equip Form Transfer Replace

80100  Overview of the Datatel Colleague Fixed Asset Module Return to top  The Datatel Colleague Fixed Assets Module is in place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy  A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year  Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment  80110  Land Buildings  Equipment and Intangible Assets Return to top  Capital assets include land  buildings and other improvements  library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year the expense is incurred  Interest expense relating to construction is capitalized net of interest income earned on resources set aside for this purpose  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to an asset s value or materially extend its useful life are not capitalized  The Institute capitalizes moveable equipment at a value or initial cost of  5 000 or more and an estimated useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions    Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below  Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library materials  Intangible assets  50 years  10 30 years  5 25 years  10 years  5 years to indefinite  Generally the acquisition of land  land improvements  buildings and building improvement assets require the special approvals  authorizations  and appropriations of the Commonwealth of Virginia s capital outlay projects policies and procedures These special procedures are necessary for all such acquisitions in excess of  1 000 000 or as amended by the Commonwealth  in compliance with the 2008 Acts of Assembly  Chapter 879  Section 4 4 01m 6 a  The Comptroller s office will review all of these project expenditures and uses the general contractor s  schedule of values  to determine how to capitalize these projects  Construction project costs are accumulated and reported in the  Construction In Progress  asset category until the project is substantially complete and the related asset is actually put into service  The costs in the construction in progress account are reclassified into the various fixed asset categories as appropriate  buildings which includes building improvements  land improvements and equipment  Buildings  land improvements and equipment are recorded in the Colleague Finance General Ledger  Land and construction in progress are not recorded in Colleague Finance  however  journal entries are prepared to update the general ledger with summary totals  80120  Institute Owned Works of Art  Historical Treasurers and Similar Assets Return to top  The Institute does not capitalize works of art  historical treasurers and similar assets  Such items are held for public exhibition  education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than financial gain  Institute collections may be sold but the proceeds must be used for the acquisition of similar type Institute collections  Exceptions to this requirement must be pre approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support  80200  Asset Acquisition Return to top  Equipment items that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Fixed Asset System can be acquired in the following ways  New Purchases Donations Transfer from other State Agencies Departments are responsible for making sure the equipment information is reported to the property management personnel in the Comptroller s Office  using an equipment record form All recordable assets should be reported to the Comptroller s Office upon receipt and acceptance  For equipment purchases  title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received  Similarly  for donated assets  title is considered to pass when the asset is available for use by the Institute and when the Institute assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset  80210  New Purchases Return to top  New purchases must be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if the asset meets the capitalization criteria or if the Institute determines it is a controllable asset  an asset that does not meet the capitalization criteria but because of its nature is more susceptible to theft or abuse  Equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds  Category I  must be recorded  regardless of the purchase amount as these assets serve as collateral for the bonds sold to acquire them  however  Category I assets must cost  500 or more and have a useful life of 3 years or more Equipment acquired with state or local funds other than Equipment Trust Funds  Category II  will be recorded if the purchase price is  2 000 or above  All computers will be recorded and tagged regardless of purchase cost  It is the responsibility of departments as well as the property management personnel to ensure that all asset acquisitions are recorded at the proper amount Documentation must be maintained in support of each asset amount assigned  80220  Acquisition Cost Return to top  Acquisition cost includes the purchase price  as well as cost incurred to place an asset in its intended location and in an operable condition Such costs associated with an asset would include freight and transportation charges  and or installation costs  Add any appropriate cost detailed above to the actual cost of the equipment  Acquisition cost is based on individual unit prices Assets should not be grouped  For example  three personal computers  PC  acquired for  2 000 each on one requisition would not be considered one capital asset with a value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and

for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each

80100  Overview of the Datatel Colleague Fixed Asset Module Return to top  The Datatel Colleague Fixed Assets Module is in place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy  A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year  Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment  80110  Land Buildings  Equipment and Intangible Assets Return to top  Capital assets include land  buildings and other improvements  library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year the expense is incurred  Interest expense relating to construction is capitalized net of interest income earned on resources set aside for this purpose  The costs of normal maintenance and repairs that do not add to an asset s value or materially extend its useful life are not capitalized  The Institute capitalizes moveable equipment at a value or initial cost of  5 000 or more and an estimated useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions    Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy  Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below  Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library materials  Intangible assets  50 years  10 30 years  5 25 years  10 years  5 years to indefinite  Generally the acquisition of land  land improvements  buildings and building improvement assets require the special approvals  authorizations  and appropriations of the Commonwealth of Virginia s capital outlay projects policies and procedures These special procedures are necessary for all such acquisitions in excess of  1 000 000 or as amended by the Commonwealth  in compliance with the 2008 Acts of Assembly  Chapter 879  Section 4 4 01m 6 a  The Comptroller s office will review all of these project expenditures and uses the general contractor s  schedule of values  to determine how to capitalize these projects  Construction project costs are accumulated and reported in the  Construction In Progress  asset category until the project is substantially complete and the related asset is actually put into service  The costs in the construction in progress account are reclassified into the various fixed asset categories as appropriate  buildings which includes building improvements  land improvements and equipment  Buildings  land improvements and equipment are recorded in the Colleague Finance General Ledger  Land and construction in progress are not recorded in Colleague Finance  however  journal entries are prepared to update the general ledger with summary totals  80120  Institute Owned Works of Art  Historical Treasurers and Similar Assets Return to top  The Institute does not capitalize works of art  historical treasurers and similar assets  Such items are held for public exhibition  education or research in the furtherance of public service rather than financial gain  Institute collections may be sold but the proceeds must be used for the acquisition of similar type Institute collections  Exceptions to this requirement must be pre approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support  80200  Asset Acquisition Return to top  Equipment items that meet the criteria for inclusion in the Fixed Asset System can be acquired in the following ways  New Purchases Donations Transfer from other State Agencies Departments are responsible for making sure the equipment information is reported to the property management personnel in the Comptroller s Office  using an equipment record form All recordable assets should be reported to the Comptroller s Office upon receipt and acceptance  For equipment purchases  title is considered to pass at the date the equipment is received  Similarly  for donated assets  title is considered to pass when the asset is available for use by the Institute and when the Institute assumes responsibility for maintaining the asset  80210  New Purchases Return to top  New purchases must be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if the asset meets the capitalization criteria or if the Institute determines it is a controllable asset  an asset that does not meet the capitalization criteria but because of its nature is more susceptible to theft or abuse  Equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds  Category I  must be recorded  regardless of the purchase amount as these assets serve as collateral for the bonds sold to acquire them  however  Category I assets must cost  500 or more and have a useful life of 3 years or more Equipment acquired with state or local funds other than Equipment Trust Funds  Category II  will be recorded if the purchase price is  2 000 or above  All computers will be recorded and tagged regardless of purchase cost  It is the responsibility of departments as well as the property management personnel to ensure that all asset acquisitions are recorded at the proper amount Documentation must be maintained in support of each asset amount assigned  80220  Acquisition Cost Return to top  Acquisition cost includes the purchase price  as well as cost incurred to place an asset in its intended location and in an operable condition Such costs associated with an asset would include freight and transportation charges  and or installation costs  Add any appropriate cost detailed above to the actual cost of the equipment  Acquisition cost is based on individual unit prices Assets should not be grouped  For example  three personal computers  PC  acquired for  2 000 each on one requisition would not be considered one capital asset with a value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item  Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more  80300  Asset Classification Return to top  Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets  Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms  80310  Components Return to top  Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category  A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value  Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets  A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis  Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed  Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location  The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records  The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory  Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented  Departments must submit revisions to the individual responsible for the property management function whenever permanent changes to the below listed information fields occur  Ownership Location Responsible Person Asset Operability 80420  Compliance Reporting Return to top  The Deputy Superintendent for Finance  Administration and Support reports semi annually  in December and May of each fiscal year  to the Audit  Finance and Planning Committee of the Board of Visitors on the status of VMI s compliance with the policies set forth in this Manual All departments will have 60 working days to complete their inventories   Departments that do not complete their inventory within this allocated time and make no other arrangements due to extenuating circumstances will be considered noncompliant with these policies and procedures and will be cited in this report 80430  Inventory Staffing Return to top  A responsible person must be assigned to each asset item recorded in the Fixed Asset System This is to ensure that an individual within the Institute has responsibility for maintaining and safeguarding the asset  The responsible person may or may not be directly involved in using the asset  but is typically responsible for asset acquisition or disposition within a given area or department  Each department s inventory is available in Entrinsik  80440  Tagging Return to top  Tagging provides a method of assigning a unique identification number to each fixed asset equipment item  in order for the item to be accounted for and identified within the Fixed Asset System Numbers will be assigned in consecutive order without regard to asset type or location  Bar coded tags have been integrated to facilitate the inventory process  Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag  The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired  Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible  It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged  80500  Surplus Property Return to top  All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property This does not include broken  cannibalized  or otherwise non functional items unless those items are fixed assets or retain a market value for use as spare parts  scrap metal  etc  Assets not in operable condition may also be classified as surplus  Ultimately  surplus property will be sold  repaired  scrapped  transferred to another department or state agency  sold to an institute of Higher Education  or donated to an approved 501 c   3  organization or another governmental agency  Procurement Services is responsible for the disposition of surplus property and Physical Plant is responsible for the relocation of surplus for the Institute into secure storage areas obtained by the requesting department  Disposition methods for surplus property are  Transfer to another VMI department    Sell or transfer to another state agency    Sell or transfer to local governmental entity    Sell to a recycler if the items have no functional market value  Donate to a qualifying IRC 501 c 3  organization  and Public sale by various methods  All assets must be formally reclassified once VMI determines they   a Have served their useful purpose   b  Are no longer functional   c Cannot be repaired or improved in a cost effective manner  and or  d  Are not needed for use at the Institute  Those assets so categorized will be classified as surplus and moved to Institute storage  Departments must complete a Disposition of Equipment Form in its entirety and attach surplus property labels to equipment to be surplused The completed form shall be submitted to the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  The Surplus Property Officer will review these forms and determine whether the items meet the definition of surplus property  In some cases  the Surplus Property Officer will physically examine the items before making a determination  Computers and printers will be evaluated by Information Technology before disposition is determined  If the items are deemed to be surplus property as defined herein  the Surplus Property Officer will send a surplus property label to the department to attach to the top front of the equipment in plain view  The disposing department will initiate a Physical Plant Work Order to have the item picked up In some cases large or bulky items may be left in the department until final disposition  Items tagged to be sold will be sold on an  as is where is  basis  Departments will be responsible for providing clear pictures and pertinent details of equipment to be sent to Procurement  If the items do not meet the definition of surplus property  they will be disposed of in accordance with the appropriate method for scrap or salvage  Notification of pending disposal must be emailed to surplus vmi edu by the responsible Equipment Coordinator  Upon approval from the Surplus Property Officer and the Department Head  a Physical Plant Work Order will be submitted for disposal by the originator of the request  Upon final disposition of a fixed asset  the Surplus Property Officer will complete and sign the Disposition of Equipment Form  attach any relevant documentation  and send the complete packet to the Fixed Assets Officer for entry into the accounting records  If the equipment is being transferred between departments  an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form must be completed and forwarded directly to the Comptroller s Office for processing Computers that are returned to Information Technology must have the Transfer Form attached to the computer  The department receiving the equipment shall sign and forward the form to the Fixed Asset Officer  A Disposition of Equipment Form shall be completed when damaged equipment will be replaced by the original vendor  Surplus records will be reviewed routinely and equipment will be disposed as necessary  A list of surplus items that are available can be requested from the Surplus Property Officer  Surplus property will be distributed to the departments on a first come  first serve basis  80600  Asset Disposal Return to top  As determined by the Surplus Property Officer  Fixed Assets can be disposed of in one of five ways  Sell or Trade in Abandonment  Scrapped Salvaged  Transfer Casualty Loss Cannibalization Assets no longer in possession of the department as a result of one of these five means of disposal will be removed from the Fixed Asset system and considered disposed  All disposals of assets must be carefully controlled and approved by the Surplus Property Officer in Procurement Services  Although each specific method of disposal contains some slight variation  the basic disposal procedures are the same The department controlling the Fixed Asset at the time of disposal is responsible for notifying the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer using a Disposition of Equipment Form 80610  Sell or Trade In Return to top  Surplus assets may be sold to another state agency  local governmental entity  or through a public auction The Institute may be able to upgrade existing items by trading in one asset for another  The trade in of the old asset is processed as a disposal and the new asset is entered into the Fixed Asset System at the invoiced price  which should reflect not only the cash paid but the undepreciated value of the asset traded in  80620  Abandonment  Return to top  Fixed assets retaining no salvage or disposal value will occasionally be discarded or abandoned as scrap as determined by the Surplus Property Officer and or the Fixed Assets Officer  80630 Transfers  Return to top  Permanent transfer of fixed assets within the Institute must be identified by the department as transfers are made Any changes need to be reported to Fixed Assets Officer using an Equipment Transfer Replacement Form  These modifications include changes in room number  building  department  responsible person  etc  80640 Casualty Loss  Return to top  Fixed Asset items that are destroyed by fire or other catastrophic circumstances must be removed from the records by submitting the Disposition of Equipment Form to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer  80650  Cannibalization Return to top  In some cases  fixed assets which are no longer functional are cannibalized to obtain parts that can be utilized to repair other like assets The original item is considered surplus and disposed of by cannibalization after approval from the Surplus Property Officer or the Fixed Asset Officer  80700 Lost or Stolen Return to top  Fixed asset items which are unaccounted for following verification of the inventory report must be removed from the inventory database Items that are known to be lost or stolen must be reported to Post Police immediately and the appropriate theft report information must be forwarded to the Surplus Property Officer and the Fixed Assets Officer Fixed Asset

Module is in place to ensure that fixed assets are acquired  controlled  accounted for and disposed of in the best interest of the Institute  and in accordance with State policy A fixed asset is defined as Institute property of any kind that is complete in and of itself  does not lose its identity or become a component of another fixed asset  and is of a durable nature with an expected service life of more than one year Categories of fixed assets include land  buildings  equipment and intangible assets The policies and procedures in this section apply primarily to equipment 80110

library materials  equipment  infrastructure assets such as sidewalks  steam tunnels  and electrical and computer network cabling systems  and intangible assets  The Institute capitalizes construction costs that have a value or cost in excess of  100 000 at the date of acquisition  Renovations in excess of  100 000 are capitalized if they significantly extend the useful life of the existing asset  Expenses for major capital assets and improvements are capitalized  construction in progress  as projects are constructed  Routine repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense in the year

useful life in excess of two years  Buildings and equipment are stated at appraised value or actual cost where determinable  Land is stated at cost  Library materials are valued using published average prices for library acquisitions Intangible assets are those assets that have no physical existence such as computer software  water rights  timber rights  patents  copyrights  and trademarks  Intangible assets that are developed or purchased  have a useful life of one or more years  and have an acquisition cost of  100 000 or more will be capitalized under this policy Depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset  Average useful lives by asset categories are listed below Buildings  Other improvements  Equipment  Library

value of  6 000  Instead  each would be considered a separate acquisition of  2 000  Each PC would be entered into the Fixed Asset System as a separate controllable item Donated assets should be recorded in the Fixed Asset System if their fair market value is  2 000 or more 80300  Asset Classification Return to top  80300  Asset Classification Return to top Assets with an expected useful life of greater than one year and a value or cost of  5 000 or more at the date of acquisition are considered capitalizable assets Assets with an expected life of greater than one year and a value between  2 000 and  5 000 at the date of acquisition are considered controllable assets As explained earlier  equipment acquired with Equipment Trust Funds is entered into the fixed asset module even if its value is less than  2 000  Certain other assets may be controlled when their value is less than  2 000 if they are more susceptible to theft or abuse such as PC s  camera equipment or firearms 80310  Components Return to top  80310  Components Return to top Due care and diligence should be exercised in determining whether an item is a separate piece of equipment having its own recorded cost and description  or is a component included as part of the cost and description of the overall asset The majority of items fall into the first category A component part is a part of a unit of equipment that cannot be used independently of another piece of equipment or is physically connected to another asset This definition applies even though the component part may meet the capitalization criteria by itself  For example  a personal computer  PC  consists of a Central Processing Unit  CPU  monitor  and keyboard  This is considered to be one unit consisting of three parts or components  none of which is typically used independently  Therefore  the total cost of the three components of the PC should be recorded with a tag attached to the CPU  Under normal conditions  if one of the pieces had to be replaced  it would either be covered under a maintenance contract and no cost would be incurred or the cost would be comparable to the piece being replaced  and there would be no change to the recorded asset value Certain types of equipment may be used with a number of other types of equipment For example  a telephoto camera lens may be used on any of a number of cameras separately inventoried and tagged  ADP equipment is another area in which there may be equipment components  such as a printer connected to a mainframe  The key difference is that these items can operate on many different pieces of equipment  and the equipment to which they are attached can operate independent of the component  e g  the camera can operate with or without the telephoto lens and the mainframe can operate with or without the printer  Therefore  in the truest sense  the item is not a component of the system  It is a separate piece of equipment  In these instances  if the item meets the criteria for capitalization or control as an individual item  it should be separately recorded and tagged as a fixed asset equipment item 80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top  80400  Asset Control and Management Return to top As stewards of the Commonwealth s assets  we are required to perform periodic physical inventories The objectives of a physical inventory are to ensure that the fixed assets physically exist  to determine if unrecorded or improperly recorded transactions have occurred  and to identify any excess  defective or obsolete assets on hand  An effective inventory results in an accurate accounting of fixed assets  and indicates the reliability of the system of accountability for the acquisition  use  and disposal of those assets A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Each department will be assigned an anniversary month when the inventory will either be completed by the Comptroller s Office or the department itself  Inventories of assets which are susceptible to error or irregularities should be conducted on a more frequent basis A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability A physical inventory of fixed assets will be conducted every year in order to properly safeguard assets and maintain fiscal accountability Circumstances may arise that require VMI employees to use State owned equipment at their home or some location other than the VMI Post With the exception of notebook computers taken on VMI business trips  such occurrences should be rare  However  if such a need does arise  an Off Post Equipment Agreement Form should be completed  This form documents the need as well as the authorization for such use  It should be completed and forwarded to the Comptroller s Office  During the process of conducting physical inventories  employees with state owned equipment in their home may be required to temporarily return them for inspection 80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top  80410  Guidelines for Conducting Physical Inventories Return to top The following general guidelines have been established to ensure that a physical inventory will be effectively implemented and performed Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory  Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area  Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary  Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location Property management personnel will establish a timetable and coordinate the effort necessary to conduct the inventory Responsible persons should assist in conducting physical inventories in their respective area Discrepancies between recorded and actual inventories must be resolved in a timely manner through the submission of revised input forms and tagging  if necessary Each item recorded is physically inspected for changes in condition or location The physical inventory must verify the asset s existence  and should provide a reference to lists and or other documents evidencing the existence and cost of the asset examined Procedures must include verification from the list to ensure the physical existence of listed assets and from the physical assets back to the list to ensure all assets physically in existence are recorded in the inventory records The following detailed guidelines are provided for conducting the inventory Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas where assets may be stored or located  All equipment located in an area will be examined for an asset tag number and traced back to the inventory listing Tagged items in a room which are reported on the inventory report as located elsewhere will require a revision to record the change of location  If tagged items are missing from the inventory listing  or if untagged items are identified as meeting the fixed asset criteria as a capitalized or controlled asset  inventory information must be provided at that time for subsequent entry into the system  Items that are identified during the inventory as unrecorded or listed as a discrepancy will be sent by property management personnel   via email  to the departmental equipment coordinator for investigation  Responses are to be returned to property management personnel within a two week time period  If no response is received after two weeks  property management personnel will again contact the departmental equipment coordinator in addition to the department head via email for immediate response Departments failing to respond after two notifications will be reported to the Comptroller for further action  For items removed from the inventory because they are unaccounted for  an amount equivalent to the remaining book value may be deducted from the respective department s operating budget during the subsequent fiscal year  All areas will be examined for tagged  untagged  recorded or unrecorded items and the necessary changes processed by property management within 60 days from the start of the inventory process  Any items acquired with ETF monies that are lost  stolen  or broken  must be replaced within 90 days of the date they were discovered missing or broken  They must also be replaced with like equipment having a cost equal to or greater than the remaining book value of the original item  The replacement item will use the same tag ID and will not require a new one  However  a reason for the need of a replacement item must be documented Property management personnel will be permitted access to all areas

the inventory process Equipment Trust Fund purchases will be tagged with a yellow tag and will always begin with a  T All other equipment will be tagged with a silver tag The consecutive numbering allows each asset item within the Fixed Asset System to carry a unique number throughout its entire life regardless of change in location  responsible person  or other data elements assigned to the asset item  until such asset is retired or disposed Once disposal or retirement has occurred  the number is also retired Assets to be entered into the Fixed Asset System should be tagged at the time of physical receipt  or as soon thereafter as possible It is sometimes impractical to physically tag certain equipment items such as camera lenses and data boards Such assets may include heat sensitive or finely tuned components that might become impaired if an inventory tag is placed on them  These assets will still be assigned a unique identification number for input purposes but will not be physically tagged 80500  Surplus Property Return to top  80500  Surplus Property Return to top All Institute property that is no longer used by the Department is considered surplus property
