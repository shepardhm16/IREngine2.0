the TI Calculators  up to the 89  or comparable calculator  see me  but be prepared to justify all calculations  Work for Grade  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse

Calculus   Analytic Geometry I Text  Thomas  Calculus with Early Transcendentals  by Finney  Weir  Giordano  10th edition Time  TR 0930 1045  Section 5  TR 1315 1430  Section 6  Location  MH454  Both Sections  Office Hours  MWF 0900 0950  MF 1100 1150 Syllabus Preliminaries In order to proceed through the topics in Calculus II  one must understand how derivatives work and how to compute them  See the topics from MA 115  Calculus I for review if necessary  Reading the book is a must  There will not be sufficient in class time to cover all details and examples  Optimally  one should read the material corresponding to the calendar before coming to the class  Goals of the Course By the end of MA 116  one should be able to  Model and optimize geometrical problems Compute Riemann sums Understand applications of integrals Compute integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and integration techniques Apply integration theory to the computation of areas  volumes  lengths  moments and center of mass Topics Chapter 3  Modeling  Optimization  Linearization  Differentials Chapter 4  Integration including Riemann sums and Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Chapter 5  Applications including volumes of revolution  arc length  moments and center of mass Chapter 6  Integration of logarithms  exponential  and hyperbolic functions Chapter 7  Integration techniques including substitution  integration by parts  trigonometric substitution  and improper integrals  Grading Throughout the semester  in class quizzes and 4 in class tests and will be given  see calendar for approximate dates  NOTE  The lowest three quiz grades will be dropped  A final exam will be given during final exam week  Your grade will computed in two ways  as follows  and the higher grade

comparable calculator  see me  but be prepared to justify all calculations  Work for Grade  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  According to the Departmental Statement Concerning VMI Policies Regarding Work for Grade  software packages are not permitted  This means on all tests  all work must be shown  Calculators may be used to check answers but unsubstantiated answers  as from a calculator  will receive no credit  Homework Possible Quiz and Test problems On the calendar the dates of the quizzes are listed  One problem from will be chosen

Section 5  TR 1315 1430  Section 6  Location  MH454  Both Sections  Office Hours  MWF 0900 0950  MF 1100 1150 Syllabus Preliminaries In order to proceed through the topics in Calculus II  one must understand how derivatives work and how to compute them  See the topics from MA 115  Calculus I for review if necessary  Reading the book is a must  There will not be sufficient in class time to cover all details and examples  Optimally  one should read the material corresponding to the calendar before coming to the class  Goals of the Course By the end of MA 116  one should be able to  Model and optimize geometrical problems Compute Riemann sums Understand applications of integrals Compute integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and integration techniques Apply integration theory to the computation of areas  volumes  lengths  moments and center of mass Topics Chapter 3  Modeling  Optimization  Linearization  Differentials Chapter 4  Integration including Riemann sums and Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Chapter 5  Applications including volumes of revolution  arc length  moments and center of mass Chapter 6  Integration of logarithms  exponential  and hyperbolic functions Chapter 7  Integration techniques including substitution  integration by parts  trigonometric substitution  and improper integrals  Grading Throughout the semester  in class quizzes and 4 in class tests and will be given  see calendar for approximate dates  NOTE  The lowest three quiz grades will be dropped  A final exam will be given during final exam week  Your grade will computed in two ways  as follows  and the higher grade will be given  Each in class test   14  Quizzes  14  Final exam 30  or Each in class test   10  Quizzes  10  Final exam 50  Calculators You may use any of the TI Calculators  up to the 89  or comparable calculator  see me  but be prepared to justify all calculations  Work for Grade  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  According to the Departmental Statement Concerning VMI Policies Regarding Work for Grade  software packages are not permitted  This means on all tests  all work must be shown  Calculators may be used to check answers but unsubstantiated answers  as from a calculator  will receive no credit  Homework Possible Quiz and Test problems On the calendar the dates of the quizzes are listed  One problem

understand how derivatives work and how to compute them  See the topics from MA 115  Calculus I for review if necessary  Reading the book is a must  There will not be sufficient in class time to cover all details and examples  Optimally  one should read the material corresponding to the calendar before coming to the class  Goals of the Course By the end of MA 116  one should be able to Preliminaries   before   Goals of the Course  Model and optimize geometrical problems Compute Riemann sums Understand applications of integrals Compute integrals using the Fundamental Theorem of

quizzes and 4 in class tests and will be given  see calendar for approximate dates  NOTE  The lowest three quiz grades will be dropped  A final exam will be given during final exam week  Your grade will computed in two ways  as follows  and the higher grade will be given Grading  Each in class test   14  Quizzes  14  Final exam 30  or Each in class test   10  Quizzes  10  Final exam 50  Calculators You may use any of the TI Calculators  up to the 89  or comparable calculator  see me  but be prepared to justify all calculations  Work for Grade  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  According to the Departmental Statement Concerning VMI Policies Regarding Work for Grade  software packages are not permitted  This means on all tests  all work must be shown  Calculators may be used to check answers but unsubstantiated answers  as from a calculator  will receive no credit     Calculators    Work for Grade  Work for grade  Cadet s
