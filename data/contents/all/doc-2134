distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed program of intercollegiate athletics is maintained  VMI

Bylaw 14 4  Upper class cadet athletes are similarly certified each semester by VMI  Cadets who do not participate in varsity athletics are encouraged to participate in club sports or other athletic programs  Athletic competition develops the cadets physically and enhances their team building skills  This is an essential aspect of VMI s method of developing leadership in each of our cadets  Club

program designed  organized  and supervised by the VMI Department of Physical Education  The program is designed to foster self confidence and physical conditioning in new cadets by creating training situations  stressful enough to demonstrate that they are capable of performing tasks  which surpass their previously self imposed mental and physical limits  New cadets can expect to run distances  as much as 5 miles  conduct a forced march up a mountain  fight with pugil sticks  wrestle in a muddy pit  make a high level entry into water  negotiate a number of group and individual obstacles  run two obstacle courses  and rock climb and rappel  approximately 150 feet  The day to day operation of the program is administered by upperclass cadets  cadre  in order to provide opportunities in leading and teaching activities  which have calculated elements of risk  making safety and professionalism paramount  Many of the activities are derivatives of  Outward Bound  and various military training programs  Participation in  Rat Challenge  is mandatory during the fall semester for all new cadets not involved in intercollegiate athletics  The program is conducted twice a week from 4 p m

Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed program of intercollegiate athletics is maintained  VMI is a member of the Big South

various colleges and universities throughout the country and fall under the guidance of the Office of Cadet Life  Rat Challenge  Rat Challenge  is an outdoor experiential program designed  organized  and supervised by the VMI Department of Physical Education  The program is designed to foster self confidence and physical conditioning in new cadets by creating training situations  stressful enough to demonstrate that they are capable of performing tasks  which surpass their previously self imposed mental and physical limits  New cadets can expect to run distances  as much as 5 miles  conduct a forced march up a mountain  fight with pugil sticks  wrestle in a muddy pit  make a high level entry into water  negotiate a number of group and individual obstacles  run two obstacle courses  and rock climb and rappel  approximately 150 feet  The day to day operation of the program is administered by upperclass cadets  cadre  in order to provide opportunities in leading and teaching activities  which have calculated elements of risk  making safety and professionalism paramount  Many of the activities are derivatives of  Outward Bound  and various military training programs  Participation in

honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed program of intercollegiate athletics is maintained  VMI is a member of the Big South

distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to

Cadet System Absences From Duty Activities The distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat

ARCHIVED CATALOG  The Co Curricular Program Print Friendly Page Student Government Barracks Life Military System The New Cadet System Absences From Duty Activities The distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed program of intercollegiate athletics is maintained  VMI is a member of the Big South Conference for most sports  All sports compete at the NCAA Division I level  Teams are fielded in baseball  basketball  men s and women s cross country  football  lacrosse  men s and women s rifle  men s and women s soccer  men s and women s swimming  men s and women s indoor track  men s and women s outdoor track  women s water polo and wrestling  Every cadet is welcomed as a candidate for participation in any sport in which he  she may be interested  All athletes must meet certain academic standards prior to participating in intercollegiate competition  Freshmen are certified by the NCAA Eligibility Center in accordance with NCAA Bylaw 14 3 prior to initial intercollegiate competition and then each semester thereafter by VMI in accordance with NCAA Bylaw 14 4  Upper class cadet athletes are similarly certified each semester by VMI  Cadets who do not participate in varsity athletics are encouraged to participate in club sports or other athletic programs  Athletic competition develops the cadets physically and enhances their team building skills  This is an essential aspect of VMI s method of developing leadership in each of our cadets  Club sports compete with clubs at various colleges and universities throughout the country and fall under the guidance of the Office of Cadet Life  Rat Challenge  Rat Challenge  is an outdoor experiential program designed  organized  and supervised by the VMI Department of Physical Education  The program is designed to foster self confidence and physical conditioning in new cadets by creating training situations  stressful enough to demonstrate that they are capable of performing tasks  which surpass their previously self imposed mental and physical limits  New cadets can expect to run distances  as much as 5 miles  conduct a forced march up a mountain  fight with pugil sticks  wrestle in a muddy pit  make a high level entry into water  negotiate a number of group and individual obstacles  run two obstacle courses  and rock climb and rappel  approximately 150 feet  The day to day operation of the program is administered by upperclass cadets  cadre  in order to provide opportunities in leading and teaching activities  which have calculated elements of risk  making safety and professionalism paramount  Many of the activities are derivatives of  Outward Bound  and various military training programs  Participation in  Rat Challenge  is mandatory during the fall semester for all new cadets not involved in intercollegiate athletics  The program is conducted twice a week from 4 p m  to 6 p m  during the fall semester

some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed

Military System The New Cadet System Absences From Duty Activities The distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest

 punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military

that will contribute to the total quality of cadet life  Musical Organizations Opportunities are plentiful for cadets with musical interests  both as participants and as listeners  The VMI Glee Club presents concerts on Post and throughout the eastern United States  They appear on telecasts  tape cassette and CD albums  and in concerts at alumni gatherings and at various colleges  within the club is a small select group  The Sentinels  The Regimental Band organized into its own company of 152 cadets within the Corps and provides music for ceremonies on Post as well as for athletic events  It

Military System The New Cadet System Absences From Duty Activities The distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed program of intercollegiate athletics is maintained  VMI is a member of the Big South Conference for most sports  All sports compete at the NCAA Division I level  Teams are fielded in baseball  basketball  men s and women s cross country  football  lacrosse  men s and women s rifle  men s and women s soccer  men s and women s swimming  men s and women s indoor track  men s and women s outdoor track  women s water polo and wrestling  Every cadet is welcomed as a candidate for participation in any sport in which he  she may be interested  All athletes must meet certain academic standards prior to participating in intercollegiate competition  Freshmen are certified by the NCAA Eligibility Center in accordance with NCAA Bylaw 14 3 prior to initial intercollegiate competition and then each semester thereafter by VMI in accordance with NCAA Bylaw 14 4  Upper class cadet athletes are similarly certified each semester by VMI  Cadets who do not participate in varsity athletics are encouraged to participate in club sports or other athletic programs  Athletic competition develops the cadets physically and enhances their team building skills  This is an essential aspect of VMI s method of developing leadership in each of our cadets  Club sports compete with clubs at various colleges and universities throughout the country and fall under the guidance of the Office of Cadet Life  Rat Challenge  Rat Challenge  is an outdoor experiential program designed  organized  and supervised by the VMI Department of Physical Education  The program is designed to foster self confidence and physical conditioning in new cadets by creating training situations  stressful enough to demonstrate that they are capable of performing tasks  which surpass their previously self imposed mental and physical limits  New cadets can expect to run distances  as much as 5 miles  conduct a forced march up a mountain  fight with pugil sticks  wrestle in a muddy pit  make a high level entry into water  negotiate a number of group and individual obstacles  run two obstacle courses  and rock climb and rappel  approximately 150 feet  The day to day operation of the program is administered by upperclass cadets  cadre  in order to provide opportunities in leading and teaching activities  which have calculated elements of risk  making safety and professionalism paramount  Many of the activities are derivatives of  Outward Bound  and various military training programs  Participation in  Rat Challenge  is mandatory during the fall semester for all new cadets not involved in intercollegiate athletics  The program is conducted twice a week from 4 p m  to 6 p m  during the fall semester  Cadet Publications Cadets write  edit  and manage the following periodic publications  The Bomb  yearbook established in 1885 as the first college annual in the South  The Cadet  weekly newspaper established in 1907  Religious Services Numerous opportunities are provided

not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic ability  a highly developed

Absences From Duty Activities The distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it

 College Democrats  Golf  Lacrosse  Martial Arts  Women s   Men s Rugby  Wrestling  Jiu Jitsu  Marathon  Powerlifting  Triathlon  Ultimate  Trap   Skeet  Men in Grey  Jazz Band  Boxing  Ice Hockey  Soccer  and Basketball  VMI is committed to providing opportunities for all cadets to participate in clubs  organizations  and extracurricular activities that will contribute to the total quality of cadet life  Musical Organizations Opportunities are plentiful for cadets with musical interests  both as participants and as listeners  The VMI Glee Club presents concerts on Post and throughout the eastern United States  They appear on telecasts  tape cassette and CD albums  and in concerts at alumni gatherings and at various colleges  within the club is a small select group  The Sentinels  The Regimental Band organized into its own company of 152 cadets within the Corps and provides music for ceremonies on Post as well as for athletic events  It has an impressive record of award winning performances across the state  country  and abroad  The band also performs in Presidential and Gubernatorial inaugural parades in Washington and Richmond  Within the band are smaller units such as the

and mixers  The Office of Cadet Life also oversees many social events throughout the year to include the Midwinter Formal  Ring Figure Weekend  Homecoming Hop and the Cadet Life Ski Trip Student Government Barracks Life Military System The New Cadet System Absences From Duty Activities The distinctive VMI approach to higher education  which is the result of over 170 years of development  continues to prove its effectiveness in providing young men and women an environment that fosters intellectual  physical  and character development  The unique cadet lifestyle and all non academic activities comprise the co curricular program  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  they live in Barracks  and eat their meals in a dining facility  Because military training is combined at the Institute with a demanding academic program  cadet life requires much of the individual  For cadets to fully achieve their educational goals  it is essential that cadets willingly accept the military way of life found at the Institute  VMI s mission is to produce  citizen soldiers  men and women educated for civilian life and also prepared to serve their country in the Armed Forces  Historically about 20 percent of VMI graduates have made the military a career  However  approximately 50 percent are commissioned each year upon graduation  Cadets must take four years of ROTC instruction and are encouraged to take a commission in the service of their choice  but commissioning is not mandatory  STUDENT GOVERNMENT The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  The Honor Court The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  The Cadet Regiment The third major agency of student government at VMI is the Cadet Regiment  made up of two battalions of four rifle companies each plus the regimental band  The basic structure of the corps is that of an infantry unit  and all cadets drill as infantry troops under their own leaders  On the basis of demonstrated qualities of leadership and proficiency in military and academic studies  cadets are appointed to non commissioned and commissioned cadet rank  The First Captain  as the highest ranking cadet  commands the regiment  A major share of the administration of the Corps of Cadets is entrusted to cadet officers and their staffs  BARRACKS LIFE The Barracks is the focal point of a cadet s life at VMI  and the fact that all cadets are required to live under one roof facilitates student government and helps promote and strengthen ties of friendship  Rooms are furnished sparingly but with essential equipment  and three  four  five or six cadets share a room  They have equal responsibility for keeping the room clean and in order for daily inspection  Personal items authorized in cadet rooms vary by class  For example  only First Class cadets may keep civilian clothes in their rooms  Fourth Class cadets may not keep electrical equipment  such as razors  radios and videogame systems  If personal items are brought to VMI and found to be unauthorized  limited storage space for these items is provided until such time as they are authorized  MILITARY SYSTEM The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  The combination of military and academic training constitutes a strenuous program requiring diligent application and conscientious attention to both academic and military duties  For a cadet to derive the greatest benefit from what is admittedly a heavy program  absences from the post and from Lexington are limited  The military system of administration of the Cadet Corps extends wide authority to individuals and holds all responsible for faithful exercise of assigned duties  The characteristic dependability of the VMI graduate results from life within this framework of authority and responsibility  Although they have some features in common  the military system should not be confused with the system of new cadet orientation  which is briefly described below  THE NEW CADET SYSTEM One of the Institute s oldest traditions is the system of initiation applied to new cadets by old cadets  who themselves have successfully completed it  Regardless of background or prior academic training  every cadet in the first year at VMI is a  rat  and must live under the  rat  system  Among its purposes are to teach or promote the following in the shortest span of time possible  Excellence in all things  particularly academics  Military bearing  discipline  and conduct  Self control  humility  and self restraint  Respect for authority and the forms of military courtesy  Habits of neatness  cleanliness  orderliness  punctuality  and the importance of attention to detail  The history and traditions of VMI and cadet life  Class unity and the  brother rat  spirit that result from shared experiences in a stern and challenging environment  The system is equal and impersonal in its application  tending to remove wealth and former station in life as factors in one s standing as a cadet  and ensuring equal opportunity for all to advance by personal effort and to enjoy those rewards that are earned  Throughout most of the  rat year  the new cadet walks at rigid attention a prescribed route inside barracks known as the  rat line  and double times up and down barracks stairs  The cadet must be meticulous in keeping shoes shined  uniform spotless  hair cut  and in daily personal grooming  The new cadet must memorize school songs  yells  and other information  ABSENCES FROM DUTY Although provisions are made for recreation and necessary absence  justice cannot be done to studies or to military obligations if these absences are frequent or long  Saturday afternoons and Sundays are usually free of scheduled activities  given that a cadet has not incurred restrictions  There are also opportunities during the week for afternoon visits to town  The summer  Thanksgiving  winter  and spring furloughs compare with similar vacation periods at other colleges  and should be used for such purposes as medical and dental appointments  when needed  During the second semester of the freshman year  a new cadet is allowed a weekend furlough  the number of such furloughs increase as the cadet advances toward the First Class  Athletic teams make trips to participate in games  and publications staffs are granted absences to conduct their business  Cadets who make the Dean s Honor List are eligible for special furloughs  Academic Days  and First Class cadets may make a limited number of trips to be interviewed by prospective employers and to visit their homes for personal matters  In addition to leaves of absence mentioned above  emergency leaves are allowed for the following reasons  Deaths in the immediate family  Urgent medical treatment of a specialized nature that cannot be obtained in Lexington  Critical illness in the immediate family when the family physician requests the presence of the cadet at home  Cadets and parents should realize that these rules are made and enforced for the benefit of the Corps as a whole and to improve the opportunities to learn  Therefore  parents should not ask permission for their son or daughter to be absent except as provided in the regulations  as absences disrupt academic work and cannot  in justice  be extended to one and denied another  ACTIVITIES Athletics For cadets of special athletic
