 There were over thirty cadets in attendance  which was awesome  I think the cadets were surprised when they found out that a guy dressed like he just finished working at the Third Barracks construction site all day was worth eight figures  Oliver spoke about how he became involved in real estate and gave us a lot of advice as he reached different parts in his speech  He emphasized that we should not be scared to change careers and should always be open to more than one thing in our lives  Seeing how his speech ended at about 2040  and he did not leave until 2130 because of all the questions  I feel the cadets really enjoyed the speech and were appreciative of all the advice and knowledge that Oliver was giving them  Thank you for all your support you have given SBD and ODE throughout the year  It is encouraging to know that everyone is behind what we are doing  Mr  Shaun Redgate SBD and ODE had their first event of September 11th  2007  The speaker was Mr  Shaun Redgate

became an Economics major and about working his way from a Portfolio Analyst to his current position  Private Client Manager  A few things he spoke out was communication among his clients  teamwork within the office  and being hungry aggressive in the search for new clients  The topic of speaking and writing well came up a couple times  and he mentioned it as one key to his success  I want to

clients  The topic of speaking and writing well came up a couple times  and he mentioned it as one key to his success  I want to thank you for your support and for encouraging your classes to attend

presented his ideas on the Pre industrial Economy and the Evolution of Modern Preferences as part of the Dean s Lecture Series  Dr  Clark is professor of economics at the University of California   Davis where teaches economic history  His research focuses on long run economic growth and the wealth of nations  Dr  Clark earned degrees from King s College  Cambridge  and Harvard  He is also the author of  A Farewell to Alms  A Brief Economic History of the World  The event  held in Moody Hall  was open to the public and sponsored by the Dean s Lecture Series  Mr Oliver Kuttner On March 27th  2008  SBD and ODE held their second speaking event of the school year  The speaker was Mr  Oliver Kuttner  a successful land developer from Charlottesville  VA  There were over thirty cadets in attendance  which was awesome  I think the cadets were surprised when they found out that a guy dressed like he just finished working at the Third Barracks construction site all day was worth eight figures  Oliver spoke about how he became involved in real estate and gave us a lot of advice as he reached different parts in his speech  He emphasized that we should not be scared to change careers and should always be open to more than one thing in our lives  Seeing how his speech ended at about 2040  and he did not leave until 2130 because of all the questions  I feel the cadets really enjoyed the speech and were appreciative of all the advice and knowledge that Oliver was giving them  Thank you for all your support you have given SBD and ODE throughout the year  It is encouraging to know that everyone is behind what we are doing  Mr  Shaun Redgate SBD and ODE had their first event of September 11th  2007  The speaker was Mr  Shaun Redgate  a Private Client Manager at US Trust  Bank of
