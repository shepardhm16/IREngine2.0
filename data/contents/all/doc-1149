Execution of John Brown Stonewall Jackson Eyewitness Account About this Document  This letter was written by Maj  Thomas Jackson  then on the faculty at the Virginia Military Institute  to his wife Mary Anna  The original letter is located in the Dabney Jackson collection at the Library of Virginia  It has been widely reprinted  there are minor editorial variations among different published versions  though no substantive differences  For one published source  see Life and Letters of Thomas J  Jackson by Mary Anna Jackson  NY  Harper  1892  More about this topic   December 2  1859  John Brown was hung today at about 11 1 2 A M  He behaved with unflinching firmness  The arrangements were well made under the direction of Col  Smith  Brown s wife visited him last evening  The body is to be delivered to her  The gibbet was south east of the town in a large field  Brown rode on the head of his coffin  from his prison to the place of execution  The coffin was of black walnut  enclosed in a poplar box of the same shape as the coffin  He was dressed in carpet slippers of predominating red  white socks  blacks pants  black frock coat  black vest   black slouch hat  Nothing around his neck beside his shirt collar  The open wagon in which he rode was strongly guarded on all sides  Capt  Williams  formerly one of the assistants of the Institute  marched immediately in front of the wagon  The jailer and high sheriff and several others rode in the wagon with the prisoner  Brown had his arms tied behind him    ascended the scaffold with apparent cheerfulness  After reaching the top of the platform  he shook hands with several who were standing around him  The sheriff placed the rope around his neck  then threw a white cap over his head   asked him if he wished a signal when all should be ready to which he replied that it made no difference  provided he was not kept waiting too long  In this condition he stood on the trap door  which was supported on one side by hinges  and on the other  south side  by a rope  for about 10 minutes  when Col  S  told the Sheriff  all is ready  which apparently was not comprehended by the Sheriff  and the Col  had to repeat the order  when the rope was cut by a single blow  and Brown fell through about 25 inches  so as to bring his knees on a level with the position occupied by his feet before the rope was cut  With the fall his arms below the elbow flew up  hands clenched    his arms gradually fell by spasmodic motions there was very little motion of his person for several minutes  after which the wind blew his lifeless body to   fro  His face  upon the scaffold  was turned a little east of south  and in front of him were the cadets commanded by Major Gilham  My command was still in front of the cadets  all facing south  One howitzer I assigned to Mr  Truheart on the left of the cadets  and with the other I remained on the right  Other troops occupied different positions around the scaffold  and altogether it was an imposing but very solemn scene  I was much impressed with the thought that before me stood a man  in the full vigor of health  who must in a few minutes be in eternity  I sent up a petition that he might be saved  Awful was the thought that he might in a few minutes receive the sentence  Depart ye wicked into everlasting fire  I hope that he was prepared to die  but I am very doubtful he wouldn t have a minister with him  His body was taken back to the jail  and at 6 p m  was sent to his wife at Harper s Ferry  When it reached Harper s Ferry the coffin was opened and his wife saw the body the coffin was again opened at the depot  before leaving for Baltimore  lest there should be an imposition  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
