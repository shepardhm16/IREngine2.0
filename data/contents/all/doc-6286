involved the development of a three dimensional numerical simulation of a swimming fish  accompanied by experimental work in building a mechanical fish  One possible use for a mechanical fish in defense applications is for less detectable transportation for clandestine operations such as infiltration of SEAL team members into enemy harbors  It could also be used as a silent torpedo  This is the VMI mechanical fish  built on a frame and motor developed previuosly at Michigan State University  The body was developed by cadets Darren Wellner and Chris Petree  06  The animation above shows a depiction of a fish utilizing approximately 1000 points to describe a series of ellipses of various dimensions from the front to the rear of the fish  This fish consists of 59 ellipses  the dimensions of which are controlled by splines on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the fish  Altogether  there are 6 degrees of freedom involved in determining the shape of the fish  With the shape defined  this model can be moved in any shape desired  such as the sinusoidal motion in the animation above    The overall objective of this research is to correlate the measured movements of the fish with equations which have already been developed related to the motion of fish in the water  The results of the equations for a reange of assumptions are shown below  More data is needed from experiments involving the movement of the fish in order to validate the equations  This is an original prototype of the fish developed at Michigan State University  It was covered with flexible skin that proved to be too flexible  and bulged in as the depth of the fish increased  This caused the fish to displace less volume  making it less buoyant which perpetuated the cycle  A more rigid body was needed  hence the VMI fiberglass fish  Many studies have been performed regarding self propulsion of biological organisms  These include studies of all different sizes and types of creatures in both air and water media  The present research focuses only on neutrally buoyant organisms in an incompressible fluid  Considering only this portion of this spectrum of bio mechanical self propulsion  there are three major groups of cases which can be studied  as discussed by Fauci and Peskin  1  Within the realm of large Reynolds numbers  several methods have been used in analyzing bio mechanical propulsion  One of the first of these was set forth by Lighthill  2  which is a  small displacement  model  Figure 1  Top view of a swimming fish  showing the coordinate system used  The origin is at the head of the fish and the y dimension is vertical  out of the page  The equation for total average power required for the fish to move with a displacement h x t  is developed by Lighthill is Likewise  the efficiency of the swimming body can be computed as the ratio of the amount of power available for propulsion to the total amount of power expended by the fish  Since the amount of power expended in propulsion is P   TU  the efficiency of swimming can be expressed as   Standing Wave Body Shape  In order to calculate the equilibrium velocity U  or efficiency of any swimming motion  an assumption about the shape and nature of movement of the fish must be assumed  Several shapes were investigated as part of this research  The first shape investigated was that of a standing wave  Figure 2 shows examples of the shape of the fish for various values of c  Figure 2  Three top views of the centerline of a swimming fish  each with a different value of c  the curvature coefficient  Figure 3 shows a plot of the equilibrium velocity of the fish as a function of curvature coefficient for various values of amplitude  B  The velocity tends toward zero for c   p and c   2p  but is a maximum at c   3p  2  This corresponds with a zero slope at the end of the tail  The larger amplitudes bring about larger equilibrium velocities  however amplitudes larger than those shown here would be difficult to consider as  small  The velocities shown are for a frequency of oscillation of w   1  Figure 4 shows the swimming efficiency for the same parameters used in Figure 3  As with velocity  the efficiency is a maximum at c   2p  3  corresponding to a zero slope on the tail at all times  It should be noted here that the amplitude of the movement of the body has no affect on efficiency since the amplitude cancels out of the numerator and denominator of the expression for efficiency  Figure 3  Steady state velocity of the fish  as a function of curvature coefficient  at various amplitudes of

involved the development of a three dimensional numerical simulation of a swimming fish  accompanied by experimental work in building a mechanical fish  One possible use for a mechanical fish in defense applications is for less detectable transportation for clandestine operations such as infiltration of SEAL team members into enemy harbors  It could also be used as a silent torpedo  This is the VMI mechanical fish  built on a frame and motor developed previuosly at Michigan State University  The body was developed by cadets Darren Wellner and Chris Petree  06  The animation above shows a depiction of a fish utilizing approximately 1000 points to describe a series of ellipses of various dimensions from the front to the rear of the fish  This fish consists of 59 ellipses  the dimensions of which are controlled by splines on the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the fish  Altogether  there are 6 degrees of freedom involved in determining the shape of the fish  With the shape defined  this model can be moved in any shape desired  such as the sinusoidal motion in the animation above    The overall objective of this research is to correlate the measured movements of the fish with equations which have already been developed related to the motion of fish in the water  The results of the equations for a reange of assumptions are shown below  More data is needed from experiments involving the movement of the fish in order to validate the equations  This is an original prototype of the fish developed at Michigan State University  It was covered with flexible skin that proved to be too flexible  and bulged in as the depth of the fish increased  This caused the fish to displace less volume  making it less buoyant which perpetuated the cycle  A more rigid body was needed  hence the VMI fiberglass fish  Many studies have been performed regarding self propulsion of biological organisms  These include studies of all different sizes and types of creatures in both air and water media  The present research focuses only on neutrally buoyant organisms in an incompressible fluid  Considering only this portion of this spectrum of bio mechanical self propulsion  there are three major groups of cases which can be studied  as discussed by Fauci and Peskin  1  Within the realm of large Reynolds numbers  several methods have been used in analyzing bio mechanical propulsion  One of the first of these was set forth by Lighthill  2  which is a  small displacement  model  Figure 1  Top view of a swimming fish  showing the coordinate system used  The origin is at the head of the fish and the y dimension is vertical  out of the page  The equation for total average power required for the fish to move with a displacement h x t  is developed by Lighthill is Likewise  the efficiency of the swimming body can be computed as the ratio of the amount of power available for propulsion to the total amount of power expended by the fish  Since the amount of power expended in propulsion is P   TU  the efficiency of swimming can be expressed as   Standing Wave Body Shape  In order to calculate the equilibrium velocity U  or efficiency of any swimming motion  an assumption about the shape and nature of movement of the fish must be assumed  Several shapes were investigated as part of this research  The first shape investigated was that of a standing wave  Figure 2 shows examples of the shape of the fish for various values of c  Figure 2  Three top views of the centerline of a swimming fish  each with a different value of c  the curvature coefficient  Figure 3 shows a plot of the equilibrium velocity of the fish as a function of curvature coefficient for various values of amplitude  B  The velocity tends toward zero for c   p and c   2p  but is a maximum at c   3p  2  This corresponds with a zero slope at the end of the tail  The larger amplitudes bring about larger equilibrium velocities  however amplitudes larger than those shown here would be difficult to consider as  small  The velocities shown are for a frequency of oscillation of w   1  Figure 4 shows the swimming efficiency for the same parameters used in Figure 3  As with velocity  the efficiency is a maximum at c   2p  3  corresponding to a zero slope on the tail at all times  It should be noted here that the amplitude of the movement of the body has no affect on efficiency since the amplitude cancels out of the numerator and denominator of the expression for efficiency  Figure 3  Steady state velocity of the fish  as a function of curvature coefficient  at various amplitudes of
