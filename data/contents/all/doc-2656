calculated using data collected from the U S  Census Bureau s American Community Survey  which samples a random population of U S  households each year  For VMI  self reported median earnings for alumni were  115 000  versus predicted earnings of  78 444  The study s authors note that colleges and universities with a strong emphasis on the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics are among the top performers in the value added category  although not all of those schools are STEM specific  The only other Virginia school to be ranked in the top 20 was neighboring Washington and Lee University  None of the U S  service academies were listed in the top 20  VMI also scored highly in three measures of educational quality used by Brookings  Out of a perfect score

colleges and universities ranked in the top 20 nationwide by the Brookings Institution in a recent report on the value added earnings of midcareer alumni  Researchers at Brookings  an independent think tank based in Washington  D C  calculated VMI s value added score at 38 percent  That score is based on the difference between actual earnings of alumni working full time with at least 10 years of work experience  as self reported to Payscale com  and those graduates  expected earnings based on demographic information and college major  Expected earnings are calculated using data collected from the U S  Census Bureau s American Community Survey  which samples a random population of U S  households each year  For VMI  self reported median earnings for alumni were  115 000  versus predicted earnings of  78 444  The study s authors note that colleges and universities with a strong emphasis on the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics are among the top performers in the value added category  although not all of those schools are STEM specific  The only other Virginia school to be ranked in the top 20 was neighboring Washington and Lee University  None of the U S  service academies were listed in the top 20  VMI also scored highly in three measures of educational quality used by Brookings  Out of a perfect score of 100  the Institute received a 99 for earnings value added  a 95 for occupational earnings power  and an 81 for loan repayment by graduates  Occupational earnings power is based on the kinds of occupations graduates of a particular school enter and the average pay for those occupations  Data for occupational earnings was derived from federal data and LinkedIn  a social networking site for business professionals  The loan repayment rate is calculated by taking the number of borrowers who default on their federal student loans within the first three years of the repayment period  A lower number of graduates defaulting translates into a higher loan repayment score for the school  Data on loan default rates came from the U S  Department of Education  The purpose of the Brookings report is to evaluate schools based on those schools  contributions to the economic success of their graduates  while controlling for factors such as the characteristics of the student at the time of admission and the institution s type and location  The full report can be accessed at http bit ly BrookingsVMI   VMI      VMI in Top 20 in Brookings Value Rankings In one of VMI s undergraduate research projects  Hardy Hendren  15 and
