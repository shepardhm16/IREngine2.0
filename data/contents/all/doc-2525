Panel Closes Reagan Legacy Conference LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2014    The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs During the Ronald Reagan Era  came to a close today with a panel session that gave insight into the motivations of the two world leaders whose ideals and efforts made possible a peaceful end to the Cold War  President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev  Beth Fischer  a lecturer at the University of Toronto  spoke about Reagan s desire to eradicate nuclear weapons  a vision that informed his foreign policies across the board and allowed him to establish a meaningful dialogue with Gorbachev   In his view  nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction were morally reprehensible  Fischer   He sought to fundamentally change the way we think about nuclear weapons and American security  This was a radical vision for the time  one that was opposed by Reagan s advisers  fellow conservatives  and allies across the world   There was only one leader in the whole world who also wanted to eliminate nuclear weapons  and that happened to be Mikhail Gorbachev  said Fischer   On this one issue  eradicating nuclear weapons  they saw eye to eye    This was the foundation for the peaceful resolution of the Cold War  Fischer dismissed what she calls the myth of triumphalism  the idea that the American military buildup and demonstrations of resolve led to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union  Rather  Fischer sees the peaceful resolution of the Cold War as a result of successful diplomacy   Remarkably  the president was able to put aside his own convictions about communism at the height of the Cold War to pursue a more secure  more humane world  said Fischer   President Reagan hated communism  but he hated nuclear weapons even more  Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University Archie Brown provided a portrait of Gorbachev within the Soviet political system   Behind the monolithic facade that the communist party of the Soviet Union presented to its own people and to the outside world  there was a wide variety of views  said Brown  Under Gorbachev  the articulation of diverse views within the regime was encouraged  allowing for an open exchange of ideas  Likewise  perestroika and glasnost reforms rapidly changed the political and social terrain of the USSR   Before Gorbachev s reforms  if you were caught with a copy of George Orwell s 1984 or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn s Gulag Archipelago  you could expect a trip to the gulag yourself  said Brown  noting that by 1988 huge editions of such books were printed in Moscow  These domestic reforms had powerful reverberations in Soviet foreign policy   As the Soviet system became freer by the month  this vastly improved the atmosphere in which meetings with western leaders took place  said Brown   In foreign policy  the most fundamental change that Gorbachev made was encapsulated in his declaration   The people of every county have a right to decide for themselves what kind of political and economic system they wish to live in  This re evaluation of foreign and domestic policies removed the ideological foundation for the Cold War  allowing it to come to a peaceful close   The fact that Reagan and Gorbachev were thinking about ending the Cold War was huge  It was radical  said Fischer   Most people thought if the Cold War was ever to end  it would end in nuclear Armageddon  No one imagined that it would end peacefully  Looking back to the challenges of the Cold War is vital to the mission of the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis  which  with the Center for Leadership and Ethics  sponsored the conference   The Reagan period is so important  said Lt  Col  Brad Coleman  95  associate professor of history  noting that the center s focus is on  how the Cold War shapes the challenges and opportunities we face today  The Reagan conference was the first major conference on the VMI post sponsored by the Adams Center  On the horizon for the Adams Center are an applied history conference and a George C  Marshall conference  both looking to glean insight from history relevant to current affairs and bring cadets together with scholars  national security professionals  and fellow students   Ultimately  my vision for the Adams Center is that it becomes a platform for collaboration  not

Photo by Kevin Remington  Final Panel Closes Reagan Legacy Conference LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2014    The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs During the Ronald Reagan Era  came to a close today with a panel session that gave insight into the motivations of the two world leaders whose ideals and efforts made possible a peaceful end to the Cold War  President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev  Beth Fischer  a lecturer at the University of Toronto  spoke about Reagan s desire to eradicate nuclear weapons  a vision that informed his foreign policies across the board and allowed him to establish a meaningful dialogue with Gorbachev   In his view  nuclear weapons and mutually assured destruction were morally reprehensible  Fischer   He sought to fundamentally change the way we think about nuclear weapons and American security  This was a radical vision for the time  one that was opposed by Reagan s advisers  fellow conservatives  and allies across the world   There was only one leader in the whole world who also wanted to eliminate nuclear weapons  and that happened to be Mikhail Gorbachev  said Fischer   On this one issue  eradicating nuclear weapons  they saw eye to eye    This was the foundation for the peaceful resolution of the Cold War  Fischer dismissed what she calls the myth of triumphalism  the idea that the American military buildup and demonstrations of resolve led to the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union  Rather  Fischer sees the peaceful resolution of the Cold War as a result of successful diplomacy   Remarkably  the president was able to put aside his own convictions about communism at the height of the Cold War to pursue a more secure  more humane world  said Fischer   President Reagan hated communism  but he hated nuclear weapons even more  Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University Archie Brown provided a portrait of Gorbachev within the Soviet political system   Behind the monolithic facade that the communist party of the Soviet Union presented to its own people and to the outside world  there was a wide variety of views  said Brown  Under Gorbachev  the articulation of diverse views within the regime was encouraged  allowing for an open exchange of ideas  Likewise  perestroika and glasnost reforms rapidly changed the political and social terrain of the USSR   Before Gorbachev s reforms  if you were caught with a copy of George Orwell s 1984 or Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn s Gulag Archipelago  you could expect a trip to the gulag yourself  said Brown  noting that by 1988 huge editions of such books were printed in Moscow  These domestic reforms had powerful reverberations in Soviet foreign policy   As the Soviet system became freer by the month  this vastly improved the atmosphere in which meetings with western leaders took place  said Brown   In foreign policy  the most fundamental change that Gorbachev made was encapsulated in his declaration   The people of every county have a right to decide for themselves what kind of political and economic system they wish to live in  This re evaluation of foreign and domestic policies removed the ideological foundation for the Cold War  allowing it to come to a peaceful close   The fact that Reagan and Gorbachev were thinking about ending the Cold War was huge  It was radical  said Fischer   Most people thought if the Cold War was ever to end  it would end in nuclear Armageddon  No one imagined that it would end peacefully  Looking back to the challenges of the Cold War is vital to the mission of the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis  which  with the Center for Leadership and Ethics  sponsored the conference   The Reagan period is so important  said Lt  Col  Brad Coleman  95  associate professor of history  noting that the center s focus is on  how the Cold War shapes the challenges and opportunities we face today  The Reagan conference was the first major conference on the VMI post sponsored by the Adams Center  On the horizon for the Adams Center are an applied history conference and a George C  Marshall conference  both looking to glean insight from history relevant to current affairs and bring cadets together with scholars  national security professionals  and fellow students   Ultimately  my vision for the Adams Center is that it becomes a platform for collaboration  not only across disciplines and departments here at VMI but also across the community more broadly  said Coleman   John Robertson IV  VMI Communications
