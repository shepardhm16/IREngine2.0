Patrick Lenehan Advisor  Jessica Libertini This primary goal of this project was to help assess and make recommendations for improving the judging of a SIAM sponsored high school mathematical modeling competition  the Moody s Mega Math Challenge  also called M3  The M3 challenge uses hundreds of volunteer judges  mostly faculty from across the country  to assist in a triage round of judging  aiming at identifying which papers should advance into the final rounds of judging  Due to the disparity of judging scores  as individual judges bring their own biases  a calibration system is currently in place  Over the years  various calibration algorithms have been applied  but their effectiveness has been unmeasured  In this project we examined the effects of past  current  and proposed calibration systems  as well as calibration systems used by similar competitions  After analyzing these systems  the students made recommendations for improving the systems  as well as recommendations for future research  Predicting NCAA Basketball and NCAA Football through the Use of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Predicting NCAA Basketball and NCAA Football through the Use of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Cadet  Connor Loken Advisor  John David This work looked at predicting all NCAA football and basketball games between 2012 and 2014 using a novel approach  The inputs for the prediction were the Las Vegas line along with the amount of web traffic for each team  We then used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inferential system to predict the outcome of the game  This approach combines a neural network approach with a fuzzy logic membership function approach which proved to be extremely accurate in predicting the winners of all games  Pirate Detection Pirate Detection Pirate DetectionSponsor  Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics LabCadet Researchers  Stephen Mascioli  Cameron Armstrong  Ryan HarnerFaculty Advisor  John David This project was initiated to better understand the capabilities of naval sea and air assets off the Horn of Africa to be used as a tool against piracy in that region  A model was developed to simulate possible plane routes and pirate detection probabilities based off of realistic operating conditions in order to determine the maximum possible area coverage in a particular region over 7 days  Major factors in the model were the density of merchant ships in the region and the availability of patrolling assets  Meal Delivery Sponsor  Valley Program for Aging Services  VPAS  Cadet Researcher  Alex Falcetti High School Interns  Stevan Hall Mejia Advisors  Nate Axvig and John David One of the services VPAS provides is a program in which hot meals are delivered to homebound senior citizens for their noon meal  Currently  over 400 meals are served each day  Our task was to find a more efficient way to route delivery drivers given the daily fluctuations in both volunteer aid as well as meal demand  To accomplish this  we designed an easy to use piece of software that employs a combination of genetic algorithms  allowing VPAS to deliver their meals in a more efficient manner  Energy Usage in the City of Lexington Sponsor  City of Lexington Cadet Researcher  Robert  Chap  Michie High School Interns  Kunal Ghandi and Stevan Hall Mejia Faculty Mentor  Geoffrey Cox The City of Lexington is located in Rockbridge County  Virginia  The city owns and operates 27 buildings with 42 separate energy accounts  13 natural gas and 29 electric  Prior to our project  all records of these accounts were handwritten documents kept within city hall  penciled in by a city employee  The goals of the project were to first take this information and put it in a digital state and then provide a tool to analyze the data in question  Our tool allows the city to quickly access visual models of each building s energy consumption so that improvements can be made and inefficiencies addressed  By looking at the visual models  the city can increase its overall sustainability  providing economic  environmental  and social benefits to the community  Data Mining in Major League Baseball Sponsor  VMI Summer Undergraduate Research Initiative Cadet Researcher  Will Lucas Faculty Mentor  John David Data Mining has become an increasingly popular technique in science  economics  business and sports  especially a sport with as rich data as baseball  In this project we mined millions of baseball statistics to predict which teams will win on a day to day basis as well as over entire seasons  We focused on statistical techniques of regression  artificial neural networks and decision trees  Real Interest Rate Prediction using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques Real Interest Rate Predictionusing Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques Sponsor  National Science Foundation Researcher  Robert Michie Advisor  Atin Basuchoudhary and John David This project examines factors of political risk and theirability to influence and predict real interest rates  Various data miningtechniques were used on the ICRG researcher dataset for political risk  whichis made up of 12 weighted components   The dataset contains data from the years1984 to 2008 for 37 countries  Unsupervised learning techniques were used inorder to find hidden structures within the data itself  while supervisedlearning techniques were used to make future predictions of the real interestrate     The key points of this work arethat money growth is not a good predictor of real interest rates  as well asthe fact that a committee of artificial neural networks proved to best thestrongest model in terms of predictive performance  and finally that there arecertain political risk factors that are indicative of changes in real interestrates  NBA Data Mining and Predictive Modeling Sponsor  VMI Cadet Researcher  James T  Snyder Advisor  John A  David Virginia Military Institute June 20  2013  In this project we explore the importance of data in the process of making predictions of outcomes of National Basketball Association  NBA  games   We use NBA statistics for the 2004 2005 season up to and including the 2010 2011 season  We utilize unsupervised learning techniques to gain an informed understanding of our data and how it operates  These techniques include Clustering  Principal Component Analysis  and Factor Analysis  We learn predictive capabilities and the different ways in which the statistics impact the outcome of an NBA game  We also use supervised learning techniques to build models in order to make predictions on the score differential between two teams in a given game   Committees of Artificial Neural Networks  ANN s  and Forests of Decision Trees are built based on data leading up to seasons we wish to predict  In this study the most accurate models are built using data from all seasons  2004 2009  and then evaluated using 2010 data to make predictions  Our most accurate model predicted 2010 2011 NBA game winners with an average accuracy of 72 45  and a mean error of 8 32 points  Reduction of Shipping Errors Using Data Mining and Data Analysis Cadet Researchers  William Lucas and Steven Geyer Advisor  Nate Axvig Different data mining techniques were used to assess the data that we received from the client  The two main techniques used to analyze the data were artificial neural networks and multiple regression analysis  The goal of the project was to be able to predict errors on a given order  The two techniques yielded comparable results but due to the complexity of the neural networks we decided to use the multiple regression model to present to our client because it is much simpler to for them to use  Data Management for the United Way

specific to greater Augusta County  as well as the Virginia comparisons  with emphasis on making it easily updatable for United Way employees and quickly navigable for any member of the community interested in browsing local data  Another goal of this project is to pinpoint not only the main problems in the community  but connecting the factors that are causing them  In that way  support will be used to resolve the cause of the problem  not a symptom of it  The database  which included data analysis such as multiple linear regressions and statistical hypothesis tests  could identify what the symptoms are and begin to link some of the factors in order to discover the causes  Process Reengineering and Optimization for Vector Industries Sponsor  Vector Industries Cadet Researchers

Mathematics  SIAM  Cadets  Austin States  Patrick Lenehan Advisor  Jessica Libertini This primary goal of this project was to help assess and make recommendations for improving the judging of a SIAM sponsored high school mathematical modeling competition  the Moody s Mega Math Challenge  also called M3  The M3 challenge uses hundreds of volunteer judges  mostly faculty from across the country  to assist in a triage round of judging  aiming at identifying which papers should advance into the final rounds of judging  Due to the disparity of judging scores  as individual judges bring their own biases  a calibration system is currently in place  Over the years  various calibration algorithms have been applied  but their effectiveness has been unmeasured  In this project we examined the effects of past  current  and proposed calibration systems  as well as calibration systems used by similar competitions  After analyzing these systems  the students made recommendations for improving

NCAA Football through the Use of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Cadet  Connor Loken Advisor  John David This work looked at predicting all NCAA football and basketball games between 2012 and 2014 using a novel approach  The inputs for the prediction were the Las Vegas line along with the amount of web traffic for each team  We then used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inferential system to predict the outcome of the game  This approach combines a neural network approach with a fuzzy logic membership function approach which proved to be extremely accurate in predicting the winners of all games  Pirate Detection Pirate Detection Pirate DetectionSponsor  Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics LabCadet Researchers  Stephen Mascioli  Cameron Armstrong  Ryan HarnerFaculty Advisor  John David This project was initiated to better understand the capabilities of naval sea and air assets off the Horn of Africa to be used as a tool against piracy in that region  A model was developed to simulate possible plane routes and pirate detection probabilities based off of realistic operating conditions in order to determine the maximum possible area coverage in a particular region over 7 days  Major factors in the model were the density of merchant ships in the region and the availability of patrolling assets  Meal Delivery Sponsor  Valley Program for Aging Services  VPAS  Cadet Researcher  Alex Falcetti High School Interns  Stevan Hall Mejia Advisors  Nate Axvig and John David One of the services VPAS provides is a program in which hot meals are delivered to homebound senior citizens for their noon meal  Currently  over 400 meals are served each day  Our task was to find a more efficient way to route delivery drivers given the daily fluctuations in both volunteer aid as well as meal demand  To accomplish this  we designed an easy to use piece of software that employs a combination of genetic algorithms  allowing VPAS to deliver their meals in a more efficient manner  Energy Usage in the City of Lexington Sponsor  City of Lexington Cadet Researcher  Robert  Chap  Michie High School Interns  Kunal Ghandi and Stevan Hall Mejia Faculty Mentor  Geoffrey Cox The City of Lexington is located in Rockbridge County  Virginia  The city owns and operates 27 buildings with 42 separate energy accounts  13 natural gas and 29 electric  Prior to our project  all records of these accounts were handwritten documents kept within city hall  penciled in by a city employee  The goals of the project were to first take this information and put it in a digital state and then provide a tool to analyze the data in question  Our tool allows the city to quickly access visual models of each building s energy consumption so that improvements can be made and inefficiencies addressed  By looking at the visual models  the city can increase its overall sustainability  providing economic  environmental  and social benefits to the community  Data Mining in Major League Baseball Sponsor  VMI Summer Undergraduate Research Initiative Cadet Researcher  Will Lucas Faculty Mentor  John David Data Mining has become an increasingly popular technique in science  economics  business and sports  especially a sport with as rich data as baseball  In this project we mined millions of baseball statistics to predict which teams will win on a day to day basis as well as over

Real Interest Rate Predictionusing Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques Sponsor  National Science Foundation Researcher  Robert Michie Advisor  Atin Basuchoudhary and John David This project examines factors of political risk and theirability to influence and predict real interest rates  Various data miningtechniques were used on the ICRG researcher dataset for political risk  whichis made up of 12 weighted components   The dataset contains data from the years1984 to 2008 for 37 countries  Unsupervised learning techniques were used inorder to find hidden structures within the data itself  while supervisedlearning techniques were used to make future predictions of the real interestrate     The key points of this work arethat money growth is not a good predictor of real interest rates  as well asthe fact that a committee of artificial neural networks proved to best thestrongest model in terms of predictive performance  and finally that there arecertain political risk factors that are indicative of changes in real interestrates  NBA Data Mining and Predictive Modeling Sponsor  VMI Cadet Researcher  James T  Snyder Advisor  John A  David Virginia Military Institute June 20  2013  In this project we explore the importance of data in the process of making predictions of outcomes of National Basketball Association  NBA  games   We use NBA statistics for the 2004 2005 season up to and including the 2010 2011 season  We utilize unsupervised learning techniques to gain an informed understanding of our data and how it operates  These techniques include Clustering  Principal Component Analysis  and Factor Analysis  We learn predictive capabilities and the different ways in which the statistics impact the outcome of an NBA game  We also use supervised learning techniques to build models in order to make predictions on the score differential between two teams in a given game   Committees of Artificial Neural Networks  ANN s  and Forests of Decision Trees are built based on data leading up to seasons we wish to predict  In this study the most accurate models are built using data from all seasons  2004 2009  and then evaluated using 2010 data to make predictions  Our most accurate model predicted 2010 2011 NBA game winners with an average accuracy of 72 45  and a mean error of 8 32 points  Reduction of Shipping Errors Using Data Mining and Data Analysis Cadet Researchers  William Lucas and Steven Geyer Advisor  Nate Axvig Different data mining techniques were used to assess the data that we received from the client  The two main techniques used to analyze the data were artificial neural networks and multiple regression analysis  The goal of the project was to be able to predict errors on a given order  The two techniques yielded comparable results but due to the complexity of the neural networks we decided to use the multiple regression model to present to our client because it is much simpler to for them to use  Data

company in Lynchburg  VA  They ship equipment to all 50 states in the US through UPS by ground  The problem that they presented us with is that they have spent about  60 000 in shipping alone last year and that shipping something to California from Lynchburg and back takes 13 days  They want us to find out if it is profitable to open a second distribution center  and find out exactly where that should be  the end goal being to reduce shipping costs  and to increase availability of merchandise  M3 Judging Improvement M3 Judging Improvement Sponsor  Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics  SIAM  Cadets  Austin States  Patrick Lenehan Advisor  Jessica Libertini This primary goal of this project was to help assess and make recommendations for improving the judging of a SIAM sponsored high school mathematical modeling competition  the Moody s Mega Math Challenge  also called M3  The M3 challenge uses hundreds of volunteer judges  mostly faculty from across the country  to assist in a triage round of judging  aiming at identifying which papers should advance into the final rounds of judging  Due to the disparity of judging scores  as individual judges bring their own biases  a calibration system is currently in place  Over the years  various calibration algorithms have been applied  but their effectiveness has been unmeasured  In this project we examined the effects of past  current  and proposed calibration systems  as well as calibration systems used by similar competitions  After analyzing these systems  the students made recommendations for improving the systems  as well as recommendations for future research  Predicting NCAA Basketball and NCAA Football through the Use of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Predicting NCAA Basketball and NCAA Football through the Use of an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Cadet  Connor Loken Advisor  John David This work looked at predicting all NCAA football and basketball games between 2012 and 2014 using a novel approach  The inputs for the prediction were the Las Vegas line along with the amount of web traffic for each team  We then used an adaptive neuro fuzzy inferential system to predict the outcome of the game  This approach combines a neural network approach with a fuzzy logic membership function approach which proved to be extremely accurate in predicting the winners of all games  Pirate Detection Pirate Detection Pirate DetectionSponsor  Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics LabCadet Researchers  Stephen Mascioli  Cameron Armstrong  Ryan HarnerFaculty Advisor  John David This project was initiated to better understand the capabilities of naval sea and air assets off the Horn of Africa to be used as a tool against piracy in that region  A model was developed to simulate possible plane routes and pirate detection probabilities based off of realistic operating conditions in order to determine the maximum possible area coverage in a particular region over 7 days  Major factors in the model were the density of merchant ships in the region and the availability of patrolling assets  Meal Delivery Sponsor  Valley Program for Aging Services  VPAS  Cadet Researcher  Alex Falcetti High School Interns  Stevan Hall Mejia Advisors  Nate Axvig and John David One of the services VPAS provides is a program in which hot meals are delivered to homebound senior citizens for their noon meal  Currently  over 400 meals are served each day  Our task was to find a more efficient way to route delivery drivers given the daily fluctuations in both volunteer aid as well as meal demand  To accomplish this  we designed an easy to use piece of software that employs a combination of genetic algorithms  allowing VPAS to deliver their meals in a more efficient manner  Energy Usage in the City of Lexington Sponsor  City of Lexington Cadet Researcher  Robert  Chap  Michie High School Interns  Kunal Ghandi and Stevan Hall Mejia Faculty Mentor  Geoffrey Cox The City of Lexington is located in Rockbridge County  Virginia  The city owns and operates 27 buildings with 42 separate energy accounts  13 natural gas and 29 electric  Prior to our project  all records of these accounts were handwritten documents kept within city hall  penciled in by a city employee  The goals of the project were to first take this information and put it in a digital state and then provide a tool to analyze the data in question  Our tool allows the city to quickly access visual models of each building s energy consumption so that improvements can be made and inefficiencies addressed  By looking at the visual models  the city can increase its overall sustainability  providing economic  environmental  and social benefits to the community  Data Mining in Major League Baseball Sponsor  VMI Summer Undergraduate Research Initiative Cadet Researcher  Will Lucas Faculty Mentor  John David Data Mining has become an increasingly popular technique in science  economics  business and sports  especially a sport with as rich data as baseball  In this project we mined millions of baseball statistics to predict which teams will win on a day to day basis as well as over entire seasons  We focused on statistical techniques of regression  artificial neural networks and decision trees  Real Interest Rate Prediction using Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques Real Interest Rate Predictionusing Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Techniques Sponsor  National Science Foundation Researcher  Robert Michie Advisor  Atin Basuchoudhary and John David This project examines factors of political risk and theirability to influence and predict real interest rates  Various data miningtechniques were used on the ICRG researcher dataset for political risk  whichis made up of 12 weighted components   The dataset contains data from the years1984 to 2008 for 37 countries  Unsupervised learning techniques were used inorder to find hidden structures within the data itself  while supervisedlearning techniques were used to make future predictions of the real interestrate     The key points of this work arethat money growth is not a good predictor of real interest rates  as well asthe fact that a committee of artificial neural networks proved to best thestrongest model in terms of predictive performance  and finally that there arecertain political risk factors that are indicative of changes in real interestrates  NBA Data Mining and Predictive Modeling Sponsor  VMI Cadet Researcher  James T  Snyder Advisor  John A  David Virginia Military Institute June 20  2013  In this project we explore the importance of data in the process of making predictions of outcomes of National Basketball Association  NBA  games   We use NBA statistics for the 2004 2005 season up to and including the 2010 2011 season  We utilize unsupervised learning techniques to gain an informed understanding of our data and how it operates  These techniques include Clustering  Principal Component Analysis  and Factor Analysis  We learn predictive capabilities and the different ways in which the statistics impact the outcome of an NBA game  We also use supervised learning techniques to build models in order to make predictions on the score differential between two teams in a given game   Committees of Artificial Neural Networks  ANN s  and Forests of Decision Trees are built based on data leading up to seasons we wish to predict  In this study the most accurate models are built using data from all seasons  2004 2009  and then evaluated using 2010 data to make predictions  Our most accurate model predicted 2010 2011 NBA game winners with an average accuracy of 72 45  and a mean error of 8 32 points  Reduction of Shipping Errors Using Data Mining and Data Analysis Cadet Researchers  William Lucas and Steven Geyer Advisor  Nate Axvig Different data mining techniques were used to assess the data that we received from the client  The two main techniques used to analyze the data were artificial neural networks and multiple regression analysis  The goal of the project was to be able to predict errors on a given order  The two techniques yielded comparable results but due to the complexity of the neural networks we decided to use the multiple regression model to present to our client because it is much simpler to for them to use  Data Management for the United Way of Greater Augusta Sponsor  United Way of Greater Augusta Cadet Researcher  John Zippel Advisor  Meagan Herald The United Way of Greater Augusta strove to build a database containing facts and figures specific to greater Augusta County  as well as the Virginia comparisons  with emphasis on making it easily updatable for United Way employees and quickly navigable for any member of the community interested in browsing local data  Another goal of this project is to pinpoint not only the main problems in the community  but connecting the factors that are causing them  In that way  support will be used to resolve the cause of the problem  not a symptom of it  The database  which included data analysis such as multiple linear regressions and statistical hypothesis tests  could identify what the symptoms are and begin to link some of the factors in order to discover the causes  Process Reengineering and Optimization for Vector Industries Sponsor  Vector Industries Cadet Researchers  Alexander Lin Advisor  Geoffrey Cox Vector Industries is a non profit employment oriented organization that works to provide individuals with disabilities financial and social independence  Their services include providing complex product assembly  packaging  product testing  and much more  Recently  Vector has decided to make efforts in transforming specific business operations and processes to ultimately improve their organization s performance  These processes involve the analysis of large amounts of financial data  employee wages  and transportation routes for picking up employees  To assist in their efforts  a MATLAB transportation routing program was utilized for reducing transportation expenses  Additionally  Microsoft Excel automation tools were developed that conserves time  decreases human error  and generates organized data sets  Modeling Food Prices and Minimizing Food Cost for Young Life Sponsor  VMI and Young Life Advisor  John David This project was initiated to better the food buying practices of the Young Life Organization as well as to develop tools for them to utilize in this process  One tool analyzed past food invoices to determine when certain products will historically be the cheapest  In addition tools were developed to help Young Life build a larger database allowing for their model to become better overtime and to normalize the price lists  Valuation of Selected Asset Classes Using Artificial Neural Networks Cadet  Jack Zippel Faculty Advisor  Maj  John David Sponsor  Davidson   Garrard  Inc  David Hansen The goal of this project was to value a set of exchange traded funds  ETFs  that Davidson   Garrard may use as indicators of market potential  Predicting the prices of the ETFs allows for an effective valuation technique  if the price will increase  the ETF is currently undervalued and vice versa  Predictions spanning two years provide optimal results given that short term market oscillations distort greater trends and larger economic events drastically change long term market direction  Data Analysis for American Shakespeare Center Cadet  Ryan Poffenbarger Faculty

Nate Axvig Different data mining techniques were used to assess the data that we received from the client  The two main techniques used to analyze the data were artificial neural networks and multiple regression analysis  The goal of the project was to be able to predict errors on a given order  The two techniques yielded comparable results but due to the complexity of the neural networks we

Greater Augusta Cadet Researcher  John Zippel Advisor  Meagan Herald The United Way of Greater Augusta strove to build a database containing facts and figures specific to greater Augusta County  as well as the Virginia comparisons  with emphasis on making it easily updatable for United Way employees and quickly navigable for any member of the community interested in browsing local data  Another goal of this project is to pinpoint not only the main problems in the community  but connecting the factors that are causing them  In that way  support will be used to resolve the cause of the problem  not a symptom of it  The database  which included data analysis such as multiple linear regressions and statistical hypothesis tests  could identify what the symptoms are and begin to link some of the factors in order to discover the causes Data Management for the United Way of Greater Augusta Sponsor  United Way of Greater Augusta Cadet Researcher  John Zippel Advisor  Meagan Herald The United
