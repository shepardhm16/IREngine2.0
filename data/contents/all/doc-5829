24450 SURI Project Explores Avenue for Recycling Plastic Institute Report  August 2012  When Cadet John McDonald  15 talks about his SURI project to evaluate how well concrete made partially from plastic performs according to engineering standards  two thoughts emerge  This project was a whole lot of work  with many opportunities for him to develop his problem solving skills  engineering and otherwise  And the project just might spawn a whole bunch more research  The process was pretty straightforward  Collect and sort samples of each type of plastic from waste produced on post  shred it and replace some of the sand in the concrete mixture with the shredded plastic  mold the resulting concrete into cubes and test them for compressive strength  Each step presented a separate challenge  Maj  Jenny deHart  VMI physical plant sustainability coordinator and one of McDonald s SURI mentors  helped him refine his goal in using plastic and then offered him access to VMI s waste stream so he could get enough of each of the seven types  Crozet Hall staff helped McDonald figure out how to complete the sometimes unappetizing task of washing food residues off the plastics without using too much energy or water  Another challenge  to turn yogurt cups and Styrofoam packing materials and laundry detergent bottles into consistently shredded plastic  required more ingenuity   I sorted it by type  cut it with tin snips  and put it into an oven  said McDonald  who continued adding pieces till the plastic filled the cans he was using as molds   It made a solid plastic cylinder that I could use on a cheese grater  McDonald spent an entire weekend hand grating plastic on a cheese grater before he decided to borrow an idea from industry  where cheese graters spin   I put a bolt through the center of the chunk of plastic  put the bolt into a drill and ran it over a cheese grater attached to a vice  said McDonald   I didn t have a way to make the cheese grater spin safely so I made the cylinder spin instead  Though McDonald was hoping the plastic might perform similarly to sand in concrete  he quickly discovered that measuring the volume of shredded plastic was more difficult than measuring the volume of sand   The plastics floated and all the tests for concrete design are done for things that sink  explained Lt  Col  Chuck Newhouse  associate professor of civil engineering and McDonald s other SURI mentor  When his first thought  a French press  didn t work  McDonald created a suitable device using an Erlenmeyer flask  He replace 25 percent of the volume of the sand in the concrete mixture with plastic and tested the resulting cubes for compressive strenth after 24 hours  three days and 28 days   The end product has been very useful  said Newhouse  who anticipates that the project will eventually produce an article in a peer reviewed journal   We learned several new things that we could not have anticipated before the project started   On average  the plastic met 55 percent of the standard cube s strength  said McDonald  Some did much better  Best of all was expanded polystyrene  or Styrofoam  No  6 plastic  which came in at 68 percent  which is pretty strong  he said   That can take roughly 3 500 pounds per square inch  Not every use of concrete needs large compressive strength  A bridge deck needs to be a lot stronger than a pedestrian sidewalk  said McDonald  Other uses for such concrete range from landscaping pavers to base courses for roads to structures built with insulated poured concrete  With the method for figuring densities sorted out  future projects could address specific issues  Newhouse noted  for instance that the concrete mixtures were unexpectedly dry  Another project might increase water content  which Newhouse suspects will increase the compressive strength of the concrete  McDonald  who would like to pursue this research for his honors thesis  noted how the project benefited him   It was a lot of work  but its been really rewarding  said McDonald   This is the first time I ve written a technical research paper    Col  Newhouse and Maj  deHart gave me the opportunity to steer the project    and they were there to support me  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination Statement   Privacy
