media data    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  Cadet Project Traces Role of Social Media in Evolution of  Occupy  Protests LEXINGTON  Va  July 23  2015   According to a March survey by Business Insider  71 percent of all American Internet users interact on Facebook at least once a month  Add in other forms of online communication  like Instagram or Twitter  and the number of users of social media skyrockets  Obviously  social media can be a powerful tool  Cadet Matt Armentrout  16 has tried to find out just how much influence applications like Facebook and Twitter can have with his Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project in VMI s Department of International Studies and Political Science   I don t think  people  understand the strength and the power of these online communities  Armentrout said   It is something that is only going to get bigger  To illustrate his point  Armentrout focused on the  Occupy  movements  which sprang from the Occupy Wallstreet phenomenon of 2011  He said he has discovered that over the last four years there have been more than 1 200 protests waving the Occupy banner in more than 100 countries  That includes Hong Kong  the other major protest he studied  where  in 2014  thousands of activists gathered to demand voting rights  While protests certainly are not new  the way these protests developed is   The traditional theories will always tell you different resources you need to get people organized  and usually that means there was already a core group of activists there  said Dr  Vera Heuer  assistant professor of international studies and Armentrout s adviser on this summer project   What Matt has found out with Occupy  is that  it wasn t a group of activists that said we are going to use the Internet to distribute and diffuse our information  It was a group that formed online  As he studied Twitter posts  or  tweets  for both the Occupy Wallstreet and the Occupy Central movements  Armentrout discovered just such a phenomenon  Instead of a group using social media to get its idea to the masses  the idea itself attracted thousands  if not millions  to it  and the movement was born   The idea existed first  The whole movement  in a sense  derived from a Canadian blog  one dude  said Armentrout   There can be an idea first  and people flock to it    It seemed that more than social media becoming a tool  to relate ideas  within  social media  they were almost able to form a social movement without even trying  Armentrout s research is  it seems  among the first to explore this aspect of social media  For Heuer  that is one of the things that makes this summer s work so exciting   It s like a social scientific exercise that Matt is engaging in  she said   There are all of these possibilities of what the Internet can do  People should know about these aspects of  social media  what it does to democracy  what it does to political participation  This SURI project  one of three in the international studies department this summer  grew from a research question Armentrout chose when he was a member of Heuer s Riots  Protests  and Social Movements class last fall  One assignment asked the students to choose a protest or movement and study it throughout the semester   I started working on this project in the fall  and I thought it was cool  said Armentrout   There have been some frustrations and setbacks  of course  but it has been a really fun project so far  Armentrout has completed his research  but it does not end there  He will submit his finished paper later this week and will present his findings at a conference or at a VMI undergraduate research symposium during the coming academic year    Chris Floyd  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni

According to a March survey by Business Insider  71 percent of all American Internet users interact on Facebook at least once a month  Add in other forms of online communication  like Instagram or Twitter  and the number of users of social media skyrockets  Obviously  social media can be a powerful tool  Cadet Matt Armentrout  16 has tried to find out just how much influence applications like Facebook and Twitter can have with his Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project in VMI s Department of International Studies and Political Science   I don t think  people  understand the strength and the power of these online communities  Armentrout said   It is something that is only going to get bigger  To illustrate his point  Armentrout focused on the  Occupy  movements  which sprang from the Occupy Wallstreet phenomenon of 2011  He said he has discovered that over the last four years there have been more than 1 200 protests waving the Occupy banner in more than 100 countries  That includes Hong Kong  the other major protest he studied  where  in 2014  thousands of activists gathered to demand voting rights  While protests certainly are not new  the way these protests developed is   The traditional theories will always tell you different resources you need to get people organized  and usually that means there was already a core group of activists there  said Dr  Vera Heuer  assistant professor of international studies and Armentrout s adviser on this summer project   What Matt has found out with Occupy  is that  it wasn t a group of activists that said we are going to use the Internet to distribute and diffuse our information  It was a group that formed online  As he studied Twitter posts  or  tweets  for both the Occupy Wallstreet and the Occupy Central movements  Armentrout discovered just such a phenomenon  Instead of a group using social media to get its idea to the masses  the idea itself attracted thousands  if not millions  to it  and the movement was born   The idea existed first  The whole movement  in a sense  derived from a Canadian blog  one dude  said Armentrout   There can be an idea first  and people flock to it    It seemed that more than social media becoming a tool  to relate ideas  within  social media  they were almost able to form a social movement without even trying  Armentrout s research is  it seems  among the first to explore this aspect of social media  For Heuer  that is one of the things that makes this summer s work so exciting   It s like a social scientific exercise that Matt is engaging in  she said   There are all of these possibilities of what the Internet can do  People should know about these aspects of  social media  what it does to democracy  what it does to political participation  This SURI project  one of three in the international studies department this summer  grew from a research question Armentrout chose when he was a member of Heuer s Riots  Protests  and Social Movements class last fall  One assignment asked the students to choose a protest or movement and study it throughout the semester   I started working on this project in the fall  and I thought it was cool  said Armentrout   There have been some frustrations and setbacks  of course  but it has been a really fun project so far  Armentrout has completed his research  but it does not end there  He will submit his finished paper later this week and will present his findings at a conference or at a VMI undergraduate research symposium during the coming academic year    Chris Floyd  VMI
