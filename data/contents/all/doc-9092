Research Home Teaching Student Pages IC Data Advising The image above shows an expanding endovascular stent on a catheter  Stents are inserted inside partially blocked coronary arteries and are expanded  where they remain as permanent scaffolds  One area of my research is in the fusion of electrical  computer  and mechanical engineering to build smart catheters with embedded instrumentation that allow these devices to be implanted with more precision and result in fewer patient complications  I maintain an active interest in digital signal processing  seismic communication  handheld instrumentation  entrepreneurship  endvascular stenting  and mechatronics especially as applied to robotic solutions for pest control  I have experience consulting in the fields of electronic instrumentation and robotics  and I have experience in patent and civil litigation involving both endovascular stents and electronic instrumentation  Primary Works Publications Gaff H  White A  Leas K
