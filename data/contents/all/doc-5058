Gen  J H  Binford Peay  III 25 April 2014 Members of the Class of 1964  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved those high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute and I feel very privileged to share it with you  Your reunion also falls in the year of the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute and the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  A new feature film entitled  Field of Lost Shoes  was premiered in Richmond on the 13th of this month  The movie was filmed in Virginia last year and tells the story of seven VMI cadets who fought in the battle  It is currently being shown at independent film festivals with hope of national traction and distribution  Your award today further celebrates that event  and your class  On Founders Day  11 November  we will celebrate the establishment of VMI in 1839 and its contributions to the state and the nation  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s  was a significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  science  and in society were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  Large computers were around  even at VMI  but slide rules and hand calculators still dominated  The thought of personal computers  much less cell phones  smart phones  GPS  night vision goggles and all the other technological marvels we now enjoy were the stuff of science fiction  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of that year  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your second class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  Conflict over the Cuban Missile Crisis was avoided when Russia agreed to halt construction  dismantle  and remove its rockets  and a long but difficult winding down of the Cold War began  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your first class year  Two days after the assassination  the evening gun was fired every half hour from Reveille to Retreat in honor of the slain president  September 7  1960  the day 330 of you matriculated  marked the beginning of VMI s 121st year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  From listening to cadets for five days instruct you to  right face  left face  things changed to hearing  Whoa  Rat   What s for dinner  mister   You re Sent Up  And you discovered that TAC officers could be creative in their  bones  which resulted in walking PTs and confinement  In fact  the archives of your classmates reveal that some of the  bones  from your years were memorable  For example   hayroll rolled counter clockwise   improperly rolled toothpaste tube   excess miscellaneous items in miscellaneous box   unshined light switch  and  allowing two young ladies dressed in cadet uniforms to march to the Mess Hall  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie  Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  In the 1964 BOMB  your historian wrote   Many of us felt that  Mardi Gras  had not developed the true picture  He continued   Not only did we have to learn to walk and think differently  but we had to develop a completely new way of speaking  We now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in our ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the new Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  43  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  31 became the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Col  Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  and definitely the appearance of VMI  were transformed  They were new leaders for a new decade  Needless to say  some of the changes did not sit well with old cadets and led to strained relations between the Corps and the administration for your entire four years and even  in March 1961  to a Corps step off  You became the Class of 1964 in the Spring of 1961  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  New Barracks had been completed a decade before  but Old Barracks was undergoing extensive renovation  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  When you entered  enrollment in the Corps was at absolute capacity of the Barracks  with slightly more than 1050 cadets  To put this in context  in 1950  there were 814 cadets in the Corps  even with New Barracks  in the fall of 1959  there were 1 077 cadets  This large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Center and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall but dubbed by cadets as  puzzle palace  Interestingly enough  its basic design was submitted by a cadet  Annexes were being constructed for Maury Brooke Hall and Nichols Engineering Building  Of special importance to cadets  the PX   located in the concourse   was completely renovated and expanded  The VMI Corps of Cadets marched in the January  1961  Inaugural Parade for President John Kennedy  a day in Washington of sub freezing weather  Later  some members of your class went to Washington and met President Kennedy  gave him a picture representing the cadets at New Market  and received amnesty for all members of the Corps serving on confinement and penalty tours  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  The Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  As a result  cadets were allowed to wear class sweaters instead of formal dress  which gave birth to the designation  twisting dyke  And  as if we needed a reminder  1964 was the year the Beatles arrived and ushered in the so called  British Invasion  These were good times for many of VMI s athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1959  VMI won the Southern Conference and the Big Five Championship  and Coach McKenna was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year  The same achievement was made the next year  the second straight year by  Big Red  to win the Southern Conference Championship  And in 1962  the team did it again  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your first class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market  and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  Soon after  graduation arrived for 203 of your Brother Rats  Your speaker was Virginia Governor Albertis Harrison  What a record you have achieved since those cadet days  I have the results here of a quick and very unscientific study of the accomplishments of member of your class  Taking them in order  87 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  22 made the military a career  22 became attorneys  17 entered health services  15 made government service a career  15 became engineers  13 became educators  6 entered the clergy  5 became scientists  4 became contractors  2 each entered law enforcement or coaching  and one each became farmers or ranchers  journalists  or pilots  Of your class  182 served in the armed forces  with 137 in the Army  3 in the Navy  13 in the Marine Corps  28 in the Air Force  and 1 in the Coast Guard  Two members of your class were killed in Vietnam  Major Richard Butt and journalist Frank Frosch  Yours is an outstanding record for a VMI class  and this evening I want to acknowledge your contributions to the Institute  to our state  and to the nation  Congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunion is also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning abut where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is also a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising our ROTC departments  Greater than 50  of this current 1st Class will take a commission at graduation  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI has won the Big South sportsmanship award seven of the past eight years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move will take place 31 May 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who has done an outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  VMI hosted and won the exciting Military Basketball Classic  Citadel  AF  Army  VMI  in early November  and had a good run in the CIT Tournament before losing in the semi finals  Our baseball team defeated Virginia when they were ranked  1 in the country and also Kentucky in the early baseball season  And  our lacrosse team  for the first time  defeated the U S  Air Force Academy  That same weekend  our Women s Water Polo Team won four of five matches in a VMI hosted tournament at King Hall  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  We rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  on Founders Day  11 November 2013  We have just secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you know that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and a new  80 million indoor training facility  located on Route 11 next to Cameron Hall  for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  endurance training  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction will commence summer 2014  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the best and most capable speed tracks on the eastern seaboard  These three projects transform our south post and also aesthetically and significantly enhance the entrance to Lexington  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support stabilized this year at 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We can offset these costs with financial aid  merit and ROTC scholarships  and other donor support  We are now in the  quiet phase  of our next comprehensive fund raising campaign  and there is great excitement and considerable work ongoing as we organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back  Class of 1964  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams

environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is also a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising our ROTC departments  Greater than 50  of this current 1st Class will take a commission at graduation  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI has won the Big South sportsmanship award seven of the past eight years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move will take place 31 May 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who has done an outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  VMI hosted and won the exciting Military Basketball Classic  Citadel  AF  Army  VMI  in early November  and had a good run in the CIT Tournament before losing in the semi finals  Our baseball team defeated Virginia when they were ranked  1 in the country and also Kentucky in the early baseball season  And  our lacrosse team  for the first time  defeated the U S  Air Force Academy  That same weekend  our Women s Water Polo Team won four of five matches in a VMI hosted tournament at King Hall  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  We rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  on Founders Day  11 November 2013  We have just secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you know that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and a new  80 million indoor training facility  located on Route 11 next to Cameron Hall  for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  endurance training  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction will commence summer 2014  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the best and most capable speed tracks on the eastern seaboard  These three projects transform our south post and also aesthetically and significantly enhance the entrance to Lexington  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support stabilized this year at 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We can offset these costs with financial aid  merit and ROTC scholarships  and other donor support  We are now in the  quiet phase  of our next comprehensive fund raising campaign  and there is great excitement and considerable work ongoing as we organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide

the Class of 1964 Reunion Gen  J H  Binford Peay  III 25 April 2014 Members of the Class of 1964  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved those high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute and I feel very privileged to share it with you  Your reunion also falls in the year of the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute and the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  A new feature film entitled  Field of Lost Shoes  was premiered in Richmond on the 13th of this month  The movie was filmed in Virginia last year and tells the story of seven VMI cadets who fought in the battle  It is currently being shown at independent film festivals with hope of national traction and distribution  Your award today further celebrates that event  and your class  On Founders Day  11 November  we will celebrate the establishment of VMI in 1839 and its contributions to the state and the nation  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s  was a significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  science  and in society were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  Large computers were around  even at VMI  but slide rules and hand calculators still dominated  The thought of personal computers  much less cell phones  smart phones  GPS  night vision goggles and all the other technological marvels we now enjoy were the stuff of science fiction  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of that year  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your second class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  Conflict over the Cuban Missile Crisis was avoided when Russia agreed to halt construction  dismantle  and remove its rockets  and a long but difficult winding down of the Cold War began  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your first class year  Two days after the assassination  the evening gun was fired every half hour from Reveille to Retreat in honor of the slain president  September 7  1960  the day 330 of you matriculated  marked the beginning of VMI s 121st year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  From listening to cadets for five days instruct you to  right face  left face  things changed to hearing  Whoa  Rat   What s for dinner  mister   You re Sent Up  And you discovered that TAC officers could be creative in their  bones  which resulted in walking PTs and confinement  In fact  the archives of your classmates reveal that some of the  bones  from your years were memorable  For example   hayroll rolled counter clockwise   improperly rolled toothpaste tube   excess miscellaneous items in miscellaneous box   unshined light switch  and  allowing two young ladies dressed in cadet uniforms to march to the Mess Hall  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie  Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  In the 1964 BOMB  your historian wrote   Many of us felt that  Mardi Gras  had not developed the true picture  He continued   Not only did we have to learn to walk and think differently  but we had to develop a completely new way of speaking  We now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in our ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the new Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  43  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  31 became the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Col  Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  and definitely the appearance of VMI  were transformed  They were new leaders for a new decade  Needless to say  some of the changes did not sit well with old cadets and led to strained relations between the Corps and the administration for your entire four years and even  in March 1961  to a Corps step off  You became the Class of 1964 in the Spring of 1961  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  New Barracks had been completed a decade before  but Old Barracks was undergoing extensive renovation  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  When you entered  enrollment in the Corps was at absolute capacity of the Barracks  with slightly more than 1050 cadets  To put this in context  in 1950  there were 814 cadets in the Corps  even with New Barracks  in the fall of 1959  there were 1 077 cadets  This large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Center and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall but dubbed by cadets as  puzzle palace  Interestingly enough  its basic design was submitted by a cadet  Annexes were being constructed for Maury Brooke Hall and Nichols Engineering Building  Of special importance to cadets  the PX   located in the concourse   was completely renovated and expanded  The VMI Corps of Cadets marched in the January  1961  Inaugural Parade for President John Kennedy  a day in Washington of sub freezing weather  Later  some members of your class went to Washington and met President Kennedy  gave him a picture representing the cadets at New Market  and received amnesty for all members of the Corps serving on confinement and penalty tours  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  The Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  As a result  cadets were allowed to wear class sweaters instead of formal dress  which gave birth to the designation  twisting dyke  And  as if we needed a reminder  1964 was the year the Beatles arrived and ushered in the so called  British Invasion  These were good times for many of VMI s athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1959  VMI won the Southern Conference and the Big Five Championship  and Coach McKenna was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year  The same achievement was made the next year  the second straight year by  Big Red  to win the Southern Conference Championship  And in 1962  the team did it again  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your first class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market  and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  Soon after  graduation arrived for 203 of your Brother Rats  Your speaker was Virginia Governor Albertis Harrison  What a record you have achieved since those cadet days  I have the results here of a quick and very unscientific study of the accomplishments of member of your class  Taking them in order  87 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  22 made the military a career  22 became attorneys  17 entered health services  15 made government service a career  15 became engineers  13 became educators  6 entered the clergy  5 became scientists  4 became contractors  2 each entered law enforcement or coaching  and one each became farmers or ranchers  journalists  or pilots  Of your class  182 served in the armed forces  with 137 in the Army  3 in the Navy  13 in the Marine Corps  28 in the Air Force  and 1 in the Coast Guard  Two members of your class were killed in Vietnam  Major Richard Butt and journalist Frank Frosch  Yours is an outstanding record for a VMI class  and this evening I want to acknowledge your contributions to the Institute  to our state  and to the nation  Congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunion is also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning abut where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure

the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from

Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and

Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile

Binford Peay  III 25 April 2014 Members of the Class of 1964  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved those high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute and I feel very privileged to share it with you  Your reunion also falls in the year of the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute and the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  A new feature film entitled  Field of Lost Shoes  was premiered in Richmond on the 13th of this month  The movie was filmed in Virginia last year and tells the story of seven VMI cadets who fought in the battle  It is currently being shown at independent film festivals with hope of national traction and distribution  Your award today further celebrates that event  and your class  On Founders Day  11 November  we will celebrate the establishment of VMI in 1839 and its contributions to the state and the nation  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s  was a significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  science  and in society were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  Large computers were around  even at VMI  but slide rules and hand calculators still dominated  The thought of personal computers  much less cell phones  smart phones  GPS  night vision goggles and all the other technological marvels we now enjoy were the stuff of science fiction  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of that year  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your second class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  Conflict over the Cuban Missile Crisis was avoided when Russia agreed to halt construction  dismantle  and remove its rockets  and a long but difficult winding down of the Cold War began  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your first class year  Two days after the assassination  the evening gun was fired every half hour from Reveille to Retreat in honor of the slain president  September 7  1960  the day 330 of you matriculated  marked the beginning of VMI s 121st year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  From listening to cadets for five days instruct you to  right face  left face  things changed to hearing  Whoa  Rat   What s for dinner  mister   You re Sent Up  And you discovered that TAC officers could be creative in their  bones  which resulted in walking PTs and confinement  In fact  the archives of your classmates reveal that some of the  bones  from your years were memorable  For example   hayroll rolled counter clockwise   improperly rolled toothpaste tube   excess miscellaneous items in miscellaneous box   unshined light switch  and  allowing two young ladies dressed in cadet uniforms to march to the Mess Hall  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie  Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  In the 1964 BOMB  your historian wrote   Many of us felt that  Mardi Gras  had not developed the true picture  He continued   Not only did we have to learn to walk and think differently  but we had to develop a completely new way of speaking  We now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in our ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the new Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  43  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  31 became the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Col  Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  and definitely the appearance of VMI  were transformed  They were new leaders for a new decade  Needless to say  some of the changes did not sit well with old cadets and led to strained relations between the Corps and the administration for your entire four years and even  in March 1961  to a Corps step off  You became the Class of 1964 in the Spring of 1961  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  New Barracks had been completed a decade before  but Old Barracks was undergoing extensive renovation  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  When you entered  enrollment in the Corps was at absolute capacity of the Barracks  with slightly more than 1050 cadets  To put this in context  in 1950  there were 814 cadets in the Corps  even with New Barracks  in the fall of 1959  there were 1 077 cadets  This large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Center and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall but dubbed by cadets as  puzzle palace  Interestingly enough  its basic design was submitted by a cadet  Annexes were being constructed for Maury Brooke Hall and Nichols Engineering Building  Of special importance to cadets  the PX   located in the concourse   was completely renovated and expanded  The VMI Corps of Cadets marched in the January  1961  Inaugural Parade for President John Kennedy  a day in Washington of sub freezing weather  Later  some members of your class went to Washington and met President Kennedy  gave him a picture representing the cadets at New Market  and received amnesty for all members of the Corps serving on confinement and penalty tours  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  The Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  As a result  cadets were allowed to wear class sweaters instead of formal dress  which gave birth to the designation  twisting dyke  And  as if we needed a reminder  1964 was the year the Beatles arrived and ushered in the so called  British Invasion  These were good times for many of VMI s athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1959  VMI won the Southern Conference and the Big Five Championship  and Coach McKenna was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year  The same achievement was made the next year  the second straight year by  Big Red  to win the Southern Conference Championship  And in 1962  the team did it again  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your first class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market  and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  Soon after  graduation arrived for 203 of your Brother Rats  Your speaker was Virginia Governor Albertis Harrison  What a record you have achieved since those cadet days  I have the results here of a quick and very unscientific study of the accomplishments of member of your class  Taking them in order  87 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  22 made the military a career  22 became attorneys  17 entered health services  15 made government service a career  15 became engineers  13 became educators  6 entered the clergy  5 became scientists  4 became contractors  2 each entered law enforcement or coaching  and one each became farmers or ranchers  journalists  or pilots  Of your class  182 served in the armed forces  with 137 in the Army  3 in the Navy  13 in the Marine Corps  28 in the Air Force  and 1 in the Coast Guard  Two members of your class were killed in Vietnam  Major Richard Butt and journalist Frank Frosch  Yours is an outstanding record for a VMI class  and this evening I want to acknowledge your contributions to the Institute  to our state  and to the nation  Congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunion is also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning abut where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is also a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising our ROTC departments  Greater than 50  of this current 1st Class will take a commission at graduation  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI has won the Big South sportsmanship award seven of the past eight years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move will take place 31 May 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who has done an outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  VMI hosted and won the exciting Military Basketball Classic  Citadel  AF  Army  VMI  in early November  and had a good run in the CIT Tournament before losing in the semi finals  Our baseball team defeated Virginia when they were ranked  1 in the country and also Kentucky in the early baseball season  And  our lacrosse team  for the first time  defeated the U S  Air Force Academy  That same weekend  our Women s Water Polo Team won four of five matches in a VMI hosted tournament at King Hall  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  We rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  on Founders Day  11 November 2013  We have just secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you know that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and a new  80 million indoor training facility  located on Route 11 next to Cameron Hall  for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  endurance training  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction will commence summer 2014  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the best and most capable speed tracks on the eastern seaboard  These three projects transform our south post and also aesthetically and significantly enhance the entrance to Lexington  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support stabilized this year at 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We can offset these costs with financial aid  merit and ROTC scholarships  and other donor support  We are now in the  quiet phase  of our next comprehensive fund raising campaign  and there is great excitement and considerable work ongoing as we organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back  Class of 1964  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams

at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is also a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising our ROTC departments  Greater than 50  of this current 1st Class will take a commission at graduation  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI has won the Big South sportsmanship award seven of the past eight years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move will take place 31 May 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who has done an outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  VMI hosted and won the exciting Military Basketball Classic  Citadel  AF  Army  VMI  in early November  and had a good run in the CIT Tournament before losing in the semi finals  Our baseball team defeated Virginia when they were ranked  1 in the country and also Kentucky in the early baseball season  And  our lacrosse team  for the first time  defeated the U S  Air Force Academy  That same weekend  our Women s Water Polo Team won four of five matches in a VMI hosted tournament at King Hall  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  We rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  on Founders Day  11 November 2013  We have just secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you know that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and a new  80 million indoor training facility  located on Route 11 next to Cameron Hall  for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  endurance training  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction will commence summer 2014  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the best and most capable speed tracks on the eastern seaboard  These three projects transform our south post and also aesthetically and significantly enhance the entrance to Lexington  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support stabilized this year at 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We can offset these costs with financial aid  merit and ROTC scholarships  and other donor support  We are now in the  quiet phase  of our next comprehensive fund raising campaign  and there is great excitement and considerable work ongoing as we organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back  Class of 1964  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents

Gen  J H  Binford Peay  III 25 April 2014 Members of the Class of 1964  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved those high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute and I feel very privileged to share it with you  Your reunion also falls in the year of the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute and the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  A new feature film entitled  Field of Lost Shoes  was premiered in Richmond on the 13th of this month  The movie was filmed in Virginia last year and tells the story of seven VMI cadets who fought in the battle  It is currently being shown at independent film festivals with hope of national traction and distribution  Your award today further celebrates that event  and your class  On Founders Day  11 November  we will celebrate the establishment of VMI in 1839 and its contributions to the state and the nation  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s  was a significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  science  and in society were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  Large computers were around  even at VMI  but slide rules and hand calculators still dominated  The thought of personal computers  much less cell phones  smart phones  GPS  night vision goggles and all the other technological marvels we now enjoy were the stuff of science fiction  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of that year  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your second class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  Conflict over the Cuban Missile Crisis was avoided when Russia agreed to halt construction  dismantle  and remove its rockets  and a long but difficult winding down of the Cold War began  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your first class year  Two days after the assassination  the evening gun was fired every half hour from Reveille to Retreat in honor of the slain president  September 7  1960  the day 330 of you matriculated  marked the beginning of VMI s 121st year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  From listening to cadets for five days instruct you to  right face  left face  things changed to hearing  Whoa  Rat   What s for dinner  mister   You re Sent Up  And you discovered that TAC officers could be creative in their  bones  which resulted in walking PTs and confinement  In fact  the archives of your classmates reveal that some of the  bones  from your years were memorable  For example   hayroll rolled counter clockwise   improperly rolled toothpaste tube   excess miscellaneous items in miscellaneous box   unshined light switch  and  allowing two young ladies dressed in cadet uniforms to march to the Mess Hall  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie  Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  In the 1964 BOMB  your historian wrote   Many of us felt that  Mardi Gras  had not developed the true picture  He continued   Not only did we have to learn to walk and think differently  but we had to develop a completely new way of speaking  We now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in our ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the new Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  43  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  31 became the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Col  Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  and definitely the appearance of VMI  were transformed  They were new leaders for a new decade  Needless to say  some of the changes did not sit well with old cadets and led to strained relations between the Corps and the administration for your entire four years and even  in March 1961  to a Corps step off  You became the Class of 1964 in the Spring of 1961  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  New Barracks had been completed a decade before  but Old Barracks was undergoing extensive renovation  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  When you entered  enrollment in the Corps was at absolute capacity of the Barracks  with slightly more than 1050 cadets  To put this in context  in 1950  there were 814 cadets in the Corps  even with New Barracks  in the fall of 1959  there were 1 077 cadets  This large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Center and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall but dubbed by cadets as  puzzle palace  Interestingly enough  its basic design was submitted by a cadet  Annexes were being constructed for Maury Brooke Hall and Nichols Engineering Building  Of special importance to cadets  the PX   located in the concourse   was completely renovated and expanded  The VMI Corps of Cadets marched in the January  1961  Inaugural Parade for President John Kennedy  a day in Washington of sub freezing weather  Later  some members of your class went to Washington and met President Kennedy  gave him a picture representing the cadets at New Market  and received amnesty for all members of the Corps serving on confinement and penalty tours  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  The Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  As a result  cadets were allowed to wear class sweaters instead of formal dress  which gave birth to the designation  twisting dyke  And  as if we needed a reminder  1964 was the year the Beatles arrived and ushered in the so called  British Invasion  These were good times for many of VMI s athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1959  VMI won the Southern Conference and the Big Five Championship  and Coach McKenna was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year  The same achievement was made the next year  the second straight year by  Big Red  to win the Southern Conference Championship  And in 1962  the team did it again  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your first class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market  and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  Soon after  graduation arrived for 203 of your Brother Rats  Your speaker was Virginia Governor Albertis Harrison  What a record you have achieved since those cadet days  I have the results here of a quick and very unscientific study of the accomplishments of member of your class  Taking them in order  87 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  22 made the military a career  22 became attorneys  17 entered health services  15 made government service a career  15 became engineers  13 became educators  6 entered the clergy  5 became scientists  4 became contractors  2 each entered law enforcement or coaching  and one each became farmers or ranchers  journalists  or pilots  Of your class  182 served in the armed forces  with 137 in the Army  3 in the Navy  13 in the Marine Corps  28 in the Air Force  and 1 in the Coast Guard  Two members of your class were killed in Vietnam  Major Richard Butt and journalist Frank Frosch  Yours is an outstanding record for a VMI class  and this evening I want to acknowledge your contributions to the Institute  to our state  and to the nation  Congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunion is also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning abut where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is also a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising our ROTC departments  Greater than 50  of this current 1st Class will take a commission at graduation  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI has won the Big South sportsmanship award seven of the past eight years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move will take place 31 May 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who has done an outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  VMI hosted and won the exciting Military Basketball Classic  Citadel  AF  Army  VMI  in early November  and had a good run in the CIT Tournament before losing in the semi finals  Our baseball team defeated Virginia when they were ranked  1 in the country and also Kentucky in the early baseball season  And  our lacrosse team  for the first time  defeated the U S  Air Force Academy  That same weekend  our Women s Water Polo Team won four of five matches in a VMI hosted tournament at King Hall  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  We rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  on Founders Day  11 November 2013  We have just secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you know that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and a new  80 million indoor training facility  located on Route 11 next to Cameron Hall  for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  endurance training  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction will commence summer 2014  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the best and most capable speed tracks on the eastern seaboard  These three projects transform our south post and also aesthetically and significantly enhance the entrance to Lexington  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support stabilized this year at 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We can offset these costs with financial aid  merit and ROTC scholarships  and other donor support  We are now in the  quiet phase  of our next comprehensive fund raising campaign  and there is great excitement and considerable work ongoing as we organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide

Class of 1964 Reunion Gen  J H  Binford Peay  III 25 April 2014 Members of the Class of 1964  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved those high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute and I feel very privileged to share it with you  Your reunion also falls in the year of the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute and the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  A new feature film entitled  Field of Lost Shoes  was premiered in Richmond on the 13th of this month  The movie was filmed in Virginia last year and tells the story of seven VMI cadets who fought in the battle  It is currently being shown at independent film festivals with hope of national traction and distribution  Your award today further celebrates that event  and your class  On Founders Day  11 November  we will celebrate the establishment of VMI in 1839 and its contributions to the state and the nation  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s  was a significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  science  and in society were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  Large computers were around  even at VMI  but slide rules and hand calculators still dominated  The thought of personal computers  much less cell phones  smart phones  GPS  night vision goggles and all the other technological marvels we now enjoy were the stuff of science fiction  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of that year  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your second class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  Conflict over the Cuban Missile Crisis was avoided when Russia agreed to halt construction  dismantle  and remove its rockets  and a long but difficult winding down of the Cold War began  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your first class year  Two days after the assassination  the evening gun was fired every half hour from Reveille to Retreat in honor of the slain president  September 7  1960  the day 330 of you matriculated  marked the beginning of VMI s 121st year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  From listening to cadets for five days instruct you to  right face  left face  things changed to hearing  Whoa  Rat   What s for dinner  mister   You re Sent Up  And you discovered that TAC officers could be creative in their  bones  which resulted in walking PTs and confinement  In fact  the archives of your classmates reveal that some of the  bones  from your years were memorable  For example   hayroll rolled counter clockwise   improperly rolled toothpaste tube   excess miscellaneous items in miscellaneous box   unshined light switch  and  allowing two young ladies dressed in cadet uniforms to march to the Mess Hall  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie  Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  In the 1964 BOMB  your historian wrote   Many of us felt that  Mardi Gras  had not developed the true picture  He continued   Not only did we have to learn to walk and think differently  but we had to develop a completely new way of speaking  We now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in our ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the new Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  43  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  31 became the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Col  Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  and definitely the appearance of VMI  were transformed  They were new leaders for a new decade  Needless to say  some of the changes did not sit well with old cadets and led to strained relations between the Corps and the administration for your entire four years and even  in March 1961  to a Corps step off  You became the Class of 1964 in the Spring of 1961  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  New Barracks had been completed a decade before  but Old Barracks was undergoing extensive renovation  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  When you entered  enrollment in the Corps was at absolute capacity of the Barracks  with slightly more than 1050 cadets  To put this in context  in 1950  there were 814 cadets in the Corps  even with New Barracks  in the fall of 1959  there were 1 077 cadets  This large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Center and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall but dubbed by cadets as  puzzle palace  Interestingly enough  its basic design was submitted by a cadet  Annexes were being constructed for Maury Brooke Hall and Nichols Engineering Building  Of special importance to cadets  the PX   located in the concourse   was completely renovated and expanded  The VMI Corps of Cadets marched in the January  1961  Inaugural Parade for President John Kennedy  a day in Washington of sub freezing weather  Later  some members of your class went to Washington and met President Kennedy  gave him a picture representing the cadets at New Market  and received amnesty for all members of the Corps serving on confinement and penalty tours  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  The Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  As a result  cadets were allowed to wear class sweaters instead of formal dress  which gave birth to the designation  twisting dyke  And  as if we needed a reminder  1964 was the year the Beatles arrived and ushered in the so called  British Invasion  These were good times for many of VMI s athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1959  VMI won the Southern Conference and the Big Five Championship  and Coach McKenna was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year  The same achievement was made the next year  the second straight year by  Big Red  to win the Southern Conference Championship  And in 1962  the team did it again  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your first class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market  and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  Soon after  graduation arrived for 203 of your Brother Rats  Your speaker was Virginia Governor Albertis Harrison  What a record you have achieved since those cadet days  I have the results here of a quick and very unscientific study of the accomplishments of member of your class  Taking them in order  87 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  22 made the military a career  22 became attorneys  17 entered health services  15 made government service a career  15 became engineers  13 became educators  6 entered the clergy  5 became scientists  4 became contractors  2 each entered law enforcement or coaching  and one each became farmers or ranchers  journalists  or pilots  Of your class  182 served in the armed forces  with 137 in the Army  3 in the Navy  13 in the Marine Corps  28 in the Air Force  and 1 in the Coast Guard  Two members of your class were killed in Vietnam  Major Richard Butt and journalist Frank Frosch  Yours is an outstanding record for a VMI class  and this evening I want to acknowledge your contributions to the Institute  to our state  and to the nation  Congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunion is also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning abut where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior

Barracks  in the fall of 1959  there were 1 077 cadets  This large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Center and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall but dubbed by cadets as  puzzle palace  Interestingly enough  its basic design was submitted by a cadet  Annexes were being constructed for Maury Brooke Hall and Nichols Engineering Building  Of special importance to cadets  the PX   located in the concourse   was completely renovated and expanded  The VMI Corps of Cadets marched in the January  1961  Inaugural Parade for President John Kennedy  a day in Washington of sub freezing weather  Later  some members of your class went to Washington and met President Kennedy  gave him a picture representing the cadets at New Market  and received amnesty for all members of the Corps serving on confinement and penalty tours  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  The Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  As a result  cadets were allowed to wear class sweaters instead of formal dress  which gave birth to the designation  twisting dyke  And  as if we needed a reminder  1964 was the year the Beatles arrived and ushered in the so called  British Invasion  These were good times for many of VMI s athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1959  VMI won the Southern Conference and the Big Five Championship  and Coach McKenna was named Southern Conference Coach of the Year  The same achievement was made the next year  the second straight year by  Big Red  to win the Southern Conference Championship  And in 1962  the team did it again  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your first class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market  and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  Soon after  graduation arrived for 203 of your Brother Rats  Your speaker was Virginia Governor Albertis Harrison  What a record you have achieved since those cadet days  I have the results here of a quick and very unscientific study of the accomplishments of member of your class  Taking them in order  87 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  22 made the military a career  22 became attorneys  17 entered health services  15 made government service a career  15 became engineers  13 became educators  6 entered the clergy  5 became scientists  4 became contractors  2 each entered law enforcement or coaching  and one each became farmers or ranchers  journalists  or pilots  Of your class  182 served in the armed forces  with 137 in the Army  3 in the Navy  13 in the Marine Corps  28 in the Air Force  and 1 in the Coast Guard  Two members of your class were killed in Vietnam  Major Richard Butt and journalist Frank Frosch  Yours is an outstanding record for a VMI class  and this evening I want to acknowledge your contributions to the Institute  to our state  and to the nation  Congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunion is also time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning abut where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  reporting 1 June  is BG Jeff Smith  79  who just completed a thirty three  33  year principally in the Army s Signal Corps with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  General Schneiter  as Dean Emeritus  will return to teaching in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who has been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  Class of 1979  who has been  since 2007  now the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Leadership Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Upon the completion of our highly successful ten year Accreditation Reaffirmation in 2007  and responding to new requirements of our Quality Enhancement Plan  the Institute s academic leadership undertook a full review of the academic core curriculum  The Dean and faculty proposed to the Board of Visitors a series of Academic Program Initiatives for study  Those initiatives are currently being implemented with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  These academic initiatives include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant to meet the needs of a changing world  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  and others have ranked VMI  well  in the upper quartile of all colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2013 matriculating cadets   Class of 2017   had over 2000 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  In early August  we matriculated 502 cadets from 35 states and the District of Columbia and four foreign countries  This is among the three largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  55 4 percent were from Virginia  61 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  103 were recruited NCAA athletes  59 percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the liberal arts  That incoming class  2013  had a grade point average of 3 6  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  in August 2013  numbered 1675 cadets with an annual rolling average of 1610 over the past several years  The class of 2018  matriculating in August 2014  will surpass this Class of 2017 in applications and quality  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a value based education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Several weeks ago  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is also a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising our ROTC departments  Greater than 50  of this current 1st Class will take a commission at graduation  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI has won the Big South sportsmanship award seven of the past eight years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  In June  the Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move will take place 31 May 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who has done an outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  VMI hosted and won the exciting Military Basketball Classic  Citadel  AF  Army  VMI  in early November  and had a good run in the CIT Tournament before losing in the semi finals  Our baseball team defeated Virginia when they were ranked  1 in the country and also Kentucky in the early baseball season  And  our lacrosse team  for the first time  defeated the U S  Air Force Academy  That same weekend  our Women s Water Polo Team won four of five matches in a VMI hosted tournament at King Hall  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  We rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  on Founders Day  11 November 2013  We have just secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you know that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and a new  80 million indoor training facility  located on Route 11 next to Cameron Hall  for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  endurance training  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction will commence summer 2014  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the best and most capable speed tracks on the eastern seaboard  These three projects transform our south post and also aesthetically and significantly enhance the entrance to Lexington  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support stabilized this year at 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We can offset these costs with financial aid  merit and ROTC scholarships  and other donor support  We are now in the  quiet phase  of our next comprehensive fund raising campaign  and there is great excitement and considerable work ongoing as we organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back  Class of 1964 Remarks to the Class of 1964 Reunion Gen  J H  Binford Peay  III 25 April 2014 Members of the Class of 1964  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved those high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute and I feel very privileged to share it with you  Your reunion also falls in the year of the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute and the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  A new feature film entitled  Field of Lost Shoes  was premiered in Richmond on the 13th of this month  The movie was filmed in Virginia last year and tells the story of seven VMI cadets who fought in the battle  It is currently being shown at independent film festivals with hope of national traction and distribution  Your award today further celebrates that event  and your class  On Founders Day  11 November  we will celebrate the establishment of VMI in 1839 and its contributions to the state and the nation  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s  was a significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  science  and in society were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  Large computers were around  even at VMI  but slide rules and hand calculators still dominated  The thought of personal computers  much less cell phones  smart phones  GPS  night vision goggles and all the other technological marvels we now enjoy were the stuff of science fiction  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of that year  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your second class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  Conflict over the Cuban Missile Crisis was avoided when Russia agreed to halt construction  dismantle  and remove its rockets  and a long but difficult winding down of the Cold War began  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your first class year  Two days after the assassination  the evening gun was fired every half hour from Reveille to Retreat in honor of the slain president  September 7  1960  the day 330 of you matriculated  marked the beginning of VMI s 121st year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  From listening to cadets for five days instruct you to  right face  left face  things changed to hearing  Whoa  Rat   What s for dinner  mister   You re Sent Up  And you discovered that TAC officers could be creative in their  bones  which resulted in walking PTs and confinement  In fact  the archives of your classmates reveal that some of the  bones  from your years were memorable  For example   hayroll rolled counter clockwise   improperly rolled toothpaste tube   excess miscellaneous items in miscellaneous box   unshined light switch  and  allowing two young ladies dressed in cadet uniforms to march to the Mess Hall  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie  Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  In the 1964 BOMB  your historian wrote   Many of us felt that  Mardi Gras  had not developed the true picture  He continued   Not only did we have to learn to walk and think differently  but we had to develop a completely new way of speaking  We now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in our ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the new Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  43  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  31 became the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Col  Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  and definitely the appearance of VMI  were transformed  They were new leaders for a new decade  Needless to say  some of the changes did not sit well with old cadets and led to strained relations between the Corps and the administration for your entire four years and even  in March 1961  to a Corps step off  You became the Class of 1964 in the Spring of 1961  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered was much like today s Barracks  although it consisted only of Old and New Barracks  New Barracks had been completed a decade before  but Old Barracks was undergoing extensive renovation  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  When you entered  enrollment in the Corps was at absolute capacity of the Barracks  with slightly more than 1050 cadets  To put this in context  in 1950  there were 814 cadets in the Corps  even with New

organize for this endeavor  with public announcement of goals  organization  and plans in fall 2014  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  And in its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  Thank you for your loyalty and continuing support  With all of us working together for the benefit of the cadet  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back
