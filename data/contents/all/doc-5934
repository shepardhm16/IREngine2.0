talk at the 2013 Honor Conference at VMI    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughin  Innocent Man Convicted Tells Conference About Quality of Character LEXINGTON  Va  March 5  2013   Dewey Bozella told participants in VMI s 2013 Honor Conference this morning about the struggles he s faced in his life and the quality of character that was necessary to overcome them  The course of Bozella s life provides examples of the integrity and honor that participants have been exploring throughout the two day conference  Bozella was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1983  spending 26 years in prison before being exonerated  During that time he always maintained his innocence and persevered in the hope that he would one day be proven innocent   Never let fear determine who you are  said Bozella   Never let where you come from determine where you re going  Bozella struggled with drugs and alcohol during his teenage years  but things changed when his brother was murdered  He was making positive choices in his life by his early 20s  learning carpentry and working to better himself  That s when he was first charged with the murder of a 92 year old woman  In 1977 he was held for 28 days  but authorities released him due to the lack of evidence   For the next five years I was doing everything that I could to turn my life around  said Bozella   I was working  and everything was going right  Bozella s turnaround was put on hold when  in 1983  the case was reopened and he was convicted on what was later found to be false testimony  The sentence was 20 years to life   When I was found guilty  believe me  it hurt  I fell down on the floor and cried  said Bozella  He recalled losing hope as he experienced the reality of life in Sing Sing prison with all its indignities   I said  If they re going to treat me like an animal  I m going to act like an animal  For two years I lived like that  said Bozella  recalling that after those first two years  he re examined the course of his life   I decided to change my life  said Bozella   I took advantage of every opportunity I could  Among those opportunities was joining the Sing Sing boxing team  Boxing gave Bozella a way to focus his energies and further develop his character  By 2007  Bozella had come a long way in his mission to better himself  learning three trades  completing 52 certificate programs  and earning bachelor s and a master s degrees  but his life was on hold until his innocence could be proven  Throughout his 26 years of incarceration  Bozella worked to prove his innocence even on occasions when offering a false confession to the prosecutors of the parole board would have meant his freedom   The parole board was waiting for me to tell them I did it  I wouldn t do it  I didn t do it in 1977  I didn t do it in 1983  I didn t do it in 2003  I didn t do it in 2005  and I damn sure wasn t going to do it in 2007  said Bozella  Bozella was vindicated in 2008  when the arresting officer produced exculpatory evidence  And Bozella finally got his chance to box professionally when  at age 52  he faced off against Larry Hopkins in 2011   I went out there and put it on  and I beat him  said Bozella   Don t let anybody tell what you can t do  If I could do that at the age of 52  imagine what you can do  The Honor conference continued this afternoon with a series of workshops and closed with remarks by Ed

Innocent Man Convicted Tells Conference About Quality of Character LEXINGTON  Va  March 5  2013   Dewey Bozella told participants in VMI s 2013 Honor Conference this morning about the struggles he s faced in his life and the quality of character that was necessary to overcome them  The course of Bozella s life provides examples of the integrity and honor that participants have been exploring throughout the two day conference  Bozella was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1983  spending 26 years in prison before being exonerated  During that time he always maintained his innocence and persevered in the hope that he would one day be proven innocent   Never let fear determine who you are  said Bozella   Never let where you come from determine where you re going  Bozella struggled with drugs and alcohol during his teenage years  but things changed when his brother was murdered  He was making positive choices in his life by his early 20s  learning carpentry and working to better himself  That s when he was first charged with the murder of a 92 year old woman  In 1977 he was held for 28 days  but authorities released him due to the lack of evidence   For the next five years I was doing everything that I could to turn my life around  said Bozella   I was working  and everything was going right  Bozella s turnaround was put on hold when  in 1983  the case was reopened and he was convicted on what was later found to be false testimony  The sentence was 20 years to life   When I was found guilty  believe me  it hurt  I fell down on the floor and cried  said Bozella  He recalled losing hope as he experienced the reality of life in Sing Sing prison with all its indignities   I said  If they re going to treat me like an animal  I m going to act like an animal  For two years I lived like that  said Bozella  recalling that after those first two years  he re examined the course of his life   I decided to change my life  said Bozella   I took advantage of every opportunity I could  Among those opportunities was joining the Sing Sing boxing team  Boxing gave Bozella a way to focus his energies and further develop his character  By 2007  Bozella had come a long way in his mission to better himself  learning three trades  completing 52 certificate programs  and earning bachelor s and a master s degrees  but his life was on hold until his innocence could be proven  Throughout his 26 years of incarceration  Bozella worked to prove his innocence even on occasions when offering a false confession to the prosecutors of the parole board would have meant his freedom   The parole board was waiting for me to tell them I did it  I wouldn t do it  I didn t do it in 1977  I didn t do it in 1983  I didn t do it in 2003  I didn t do it in 2005  and I damn sure wasn t going to do it in 2007  said Bozella  Bozella was vindicated in 2008  when the arresting officer produced exculpatory evidence  And Bozella finally got his chance to box professionally when  at age 52  he faced off against Larry Hopkins in 2011   I went out there and put it on  and I beat him  said Bozella   Don t let anybody tell what you can t do  If I could do that at the age of 52  imagine what you can do  The Honor conference continued this afternoon with a series of workshops and closed with remarks by Ed Jurith of the World Anti Doping Agency   John Robertson IV   VMI
