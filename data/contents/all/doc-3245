life long learning and develops citizens of character who anticipate  respond and lead in a complex and changing world  Support of specific programming to further VMI s mission has been provided by the Jackson Hope Fund  To date  four labs have been established in the  Engineering Division  and the Fund has enabled the purchase of state of the art equipment in electrical and civil environmental engineering  The Fund also has made possible the hiring of two full time faculty and part time instructors in graphics and engineering economics  creation of an  aerospace concentration in mechanical engineering and support for cadets to participate in Mini Baja  a national competition that simulates real world engineering design projects and their related challenges   The  Mechanical Engineering Department has benefitted greatly from the Jackson Hope Fund  said Col  Tim Hodges  head of the department   Mechanical engineering has grown to be the largest engineering program at VMI  and the Jackson Hope Fund has helped the Institute meet the demand by providing funding for faculty positions and programs that enhance the curriculum  The addition of new  high quality faculty  the aerospace concentration  and the Mini Baja competition team have been instrumental in attracting talented cadets who wish to study and be part of our program  When the Core Curriculum was revised to add core level science offerings in biology and physics to the existing chemistry core sequence  the Jackson Hope Fund made possible the purchase of biology equipment needed to support this change  The Jackson Hope contribution was essential to meeting the new academic guidelines and to accommodate a growing Corps of Cadets    The  Department of Modern Languages and Cultures also has benefited greatly from the Fund s support  which has enabled more cadets to study abroad and to utilize the new foreign language media center in Scott Shipp Hall     The Jackson Hope Fund has allowed us to ensure continued compatibility of new and evolving language hardware and software that provides the foundation for our Language Media Center  which is vital to second language acquisition  said Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett  head of the department   In addition  the Fund has enabled several cadets to take part in the Experiential Learning Program in Morocco and the U S  Southern Command in Miami both experiences that have enhanced the educational opportunities provided on Post     Arabic enrollment continues to be strong currently about 300 cadets take Arabic and the Fund supports Dr  Mohamed Taifi s position  which has been essential to the growth of the program  she added   Taifi is an outstanding professor who is in demand  A nominee for Virginia s Outstanding Faculty Award  he is a strong mentor for his students  providing cross cultural experiences for both cadets and colleagues  and he is generous with his time and attention both on Post and when he takes students abroad    Another initiatives supported by Jackson Hope funding that spans all disciplines at the Virginia Military Institute is the  Center for Leadership and Ethics  which is designed to advance the understanding  practice and integration of leadership and character development at the Institute  The programs of the Center combined with the academic focus of VMI s leadership minor offer cadets a base of knowledge about leadership and its effective application  These interdisciplinary programs are offered in part by full time faculty secured with Jackson Hope funding    The  Center for Molecular  Cellular and Biological Chemistry  CMCBC was established at VMI with Jackson Hope funds in 2001  and it has brought to the Institute modernized laboratory facilities and two new faculty members with expertise in molecular biology and biochemistry  According to Col  Jim Turner  head of the Biology Department and center director  the impact of the Center has been remarkable  including an increase in cadet undergraduate research projects in these disciplines  a concentration in biochemistry and molecular biology with new course offerings in these cutting edge fields  and a steady stream of graduating cadets being accepted into medical school or associated programs  In addition  the formation of the CMCBC has allowed its faculty to successfully collaborate on research projects with students that resulted recently in the awarding of a  200 000 research grant from the Commonwealth Health Research Board which supports five investigators and five students for two years Academics Home Jackson Hope
