like a math problem   but at the 2012 VMI STEM education conference  held Oct  1 3  more than 500 attending educators and students learned that it and many of the world s most vexing issues are indeed math problems  The conference  which was sponsored by VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  was entitled  Solving America s Toughest Math Problem  Conference organizers defined that problem as motivating more students to study math in college and thereby meet the nation s critical need for more mathematicians  engineers  and computer scientists  With that goal in mind  many sessions centered on how to get students interested in math while they are still in high school  An audience of high school math teachers listened attentively while 2nd Class Cadet Cameron Armstrong and 3rd Class Cadet Stephen Mascioli talked about their research this past summer on utilizing Navy planes and helicopters to stop piracy off the coast of Somalia   a steadily increasing problem that cost the shipping industry between  6 6 billion and  6 9 billion in 2011 alone  The two cadets  along with 1st Class Cadet Ryan Harner  used applied math to attempt a solution to this problem  In answering questions from the audience after the presentation  Armstrong said that the summer research project had allowed him to explore the creative side of math   Math and science are creative fields  and that needs to be expressed more  he commented  Many teachers wanted to know what had turned the cadets on to math  and in each instance the answer was a teacher who allowed for experimentation and multiple approaches to problem solving  It s the kind of inquiry based problem solving that Maj  Randy Cone  VMI assistant professor of math  advocated in the presentation on teaching math that he gave at the conference  In Cone s precalculus class  cadets stand at the front and present their problem solving approach to the class  while Cone stays in the back   Students love the independence  the responsibility for the material  said Cone  But it takes more than teachers  thinking outside the book  for the U S  to regain its competitive edge in STEM fields  argued Dr  Neil deGrasse Tyson  director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History  Tyson told conference attendees that both literally and metaphorically  Americans need to learn to reach for the stars once again   In the 1960s we didn t need  STEM conferences  because we were going to the moon  said Tyson   We were reaching for an unreachable target that all of history said could not be done  It is only that kind of audacious goal setting  Tyson told a group of cadets  faculty  and Washington and Lee University students gathered after his talk  that will spark the national imagination again   NASA s got no business hauling astronauts to and from low earth orbit  said Tyson  who holds a doctorate in astrophysics from Columbia University   That s not space  That s boldly going where hundreds have gone before  Getting students ready for careers in astrophysics and similar fields  though  can only happen when they really understand math   and that means being open to new platforms for math instruction  said Salman Khan  founder of the online Khan Academy  In his address  Khan noted that while traditional schools are bound by a certain amount of time per concept  the Khan Academy allows students to work at their own pace  which is critical for mathematics learning  Furthermore  the donor supported Khan Academy offers a free education to anyone  and thus opens doors for those previously disenfranchised by reasons of poverty  geography  or both  In today s technology driven world  providing a high quality education should be like providing clean and safe drinking water  said Khan   With a little bit of effort  we can do it  By   Mary Price IR   Nov  2012 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site
