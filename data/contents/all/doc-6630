engineering at VMI made history at the end of September when they traveled to New Orleans  La  to compete in an international engineering competition   and emerged as the highest placed U S  team  The cadets entered the Water Environment Federation Technical Exhibition and Conference student design competition with high hopes  The design they d developed for an eco latrine solar shower combination had not only won first place at the statewide competition in Richmond  Va  in May  but it had also been implemented in the small mountain village of Pampoyo  Bolivia  over the summer  At WEFTEC  though  the competition was stiff  Arriving in New Orleans  the cadets found themselves the only undergraduates in attendance and competing against an alumnus  Peerawat Charuwat  13  who s now enrolled in graduate school at Virginia Tech  In the end  though  the 1st Class cadets   Damian Arnaiz  Tyler Brickles  Peter Buehlmann  Andrew Rotermund  and Warner Thomas   found that their design had been so favored by the judges that they d placed not only higher than any other American team  but higher than any team from Virginia had ever placed in this competition  They d also set a record as the highest placed VMI team so far  a team from the Institute that included Charuwat had placed fourth at WEFTEC in 2012   It s a huge  huge feat for a small undergraduate college that s not based on research  noted Lt  Col  Tim Moore II  97  associate professor of civil and environmental engineering who accompanied the cadets to WEFTEC   Ours was the only  project  that was entirely sustainable  noted Brickles when asked what gave the VMI team an edge  The toilets  he explained  are designed to safely compost human waste into fertilizer  and the showers use water heated in two liter soda bottles on the roof  since Pampoyo has no electricity  It was also the only project that had actually been put into practice in the real world   We did it before they even judged us on it  added Thomas  Last summer Brickles  Buehlmann  and Thomas had been part of a group  Keydets Without Borders  that built eco latrine solar shower combinations for villagers who d previously had no toilets  and no access to heated water for bathing  Buehlmann noted that their design is truly universal   We designed it so it can be almost copy pasted in different regions of the world  he said  adding that the only real requirements for implementation are a stable water source and sunlight  All of the cadets agreed that starting early  and including a Bolivian engineer  Afnan Akiyama  in their planning were the key ingredients to their project s success  The idea for the project began over winter furlough last year when Brickles went for a job interview with an engineering firm that is one of the sponsors of the Virginia Water Environment Association s statewide student competition each May  An employee at that firm recommended that Brickles enter that competition  and when Brickles returned to VMI  Moore suggested that he design a toilet and shower combination for use in Bolivia  At that point  Brickles assembled a team  and the group set to work   The first thing we did was look at Google Earth  said Buehlmann   What s there that we can use  Because of the lack of electricity  the cadets had to find another way to heat water for bathing  Soda bottles became the most obvious choice  since the Pampoyo villagers are avid consumers of soda  By February  Akiyama had gotten the word out to the villagers that they needed to save their soda bottles for the coming summer project  All of the cadets praised Akiyama  who s been working with Moore in Bolivia for the past four years and made himself available via Skype as they were finalizing their design last spring   He was able to give us a lot of insight into what it actually looked like down there  which was very helpful  noted Buehlmann  The cadets were likewise grateful that one of the group s members  Arnaiz  had been to Bolivia with Moore already  in the summer of 2013  and thus had firsthand experience with that South American nation   He knew the whole layout before we ever started working on it  said Rotermund  And while all of the cadets were pleased to place so highly at WEFTEC  those who d been to Bolivia agreed that seeing the villagers  delight in the flow of water through a shower was just as meaningful as winning an award  if not more so  Brickles recalled a family that came to see the VMI group off at the bus station   and to tell them that they d just had the first showers of their lives  Overall  Moore and the cadets all noted  the Bolivia project is about changing lives  one toilet and one shower at a time   We re doing this for the people of Pampoyo  said Moore   We re not doing this for the recognition  We re doing this because we believe in the power of engineering to eliminate preventable illness  Moore noted that since Keydets Without Borders began work in Bolivia  infant mortality in Pampoyo has dropped by almost 55 percent  mostly thanks to a clean water supply   That s what been so amazing about this project  said Rotermund   Win or lose at the competitions  this design is making a difference in people s lives and people are actually using it  That thought is so cool  to know that you had something to do with it  By  Mary Price IR   Dec

project is about changing lives  one toilet and one shower at a time   We re doing this for the people of Pampoyo  said Moore   We re not doing this for the recognition  We re doing this because we believe in the power of engineering to eliminate preventable illness  Moore noted that since Keydets Without Borders began work in Bolivia  infant mortality in Pampoyo has dropped by almost 55 percent  mostly thanks to a clean water supply   That s what been so amazing about this project  said Rotermund   Win or lose at the competitions  this design is making a difference in people s lives and

cadets majoring in civil engineering at VMI made history at the end of September when they traveled to New Orleans  La  to compete in an international engineering competition   and emerged as the highest placed U S  team  The cadets entered the Water Environment Federation Technical Exhibition and Conference student design competition with high hopes  The design they d developed for an eco latrine solar shower combination had not only won first place at the statewide competition in Richmond  Va  in May  but it had also been implemented in the small mountain village of Pampoyo  Bolivia  over the summer  At WEFTEC  though  the competition was stiff  Arriving in New Orleans  the cadets found themselves the only undergraduates in attendance and competing against an alumnus  Peerawat Charuwat  13  who s now enrolled in graduate school at Virginia Tech  In the end  though  the 1st Class cadets   Damian Arnaiz  Tyler Brickles  Peter Buehlmann  Andrew Rotermund  and Warner Thomas   found that their design had been so favored by the judges that they d placed not only higher than any other American team  but higher than any team from Virginia had ever placed in this competition  They d also set a record as the highest placed VMI team so far  a team from the Institute that included Charuwat had placed fourth at WEFTEC in 2012   It s a huge  huge feat for a small undergraduate college that s not based on research  noted Lt  Col  Tim Moore II  97  associate professor of civil and environmental engineering who accompanied the cadets to WEFTEC   Ours was the only  project  that was entirely sustainable  noted Brickles when asked what gave the VMI team an edge  The toilets  he explained  are designed to safely compost human waste into fertilizer  and the showers use water heated in two liter soda bottles on the roof  since Pampoyo has no electricity  It was also the only project that had actually been put into practice in the real world   We did it before they even judged us on it  added Thomas  Last summer Brickles  Buehlmann  and Thomas had been part of a group  Keydets Without Borders  that built eco latrine solar shower combinations for villagers who d previously had no toilets  and no access to heated water for bathing  Buehlmann noted that their design is truly universal   We designed it so it can be almost copy pasted in different regions of the world  he said  adding that the only real requirements for implementation are a stable water source and sunlight  All of the cadets agreed that starting early  and including a Bolivian engineer  Afnan Akiyama  in their planning were the key ingredients to their project s success  The idea for the project began over winter furlough last year when Brickles went for a job interview with an engineering firm that is one of the sponsors of the Virginia Water Environment Association s statewide student competition each May  An employee at that firm recommended that Brickles enter that competition  and when Brickles returned to VMI  Moore suggested that he design a toilet and shower combination for use in Bolivia  At that point  Brickles assembled a team  and the group set to work   The first thing we did was look at Google Earth  said Buehlmann   What s there that we can use  Because of the lack of electricity  the cadets had to find another way to heat water for bathing  Soda bottles became the most obvious choice  since the Pampoyo villagers are avid consumers of soda  By February  Akiyama had gotten the word out to the villagers that they needed to save their soda bottles for the coming summer project  All of the cadets praised Akiyama  who s been working with Moore in Bolivia for the past four years and made himself available via Skype as they were finalizing their design last spring   He was able to give us a lot of insight into what it actually looked like down there  which was very helpful  noted Buehlmann  The cadets were likewise grateful that one of the group s members  Arnaiz  had been to Bolivia with Moore already  in the summer of 2013  and thus had firsthand experience with that South American nation   He knew the whole layout before we ever started working on it  said Rotermund  And while all of the cadets were pleased to place so highly at WEFTEC  those who d been to Bolivia agreed that seeing the villagers  delight in the flow of water through a shower was just as meaningful as winning an award  if not more so  Brickles recalled a family that came to see the VMI group off at the bus station   and to tell them that they d just had the first
