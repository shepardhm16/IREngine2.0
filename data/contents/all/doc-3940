Number Understanding Colleague Account Number YOUR COLLEAGUE ACCOUNT NUMBER In order to understand your budget report it will be helpful if you have a fairly good understanding of the Colleague account number that is assigned to each of your individual accounts  A breakdown  by component  of the Colleague Account number is as follows   11   22   333   44444   5555 FUND FUND SRC PROGRAM COST CENTER OBJECT  11    FUND   The first two digits of your account number represents the type FUND  state or local  the account is  If your account number begins with a 1 or a 2 it s a state account  If it begins with a 3 or a 4 it s a local account   22    FUND SOURCE   The second set of digits represents the FUND SOURCE  This is used to identify state funds  The most commonly used fund sources are 03  State Educational   General funds  08  State Auxiliary funds  and 07  State Unique Military Activity funds  If the account is a local fund it s assigned a value of 00   333    PROGRAM   The third

number is the OBJECT code  The OBJECT code represents the type of transaction occurring within the account  For example  an object code beginning with a  4  is a revenue transaction and an object code beginning with a  5  represents an expenditure transaction  BUDGET OBJECT CODE VMI utilizes the budget  pooling  feature of Colleague  This means that expenditure budgets are loaded into a budget pool object code  This allows departments the flexibility to spend their departmental funds as they choose  within disbursement and account restrictions  instead of budgeting at a line item level  There are only two budget pool object codes at VMI and every account has one of these codes assigned to it  Object code 5300  which represents a Non personal services budget and object code 5001 which represents a Total account budget  5300  the NON PERSONAL SERVICE budget code means that only non personal service items may be spent from it  5001 is a TOTAL ACCOUNT budget  This means that all expenditures  personal services and non personal services  will be deducted from this budget  All Institute accounts  state and local  are subject to the guidelines established in the Colleague
