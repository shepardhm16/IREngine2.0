Norfolk Intern of the Year Award Cadet Earns Norfolk Intern of the Year Award One 1st Class cadet got a very pleasant surprise this summer when he was selected over others much older than himself to receive the Marcus D  Jones Intern of the Year Award from the City of Norfolk  John Garrett  a Norfolk native who s majoring in business and economics at VMI  was one of 23 interns participating in Norfolk s Emerging Leader Program  The eight week program drew many graduate students  including law students and doctoral candidates  but it was Garrett who wound up the recipient of the top award at the end of the summer   I was pretty shocked  to get the award  said Garrett  who worked in the city s Office of Budget and Grants Management   It was pretty humbling  Garrett had a fairly strong idea  though  as to why he d been selected  He d been named leader of the intern group  which was given the task this year of putting together an anti bullying campaign for Norfolk Public Schools  Garrett  himself a graduate of the city s Maury High School  took the lead in creating flyers  pamphlets  and a video presentation designed to be shown in classrooms  Garrett and the others presented the fruits of their labors to the Norfolk School Board  which gave a green light to the campaign  and it eventually reached 5 000 students in the city s eight middle schools  Within the Office of Budgets and Grants Management  Garrett worked on four projects  among them a new plan to promote efficiencies in the city s grass cutting operations  He also worked on a revenue sharing agreement between the localities and the schools and put together a recommendation packet for increasing revenue at three city owned golf courses for Norfolk City Council  In addition  he researched grant opportunities for two non profit agencies promoting child welfare  Garrett was expected to put in 40 hours a week  but to no one s surprise  he wound up working more   VMI teaches you a lot about time management  Garrett commented   I worked on so many projects  I figured that if I  hadn t gone  to VMI I d feel swamped    but being here taught me a lot about how to plan my time and prioritize things  As captain of VMI s baseball team  playing 56 games a season  Garrett has learned more than a little bit about time management  He s also co president of the Cadet Investment Group  which manages a portfolio worth more than  200 000 for the VMI Foundation  After graduation  Garrett plans to work in the finance and investment field  with the goal of eventually earning a master s degree in business administration  The internship  though  wasn t just about resume building for a competitive job market   A lot of VMI s teaching is about being a citizen soldier and giving back to your community  and this internship seemed a perfect fit for that  said Garrett   It was a way to give back to the community I ve lived in my whole life  Col  Bob Moreschi  professor of economics and business at VMI  had high praise for how well Garrett represented the Institute  Moreschi said he d recently received an email from Garrett s supervisor in Norfolk  asking if VMI had any candidates for next summer s internship program   He did a great job  said Moreschi of Garrett   He s a good kid  very well meaning  bright  and a hard worker  He added   We have some qualities that we put in these cadets that businesses like   diligence  perseverance  promptness  Norfolk Mayor Paul Fraim  71  who is chairman of VMI s Board of Visitors  likewise praised Garrett for a job very well done  In an email  Fraim wrote   John used excellent judgment while working in a politically sensitive environment    John displayed the characteristics that all interns should aspire to emulate  We are very

got a very pleasant surprise this summer when he was selected over others much older than himself to receive the Marcus D  Jones Intern of the Year Award from the City of Norfolk  John Garrett  a Norfolk native who s majoring in business and economics at VMI  was one of 23 interns participating in Norfolk s Emerging Leader Program  The eight week program drew many graduate students  including law students and doctoral candidates  but it was Garrett who wound up the recipient of the top award at the end of the summer   I was pretty shocked  to get the award  said Garrett  who worked in the city s Office of Budget and Grants Management   It was pretty humbling  Garrett had a fairly strong idea  though  as to why he d been selected  He d been named leader of the intern group  which was given the task this year of putting together an anti bullying campaign for Norfolk Public Schools  Garrett  himself a graduate of the city s Maury High School  took the lead in creating flyers  pamphlets  and a video presentation designed to be shown in classrooms  Garrett and the others presented the fruits of their labors to the Norfolk School Board  which gave a green light to the campaign  and it eventually reached 5 000 students in the city s eight middle schools  Within the Office of Budgets and Grants Management  Garrett worked on four projects  among them a new plan to promote efficiencies in the city s grass cutting operations  He also worked on a revenue sharing agreement between the localities and the schools and put together a recommendation packet for increasing revenue at three city owned golf courses for Norfolk City Council  In addition  he researched grant opportunities for two non profit agencies promoting child welfare  Garrett was expected to put in 40 hours a week  but to no one s surprise  he wound up working more   VMI teaches you a lot about time management  Garrett commented   I worked on so many projects  I figured that if I  hadn t gone  to VMI I d feel swamped    but being here taught me a lot about how to plan my time and prioritize things  As captain of VMI s baseball team  playing 56 games a season  Garrett has learned more than a little bit about time management  He s also co president of the Cadet Investment Group  which manages a portfolio worth more than  200 000 for the VMI Foundation  After graduation  Garrett plans to work in the finance and investment field  with the goal of eventually earning a master s degree in business administration  The internship  though  wasn t just about resume building for a competitive job market   A lot of VMI s teaching is about being a citizen soldier and giving back to your community  and this internship seemed a perfect fit for that  said Garrett   It was a way to give back to the community I ve lived in my whole life  Col  Bob Moreschi  professor of economics and business at VMI  had high praise for how well Garrett represented the Institute  Moreschi said he d recently received an email from Garrett s supervisor in Norfolk  asking if VMI had any candidates for next summer s internship program   He did a great job  said Moreschi of Garrett   He s a good kid  very well meaning  bright  and a hard worker  He added   We have some qualities that we put in these cadets that businesses like   diligence  perseverance  promptness  Norfolk Mayor Paul Fraim  71  who is chairman of VMI s Board of Visitors  likewise praised Garrett for a job very well done  In an email  Fraim wrote   John used excellent judgment while working in a politically sensitive environment    John displayed the characteristics that all interns should aspire to emulate  We are very pleased that John participated in Norfolk s Emerging Leader Program and are very proud of his performance throughout the program  By   Mary Price IR   Dec  2012 Information   Social Sciences Economics   Business Home Degrees   Programs Courses Economics Newsletter Departmental Activities
