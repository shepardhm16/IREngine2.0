Engineers deal with the production  control and utilization of energy and motion in systems to benefit society  The VMI Mechanical Engineering Curriculum prepares cadets for careers in either the military or in the civilian world  Typical civilian career paths might be in aerospace  power  HVAC  bioengineering  manufacturing  management and a host of others  A special feature of the VMI Mechanical Engineering Curriculum is the capstone design course which is done through VMI s Cooperative Engineering Center  Three cadet teams work on  real world  design projects during their final semester  These projects are supplied by local industries who are members of the Cooperative Engineering Center  The cadets have an industry engineer and a faculty member as advisors  These advisors are to help keep the cadets on track  but not to help them solve the problem  The cadets must write a formal design report and give an oral report to supporting industry  NASA Grant to Build on Cadets
