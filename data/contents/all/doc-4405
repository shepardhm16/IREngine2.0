Mechanical Engineering is a very broad curriculum which offers its graduates a wide choice of careers  Mechanical Engineers deal with the production  control and utilization of energy and motion in systems to benefit society  The VMI Mechanical Engineering Curriculum prepares cadets for careers in either the military or in the civilian world  Typical civilian career paths might be in aerospace  power  HVAC  bioengineering  manufacturing  management and a host of others  A special feature of the VMI Mechanical Engineering Curriculum is the capstone design course which is done through VMI s Cooperative Engineering Center  Three cadet teams work on  real world  design projects during their final semester  These projects are supplied by local industries who are members of the Cooperative Engineering Center  The cadets have an industry engineer and a faculty member as advisors  These advisors are to help keep the cadets on track  but not to help them solve the problem  The cadets must write a formal design report and give an oral report to supporting industry  NASA Grant to Build on Cadets  ResultsInterfacing with engineers at NASA s Langley Research Center is an opportunity not afforded most undergraduates  but four 1st Class cadets under the direction of Col  Joe Blandino  professor of mechanical engineering  have been able to do just that  Read More   Twins Miss Brother
