Records Home VMI Official Records  Introduction The VMI Archives is the repository for the Institute s official records of enduring historical  legal  and administrative significance  The Archives staff preserves and catalogs the non current records of permanent value that are generated by or that document the activities of administrators  faculty  and students of the Institute  A few examples of permanent institutional records are the Minutes of the Board of Visitors  records generated by senior administrators such as the Superintendent a host of student and official Institute publications such as catalogues  yearbooks  annual reports  and brochures  and photographs and other media  Official records are distinct from manuscripts  which are collections of personal rather than official institutional papers  Current Institute records remain in the offices in which they are created until they are no longer needed in the course of business  At that time they become non current  and the records of historical and administrative value are transferred to the Archives for permanent retention  Other records with short term value are maintained for a specified period conforming to the state s records retention schedules and are then scheduled for destruction  The Archives staff also oversees the Institute s Records Management Program  Record Groups View the Record Groups List VMI s institutional records are organized using standard archival principles into Record Groups  which are largely derived from the organizational structure of the Institute We hold the complete historical records of the Institute  dating to the founding of the school in 1839  there are no significant gaps All of the important Civil War era records  for example  survived the conflict   The list of Record Groups reflects the major administrative units at VMI  with smaller related units  subgroups  falling under the appropriate larger organizational unit When the Archives was formally established in the mid 1970 s  VMI s organizational chart was reviewed and the major Record Groups were created and given a number  For example  records of the Institute s governing body   the Board of Visitors   became Record Group 1  the records of Office of the Superintendent  Record Group 2  and so on  This Record Groups list has since been revised and is periodically reviewed  In addition to the Record Groups established from the organizational chart  other groups were added that related to types of records or that reflected practical filing arrangement   for example  Publications  Access and Research Guidance Finding the item you need in institutional records can be daunting  Records Groups can contain tens of thousands of individual documents or pages  Institutional records are not typically indexed or cataloged at the item level  rather  larger sets of files have inventories or finding aids  and the inherent logical structure of the files themselves provide guidance  For example  the Records of VMI s first Superintendent  Francis H  Smith  are voluminous  but name indexes are available  If your research topic involves official records  please contact us  Because of our experience in working with the material  we can provide the records that are most likely to yield the information you are seeking  The Virginia Military Institute is a state agency  Its official  or public  records are governed by provisions of the Public Records Act of the Code of Virginia and the Virginia Freedom of Information Act  However  some records are closed to research  Access to certain categories of records is restricted because they are covered by various federal and state statutes governing privacy and confidentiality  Examples of restricted records include student records personnel records  and some other administrative records covered by statutory exemptions  A Brief Administrative History of the Institute Archives  The first VMI cadets matriculated on November 11  1839 and  from the beginning  the Institute has treasured and safeguarded its records  Archival holdings are extensive  dating from 1839 with no major gaps  Although the Institute was burned by Union troops in 1864  records from the Civil War and earlier eras survived  The first attempt to review and consolidate VMI s archival holdings was made by COL William Couper  a graduate of the Class of 1904 who spent much of his career as a senior administrator at VMI  He pursued a life long passion for documenting Institute history and was one of the first to recognize the richness of VMI s historical record  By the 1940 s he had accumulated some of the most significant records and housed them in an area of the library that became known as  Couper s Coop  However  the Archives was not established as an administrative entity with professional management until the mid 1970 s At that time each administrative office was surveyed in order to locate important non current records  and those were transferred to the Archives for cataloging and preservation The Archives occupied a hodgepodge space on the 200 level  bottom floor  of Preston Library for many years  However a new Archives facility was constructed in 1996 as part of the complete renovation of  the library  Today  the department is a thriving research center that serves not only the VMI community  but a wide range of patrons from around the world We are located on the 400 level of Preston Library  one floor below the Main  Circulation Desk  level  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My
