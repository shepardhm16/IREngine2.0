college students and teachers from across the nation as VMI s second biennial Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  opened yesterday  The conference continues today  as the current generation of students takes the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity    LEXINGTON  Va  March 6  2012 Pamela Meyer  author of Liespotting  Proven Techniques to Detect Deception  concluded the first day of VMI s Leadership Conference by describing how falsehoods can be detected through attention to verbal cues  body language  and attitudes indicative of dishonesty   We can learn to identify deception and build organizations and institutions that are based on trust and integrity that is verified and therefore longer lasting  said Meyer  According to Meyer  not only is it necessary to refrain from telling lies  but it is imperative that one not be party to a lie   Lying is a cooperative act  said Meyer   Holding up a code of honor and integrity might require that we get a little bit better at spotting lies  Meyer described verbal cues such as over emphasizing  using formal language  euphemizing  making weak denials  and offering excessive detail  In addition  Meyer gave examples of body language that indicates disingenuousness  such as wringing one s hands  performing grooming gestures  and closing one s eyes while speaking  Meyer illustrated these clues by showing footage from news and films which displayed the telltale signs of deceit  including clips of Bill Clinton  Herman Cain  John Edwards  and Alex Rodriguez  Meyer described American society as a  post truth society  in which Americans have become deeply ambivalent about telling the truth   Why are we ambivalent about the truth  asked Meyer   We re actually pretty ambivalent about ourselves  and we all kind of hate to admit it  but we wish secretly that we were better husbands  better wives  richer  taller  more powerful  smarter  more strategic  better cooks  better golfers  and the list goes on and on    Deceitful behavior is  as Meyer sees it  caused largely by individuals  feelings of inadequacy   Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap  to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were  how we wish our worlds could be with what it s really like  Lying is nothing new  however  As Meyer explained  deception is a part of humans at a primal level  She compared the lying of a child with the lying of Koko the gorilla  who  taught to communicate with sign language  once blamed her pet kitten for ripping a sink out of the wall  However  by building  networks of trust  people can begin to create a more honest society   No matter what changes  human character and integrity are still what s going to matter  said Meyer   John Robertson IV   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT

inadequacy   Lying is an attempt to bridge that gap  to connect our wishes and our fantasies about who we wish we were  how we wish our worlds could be with what it s really like  Lying is nothing new  however  As Meyer explained  deception is a part of humans at a primal level  She compared the lying of a child with the lying of Koko the gorilla  who  taught to communicate with sign language  once

Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  opened yesterday  The conference continues today  as the current generation of students takes the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity    LEXINGTON  Va  March 6  2012 Pamela Meyer  author of Liespotting  Proven Techniques to Detect Deception  concluded the first day of VMI s Leadership Conference by describing how falsehoods can be detected through attention to verbal cues  body language  and attitudes indicative of dishonesty   We can learn to identify deception and build organizations and institutions that are based on trust and integrity that is verified and therefore longer lasting  said Meyer  According to Meyer  not only is it necessary to refrain from telling lies  but it is imperative that one not be party to a lie   Lying is a cooperative act  said Meyer   Holding up a code of honor and integrity might require that we get a little bit better at spotting lies  Meyer described verbal cues such as over emphasizing  using formal language  euphemizing  making weak denials  and offering excessive detail  In addition  Meyer gave examples of body language that indicates disingenuousness  such as wringing one s hands  performing grooming gestures  and closing one s eyes while speaking  Meyer illustrated these clues by showing footage from news and films which displayed the telltale signs of deceit  including clips of Bill Clinton  Herman Cain  John Edwards  and Alex Rodriguez  Meyer described American society as a  post truth society  in which Americans have become deeply ambivalent about telling the truth   Why are we ambivalent about the truth  asked Meyer   We re actually pretty ambivalent about ourselves  and we all kind of hate to admit it  but we wish secretly that we were better husbands  better wives  richer  taller  more powerful  smarter  more strategic  better cooks  better golfers  and the list
