NEW CADETS  New cadets who fail to complete one full academic semester of activity will be reviewed for readmission by the Admissions Office based on the standards used for admittance to VMI for the year of re application  FOR ALL CADETS  To be academically eligible to return it is necessary for cadets to meet the Minimum Academic Standards for Readmission listed in Table 1 below  These guidelines outline the minimum hours required towards degree completion and minimum institutional GPA based on the number of full time terms in attendance at VMI  Meeting the minimum standard does not guarantee readmission   a full review of a cadet s academic record at and away from VMI will take place to determine whether a cadet has successfully completed academic activity and can return to successfully complete his her academic program at the institute  The Institute reserves the right to deny readmission to any cadet that has failed to show progress towards his or her degree and or major  or who has demonstrated that he she does not have sufficient academic background to be successful at the Virginia Military Institute  TABLE 1  MINIMUM ACADEMIC STANDARD FOR READMISSION Full

CORRECTING DEFICIENCIES A cadet who wishes to improve his her grade point average and or cumulative hours towards graduation should consider the following  To raise cumulative GPA  The best way to raise a grade point average is to attend the VMI summer session or another college and repeat failed courses  Repeating courses in which a  D  grade was received will also improve the grade point average  but will not increase the hours passed  New courses taken at another college will not affect the grade point average  To raise number of hours passed  This may be done by attending VMI Summer Session or by attending another college and taking new courses or repeating courses failed at VMI  Repeating courses in which a  D  grade was received will not raise hours passed  Cadets are reminded that there is a maximum limit of 18 credit hours which can be transferred to VMI for credit earned during summer session  winter session and internet courses  after matriculation  Before taking courses at another college  To assure transferability  advance approval must be obtained from the heads of the department in which the VMI courses are taught  the department head of the cadet s major  and the Registrar s Office  NOTE  Course approvals do not imply that a cadet meets the minimum standard to return to VMI  If an individual assessment needs to be conducted to assure that the proposed activity is sufficient to return  it is the responsibility of the cadet to seek a personal evaluation of his her individual record from the respective department  academic advisor or the Registrar s Office  Transfer credit from another college  Transfer hours from another college are accepted only if the institution is regionally accredited and the grade earned is a  C  or better  Grades earned

option  For any class repeated a second time  the last grade counts in the GPA  Courses repeated after two attempts at VMI will include all grades attempted in the cumulative average except for the first attempt  For courses repeated after a second time based on transfer credit  the class with an earned grade of C or better will be accepted towards a cadet s program  however  grade replacement will not be allowed  Cadets who have left the Institute and do not meet the academic readmission criteria are encouraged to work with their academic advisers to develop a plan as to how the cadet intends to meet the minimum academic criteria for readmission  All cadets will be required to provide evidence of success  and supply an official transcript as evidence of satisfactory completion
