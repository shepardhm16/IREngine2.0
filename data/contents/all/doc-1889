period  two or three hours  of laboratory or supervised research or field work per week during a single semester  Thus a course that meets for three class hours and one laboratory period each week during one semester usually carries credit for four semester hours  In the following course descriptions the figures on the title lines indicate  in order  the class hours per week  the laboratory or field work hours per week  and the semester hours credit  For example  the figures  3 2 4  mean that the class meets three times a week for one hour classroom sessions and has two hours of laboratory

All cadets who enter with two or more entrance units in a modern foreign language are given placement tests and are placed in appropriate courses on the basis of the test results  their previous high school language coursework  and after consultation with the department head of modern languages  A single year of a foreign language shall count toward meeting graduation requirements only when the cadet is studying a second language or is taking a language as an elective  Classroom work is supplemented with computer aided language instruction in a wellequipped Language Learning Center  Prerequisites  Cadets must demonstrate proficiency in ML 101 in order to be admitted into ML 102  They must  similarly  demonstrate proficiency in ML 102 before enrolling in ML 201  and in ML 201 before enrolling in ML 202 204  Proficiency in ML 202 204 is a prerequisite for admission to 300 level courses  Completion of two 300 level courses or their equivalent is expected before enrollment in any 400  level course  Once a cadet has completed work at the 202 204 level  he she may not return to the elementary level course for credit  Cadets who present three or more years of a high school language or demonstrate native or near native language abilities may not enroll at the elementary level of that language  Such students will have the choice of enrolling either in the first semester intermediate level of that language or in the first semester elementary course of a different language ARABIC Department of Modern Languages and Cultures Department Head  Colonel Bulger Barnett All
