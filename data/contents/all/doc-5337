that they will abstain from all thoughtless levity and from all forms of indiscretion and immorality and that they will remember that called into service for duty as men they will acquit themselves like men and as true sons of a common mother  His own word stands pledged for this  He looks to each and every one to redeem it  It is important for the order as well as efficiency of the Institution that the regular duties may proceed with as little interruption as possible  A moment s reflection will show the necessity of this  Let no boisterous noise be heard at any time and let those who remain on duty at the Institute remember that their duty at home is a trust also  in which their fidelity may be tried at any moment  Be faithful to all duties and especially on the alert for night
