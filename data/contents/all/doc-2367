Marketing Project Cadets in Dr  Bruce MacDonald s advertising class are applying marketing principles to a NASCAR driver with a VMI connection  Trey Jarrell  17 year old son of alumnus Roger Jarrell  91  was named rookie of the year in NASCAR s Whelen Series last year  Sponsorships play a vital role in a driver s continued success  and it is the task of cadets to gain more sponsorships for him   This is a school project but it has a real life goal behind it  said Cadet Nicolas Mari  14   I didn t know until doing this project  doing the research  that if you don t have the right sponsor people might not like  the driver  During a visit to the class earlier this semester  the Jarrells met with cadets and provided them with statistics about the sport s demographics to give them a starting point  Many were surprised by the information   You ve got to look at the customer   people who watch NASCAR   and it s a lot more dynamic than I thought  said Cadet John Clauff  14  One important factor to consider when choosing a sponsor is to pick one that makes sense  Because of Trey Jarrell s age  some cadets are looking to companies not traditionally associated with NASCAR   We re looking toward smaller  new  kind of edgy companies  explained Cadet Conner Mays  14   He s young  so  fans  can identify in that aspect  With every advertising class MacDonald has taught at VMI  he has assigned a practical group project such as this  Having worked in the marketing business for over 30 years before becoming a professor  he brings a wealth of real world knowledge to cadets   Case studies are fun  but the thing  cadets  remember is doing it  you don t just sit and listen to a lecture  he said  The task of formulating a plan to convince a company to sponsor a driver could be daunting  but MacDonald has given cadets sound advice   I tell them to talk to people who have connections with the sport  he said   Consider him not as a driver  but an entertainer   There s a lot of money to be made in  NASCAR  The audiences and publicity are huge  he  continued  During the first several weeks of the semester cadets formulated ideas  such as the target audience  which companies to contact  and how to contact them  They are now putting their strategies into action and will present their findings the last week of class  Of course  they will not be graded on how many companies actually commit money  but on the content of their plan and presentation  Although it may be difficult to point to any immediately visible results of the project  MacDonald is hopeful for future possibilities   If I can look at Trey Jarrell s car or uniform a couple of years from now and I see a logo that I remember the cadets identified  that would be wonderful  he said  By   Daniel
