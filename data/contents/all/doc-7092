Institute is unique in its military requirements  Institute Regulations require that all Cadets complete four years of ROTC training in one of the three ROTC programs  Army  Navy Marine  or Air Force  The VMI system is designed to prepare qualified Cadets for a military commission upon graduation  but there is no requirement that Cadets seek a commission  The Naval ROTC Unit provides two programs in which Cadets may enroll  Successful completion of the Naval ROTC curriculum will satisfy VMI s military requirements for graduation and may lead to a wide variety of career and reserve opportunities in the Navy and Marine Corps  NAVAL ROTC and Virginia Military Institute  The Naval ROTC Unit was established at VMI on 1 July 1974  NROTC classes commenced with the beginning of the school term in August 1974  The establishment of the VMI NROTC Unit is a continuation of the long standing tradition of mutual respect and service between VMI and the Naval service  especially the U S  Marine Corps  Many VMI alumni have attained flag rank in the Navy and Marine Corps  Among those who have had distinguished careers are Generals Lemuel C  Shepherd  Jr  and Randolph M  Pate  both former Commandants of the Marine Corps  and Lieutenant General Lewis B   Chesty  Puller  a famous Marine combat commander and five time recipient of the Navy Cross  Another former Commandant of the Marine Corps  General John A  Lejeune  served as VMI s superintendent  as did Major General George R  E  Shell  USMC  The NROTC Unit at VMI is one of four NROTC units in Virginia and 58 nationwide  merging the finest traditions of VMI and the Naval Service  This Unit is creating many special opportunities for VMI Midshipmen  The purpose of this document is to outline the goals  requirements and opportunities of the Naval ROTC program at VMI  VMI Purpose and Naval ROTC Mission  The basic purpose of VMI is  to provide academic study of the highest possible quality  conducted in  and

ideals of duty  honor  and loyalty in order to commission them as naval officers who possess a basic professional background  are motivated toward careers in the naval service and have a potential for future development in mind and character and are prepared to assume the highest responsibilities of command  citizenship  and government  The NROTC students  called Midshipmen  are fully integrated members of the Corps of Cadets  participating in all Cadet academic  military  athletic  and social functions  They wear the prescribed Cadet uniforms throughout their Cadetship  During summer training with Navy and Marine Corps units  they wear their distinctive Midshipmen uniforms  Career Opportunities  Officer commissions are attainable in both the Navy and Marine Corps  The professional

with either ground or aviation forces  This can include duty  for example  as a Marine infantry  armor  artillery  communications  or engineer officer  A Marine aviator may choose to fly helicopters  fixed winged fighter attack aircraft or multi engine transportation aircraft  Midshipmen are exposed to many aspects of the Naval service before they make their professional choice  The Naval Science
