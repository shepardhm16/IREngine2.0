biology department s new Tropical Marine Biology course immersed cadets in the ecosystems of Belize and gave them the chance to explore everything from sharks to pufferfish in an unforgettable way   This is a hands on thing  you learn the species so much easier by going down there and experiencing  seeing  feeling  said Capt  Deanne Moosman  an instructor of biology who recently moved to the Department of Physical Education  Moosman led the group along with Lt  Col  Paul Moosman  98  associate professor of biology   I was excited to see the cadets in awe of all these creatures in the water  The trip took place May 17 24  The Belize Marine TREC   Tropical Research and Education Center   located on Ambergris Caye  Belize  hosted the group  offering cadets the chance to experience the wildlife inhabiting the surrounding mangrove swamps and coral reefs firsthand   It s a field intensive course  so we weren t in the classroom much  said Deanne Moosman   Most of the experience was going to these sites  snorkeling around the coral reefs or mangrove swamps  and seeing the behavior of the species  Having studied the species they might encounter beforehand  cadets had favorite quarries to look out for   One of the big highlights for me was seeing the spotted eagle rays  I was really looking forward to that  said Vania Murcia  17   By the end of the trip there were two big ones swimming right beside me  That was incredible  they re really majestic creatures  Besides the hours of snorkeling each day  the four credit hour course required each student to maintain a field journal  write a paper  and take a practical   On the surface  it seems like that many credits in such a short period of time is undoable  but they re spending every moment of the day in this environment  said Paul Moosman   It s a different approach  It s constantly in the environment learning all the time  In addition to the instruction offered by the Moosmans  the center s experts offered knowledge about the species and their environment   We would have briefs on the boat from the research station s director  Ken Mattes  said Matthew Clausen  15   He would take us through a history of the location and what we could expect to find there in terms of organisms  Both Deanne and Paul Moosman studied at Belize Marine TREC while attending graduate school at Eastern Kentucky University   It worked out wonderfully  said Deanne Moosman   We had experience being down there  so we knew the facility  the area  the people  and the species that are there  The trip breaks new ground for the biology department  which expects it to be the first of many study abroad field biology courses that will take cadets to locations where they can observe unfamiliar ecosystems   Part of any good field biology program  in my mind  are these courses that will allow students to go and learn in depth and have these experiential moments in the field  said Paul Moosman   This has opened up the door for more of these  and the department plans to do this on a regular basis from now on  Snorkeling at night was one of the highlights of the trip  allowing the group to see species and behaviors that are not visible in the daytime   It s like a whole different world down there  The only thing you can see is where the flashlights are shining  said Deanne Moosman   It gets the adrenaline going too  The water is pushing you around and you don t want to touch the coral which is all around you  Safety was a primary concern for the trip  and one of the prerequisites for the course was PE 101  Basic Swimming and Survival   The course requires a level of athleticism and swimming ability  said Deanne Moosman   We had several swim tests leading up to this course to make sure everyone would be comfortable in the water  The many hours that the cadets spent in the water led to a special connection with the location   You get a sense of how delicate that environment is  We can always talk about the human impact on that environment  but you don t really make the connection until you go down there and see those species and see the human impact  said Deanne Moosman   The

111 Smith Hall Lexington  VA 24450 Belize  Four Credits and a Whole Lot of Swimming LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  21  2014   This summer  the biology department s new Tropical Marine Biology course immersed cadets in the ecosystems of Belize and gave them the chance to explore everything from sharks to pufferfish in an unforgettable way   This is a hands on thing  you learn the species so much easier by going down there and experiencing  seeing  feeling  said Capt  Deanne Moosman  an instructor of biology who recently moved to the Department of Physical Education  Moosman led the group along with Lt  Col  Paul Moosman  98  associate professor of biology   I was excited to see the cadets in awe of all these creatures in the water  The trip took place May 17 24  The Belize Marine TREC   Tropical Research and Education Center   located on Ambergris Caye  Belize  hosted the group  offering cadets the chance to experience the wildlife inhabiting the surrounding mangrove swamps and coral reefs firsthand   It s a field intensive course  so we weren t in the classroom much  said Deanne Moosman   Most of the experience was going to these sites  snorkeling around the coral reefs or mangrove swamps  and seeing the behavior of the species  Having studied the species they might encounter beforehand  cadets had favorite quarries to look out for   One of the big highlights for me was seeing the spotted eagle rays  I was really looking forward to that  said Vania Murcia  17   By the end of the trip there were two big ones swimming right beside me  That was incredible  they re really majestic creatures  Besides the hours of snorkeling each day  the four credit hour course required each student to maintain a field journal  write a paper  and take a practical   On the surface  it seems like that many credits in such a short period of time is undoable  but they re spending every moment of the day in this environment  said Paul Moosman   It s a different approach  It s constantly in the environment learning all the time  In addition to the instruction offered by the Moosmans  the center s experts offered knowledge about the species and their environment   We would have briefs on the boat from the research station s director  Ken Mattes  said Matthew Clausen  15   He would take us through a history of the location and what we could expect to find there in terms of organisms  Both Deanne and Paul Moosman studied at Belize Marine TREC while attending graduate school at Eastern Kentucky University   It worked out wonderfully  said Deanne Moosman   We had experience being down there  so we knew the facility  the area  the people  and the species that are there  The trip breaks new ground for the biology department  which expects it to be the first of many study abroad field biology courses that will take cadets to locations where they can observe unfamiliar ecosystems   Part of any good field biology program  in my mind  are these courses that will allow students to go and learn in depth and have these experiential moments in the field  said Paul Moosman   This has opened up the door for more of these  and the department plans to do this on a regular basis from now on  Snorkeling at night was one of the highlights of the trip  allowing the group to see species and behaviors that are not visible in the daytime   It s like a whole different world down there  The only thing you can see is where the flashlights are shining  said Deanne Moosman   It gets the adrenaline going too  The water is pushing you around and you don t want to touch the coral which is all around you  Safety was a primary concern for the trip  and one of the prerequisites for the course was PE 101  Basic Swimming and Survival   The course requires a level of athleticism and swimming ability  said Deanne Moosman   We had several swim tests leading up to this course to make sure everyone would be comfortable in the water  The many hours that the cadets spent in the water led to a special connection with the location   You get a sense of how delicate that environment is  We can always talk about the human impact on that environment  but you don t really make the connection until you go down there and see those species and see the human impact  said Deanne Moosman   The things we do in Virginia impact the environments in Belize    John
