concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement   In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors   A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration   When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help  Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology   In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Col  Kathleen
