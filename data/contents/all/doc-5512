Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator C  Flint Webb  Project Manager  Leidos  Engineering   Technology Solutions Division   Overview of the Climate Action Plan  Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan   Status of Legal Challenges Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator George R  Namie  Senior Air Quality Specialist  Leidos   Overview of Recent Developments  NAAQS  Citizen Challenges  Aggregation Daniel B  Schulson  J D  Beveridge   Diamond  P C  The panelist will discuss recent developments that have air permitting implications  including those relating to GHGs  and EPA s regulatory actions relating to startup  shutdown and malfunction  SSM SIP call  In addition  the panelist will discuss notable recent court decisions  such as those affecting source aggregation and statute of limitations issues  and how they affect permitting both at the federal and state levels    Air Permitting   A State Perspective Tamera Thompson  Manager  Office of Air Permit Programs  Virginia DEQ VA DEQ s perspective on some of the current air permitting issues  Topics covered will include the incorporation of start up and shutdown requirements in permits as a result of recent EPA lawsuits and EPA s SSM SIP Call  greenhouse gas  GHG  permitting  and trends with Title V fees    Cost Reductions through Predictive Emissions Monitoring Matt Traister  Vice President  O Brien   Gere Session 4 Enforcement of Air Regulations  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Federal Enforcement Trends and Recent Developments and NextGen Enforcement Tools Alec Zacaroli  J D  Haynes and Boone This presentation will focus on EPA s  Next Generation  enforcement initiative  providing an overview of the key principles and policies behind this approach  followed by a particular focus on the empowerment and role of non governmental organizations  including citizens  in the enforcement process  We will look  in particular  at how increased scrutiny by citizen groups and other players could alter the enforcement landscape in coming years    Air Compliance and Enforcement   A State Perspective Kerri Nicholas  Director of Air Enforcement  Virginia DEQ Todd Alonzo  Manager   Officer of Air Compliance Coordination  Virginia DEQ  This presentation will provide an overview of air compliance and enforcement activities in recent years around the Commonwealth  We will discuss inspection planning and strategies  regional and central office roles and coordination of cases with EPA    Title TBD Eric Schaeffer  Director  Environmental Integrity Project     Chesapeake Bay Session 1 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay I Moderator Ann Jennings  Virginia Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Stream Monitoring Trends Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission In 2012  HRPDC developed regional recommendations based on Virginia s Phase II Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  including future research and model revisions  policy and funding needs and 18 alternate BMPs that were not included in the Bay model  The presentation will analyze which recommendations were adopted and which have failed to gain acceptance    Prince George s County CBP3 Experience Melissa Cutter  VP   Partnership Development  Corvias Solutions   Chesapeake Bay Track   Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Land Cover Project Phase 6 Land Use Lyndsay Duncan  Project Manager  WorldView Solutions  Inc  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  VDEQ  and the Virginia Geographic Information Network  VGIN  have partnered with WorldView Solutions  Inc  a Richmond based GIS and technology consulting firm  to develop a 1 meter resolution land cover GIS dataset statewide  The final  publically available raster and vector data products will serve as a valuable resource to Virginia localities calculating impervious land area for stormwater management  detecting change related to development  and future land use planning  These land cover products will be sufficiently documented and segmented to support further sub classification by stakeholders seeking additional granularity  Land cover areas developed within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed will serve as Virginia s land use input to the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase 6 suite of modeling tools  This presentation will provide an overview of the specifications and methodologies used in development of the Commonwealth s land cover product    Chesapeake Bay Track   Phase 6 Model Rich Batiuk  Associate Director for Science  Analysis and Implementation  U S  Environmental Protection Agency   Optimization Olivia Devereux  MS

Negotiation EPA will be developing expectations for jurisdictions  development of Phase III Watershed Implementation Plans  WIPs  in 2017 2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025  Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners  The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development  evaluation  implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025  This assessment is based on conversations with 122 individuals from federal  state  and local government  the private sector  and non governmental organizations  Because of the interest in learning what helped and what hindered local implementation  a substantial proportion of the conversations occurred with those directly involved with local efforts    Chesapeake Bay Track    Virginia s Locality Outreach Approach for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  Joan Salvati  Manager  Local Government Assistance Programs  Water Division  Virginia DEQ As the jurisdictions within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed begin the planning process for the development of Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  a significant challenge will be to engage local elected officials  local staff and non governmental organizations  NGOs  and enlist their input on identifying pollutant reducing strategies to be used in the Phase III WIP  Virginian is in the process of finalizing a work plan that will lay out a locality outreach approach that includes three phases of the WIP III planning process  education on process and expectations  strategy development  and WIP Drafting  This approach has been based on EPA s Action Plan for Increased Local Partner Engagement and the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment  The outreach approach also builds on DEQ s experience working with local governments on the Phase II WIP and the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and Stormwater program outreach initiatives  Climate Change Impacts in

Collaboration for Effective Environmental Advocacy Moderator TBD   Building a  Triangle of Resistance  to a Mega Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia    Collaboration in Appalachia  the Clinch River Valley Initiative Frank Dukes  Ph D  University of Virginia   Institute for Environmental Negotiation The Clinch River Valley Initiative  CRVI  is a collaborative effort in Southwest Virginia  focusing on the Clinch River Valley  one of the most biodiverse river systems in North America  Working at a watershed scale with many local partners  this

by small solar companies looking for geographic market trends  Utilizing a time lapsed version of this tool  a spatial and temporal analysis was conducted in order to identify the events which catalyzed the consumer s decision to install  including but not limited to community co op initiatives and government incentives  Furthermore  all available residential solar customers were surveyed in order to concretely ascertain their motives for adoption and acquire consolidated feedback on the effectiveness of initiatives and incentives  With concerns of global climate change  national energy security  and local air quality at the forefront of the public s mind  solar photovoltaic market penetration provides a comprehensive avenue towards a more sustainable Virginia  Session 3

combines a host of technologies including solar panels  residential wind turbines  geothermal wells  ultra tight walls  windows  and doors  extra insulation  and a sophisticated building management system to reduce power needs and generate all the electricity needed to run the building over the course of a year  The building received LEED Platinum Certification in July  2015 and CBF anticipates the BEC will become the first building in Virginia  and one of 10 buildings internationally to receive Living Building Certification in 2016    Building a Sustainable Pavement System Trenton Clark  Director of Engineering  Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management

Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Jamie Mitchell  Chief of Technical Services  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept  Dan Holloway  P G  Senior Project Manager Hydrogeologist  CH2M Ed Snyder  P E  B C E E  Vice President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in

in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator C  Flint Webb  Project Manager  Leidos  Engineering   Technology Solutions Division   Overview of the Climate Action Plan  Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan   Status of Legal Challenges Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in

Eric Schaeffer  Director  Environmental Integrity Project     Chesapeake Bay Session 1 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay I Moderator Ann Jennings  Virginia Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Stream Monitoring Trends Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water

Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark

Collaboration for Effective Environmental Advocacy Moderator TBD   Building a  Triangle of Resistance  to a Mega Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia

Director of Engineering  Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management

Facilities Christopher Mueller  Project Manager  Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development  LID based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County  VA  To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities  they need to be adequately designed  built  inspected  and maintained  The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality  performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life  In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District  the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services  Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division  used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County  All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria  permitted by the county  and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions  As part of the study  existing structural specifications such as ponding depth  facility footprint  soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties  among others  were evaluated  An inventory of the existing plants  comparison with the original planting plan  and the dominant invasive and volunteer plants was prepared  Lack of construction compliance with the original design was one of the

efforts of one University in three areas related to formulating policy and implementing a campus environment that fulfills this vision  In 2009  the GW Office of Sustainability published the GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy based on input from internal and external stakeholders to integrate sustainability into academics  research  practice  and outreach  The Strategy addresses the university s impact and dependence on resource systems on campus  in the Chesapeake Bay eco region  and globally  It provides a framework for specific action plans such as a zero waste plan  climate action plan  and water plan  Currently a cross functional team of faculty  staff  and students are working on Sustainable Landscapes Guidelines  This document will encourage campus planning that addresses the six goals of the Strategy  The Guidelines provide an analysis of the physical condition of the campus landscape as well as social and behavioral aspects of the use of outdoor space by students  faculty  staff and neighbors  The Guidelines build a regenerative design approach for the campus landscape  GW s Square 80 Plaza is a Sustainable Sites Initiative  SITES  certified pilot project  The SITES program for sustainable landscape development  administered by the Green Business Certification  Inc   GBCI  provides tools  guidelines and performance benchmarks for ecologically resilient landscapes that measure performance in the economic  environmental  and social dimensions of sustainability  Square 80 Plaza is a powerful example of sustainable design  it advances the goals of GW s Ecosystem Enhancement Strategy in measurable ways while providing much needed green open space in a highly urban context  Session 7 Environmental Management Case Studies Moderator TBD   Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling

President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in theglobal energy market   NativePlants for Security  Environment and Health KathrynPeterson Lambert  Effortless Language  Planting Culture and Class   The15 minute brief presentation gives an overview

Session 1  Air Quality and Regulation  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator C  Flint Webb  Project Manager  Leidos  Engineering   Technology Solutions Division   Overview of the Climate Action Plan  Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan   Status of Legal Challenges Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator George R  Namie  Senior Air Quality Specialist  Leidos   Overview of Recent Developments  NAAQS  Citizen Challenges  Aggregation Daniel B  Schulson  J D  Beveridge   Diamond  P C  The panelist will discuss recent developments that have air permitting implications  including those relating to GHGs  and EPA s regulatory actions relating to startup  shutdown and malfunction  SSM SIP call  In addition  the panelist will discuss notable recent court decisions  such as those affecting source aggregation and statute of limitations issues  and how they affect permitting both at the federal and state levels    Air Permitting   A State Perspective Tamera Thompson  Manager  Office of Air Permit Programs  Virginia DEQ VA DEQ s perspective on some of the current air permitting issues  Topics covered will include the incorporation of start up and shutdown requirements in permits as a result of recent EPA lawsuits and EPA s SSM SIP Call  greenhouse gas  GHG  permitting  and trends with Title V fees    Cost Reductions through Predictive Emissions Monitoring Matt Traister  Vice President  O Brien   Gere Session 4 Enforcement of Air Regulations  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Federal Enforcement Trends and Recent Developments and NextGen Enforcement Tools Alec Zacaroli  J D  Haynes and Boone This presentation will focus on EPA s  Next Generation  enforcement initiative  providing an overview of the key principles and policies behind this approach  followed by a particular focus on the empowerment and role of non governmental organizations  including citizens  in the enforcement process  We will look  in particular  at how increased scrutiny by citizen groups and other players could alter the enforcement landscape in coming years    Air Compliance and Enforcement   A State Perspective Kerri Nicholas  Director of Air Enforcement  Virginia DEQ Todd Alonzo  Manager   Officer of Air Compliance Coordination  Virginia DEQ  This presentation will provide an overview of air compliance and enforcement activities in recent years around the Commonwealth  We will discuss inspection planning and strategies  regional and central office roles and coordination of cases with EPA    Title TBD Eric Schaeffer  Director  Environmental Integrity Project     Chesapeake Bay Session 1 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay I Moderator Ann Jennings  Virginia Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Stream Monitoring Trends Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission In 2012  HRPDC developed regional recommendations based on Virginia s Phase II Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  including future research and model revisions  policy and funding needs and 18 alternate BMPs that were not included in the Bay model  The presentation will analyze which recommendations were adopted and which have failed to gain acceptance    Prince George s County CBP3 Experience Melissa Cutter  VP   Partnership Development  Corvias Solutions   Chesapeake Bay Track   Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Land Cover Project Phase 6 Land Use Lyndsay Duncan  Project Manager  WorldView Solutions  Inc  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  VDEQ  and the Virginia Geographic Information Network  VGIN  have partnered with WorldView Solutions  Inc  a Richmond based GIS and technology consulting firm  to develop a 1 meter resolution land cover GIS dataset statewide  The final  publically available raster and vector data products will serve as a valuable resource to Virginia localities calculating impervious land area for stormwater management  detecting change related to development  and future land use planning  These land cover products will be sufficiently documented and segmented to support further sub classification by stakeholders seeking additional granularity  Land cover areas developed within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed will serve as Virginia s land use input to the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase 6 suite of modeling tools  This presentation will provide an overview of the specifications and methodologies used in development of the Commonwealth s land cover product    Chesapeake Bay Track   Phase 6 Model Rich Batiuk  Associate Director for Science  Analysis and Implementation  U S

Ph D  University of Virginia   Institute for Environmental Negotiation EPA will be developing expectations for jurisdictions  development of Phase III Watershed Implementation Plans  WIPs  in 2017 2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025  Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners  The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development  evaluation  implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025  This assessment is based on conversations with 122 individuals from federal  state  and local government  the private sector  and non governmental organizations  Because of the interest in learning what helped and what hindered local implementation  a substantial proportion of the conversations occurred with those directly involved with local efforts    Chesapeake Bay Track    Virginia s Locality Outreach Approach for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  Joan Salvati  Manager  Local Government Assistance Programs  Water Division  Virginia DEQ As the jurisdictions within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed begin the planning process for the development of Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  a significant challenge will be to engage local elected officials  local staff and non governmental organizations  NGOs  and enlist their input on identifying pollutant reducing strategies to be used in the Phase III WIP  Virginian is in the process of finalizing a work plan that will lay out a locality outreach approach that includes three phases of the WIP III planning process  education on process and expectations  strategy development  and WIP Drafting  This approach has been based on EPA s Action Plan for Increased Local Partner Engagement and the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment  The outreach approach also builds on DEQ s experience working with local governments on the Phase II WIP and the Chesapeake Bay

Triangle of Resistance  to a Mega Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia    Collaboration in Appalachia  the Clinch River Valley Initiative Frank Dukes  Ph D

Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis

remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Jamie Mitchell  Chief of Technical Services  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept  Dan Holloway  P G  Senior Project Manager Hydrogeologist  CH2M Ed Snyder  P E  B C E E  Vice President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in

Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in

Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South

Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner

trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive

and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake

Effective Environmental Advocacy Moderator TBD   Building a  Triangle of Resistance  to a Mega Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia    Collaboration in

including solar panels  residential wind turbines  geothermal wells  ultra tight walls  windows  and doors  extra insulation  and a sophisticated building management system to reduce power needs and generate all the electricity needed to run the building over the course of a year  The building received LEED Platinum Certification in July  2015 and CBF anticipates the BEC will become the first building in Virginia  and one of 10 buildings internationally to receive Living Building Certification in 2016    Building a Sustainable Pavement System Trenton Clark  Director of Engineering  Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management    VirginiaSAVES Green

Facilities Christopher Mueller  Project Manager  Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development  LID based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County  VA  To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities  they need to be adequately designed  built  inspected  and maintained  The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality  performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life  In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District  the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services  Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division  used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County  All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria  permitted by the county  and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions  As part of the study  existing structural specifications such as ponding depth  facility footprint  soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties  among others  were evaluated  An inventory of the existing plants  comparison with the original planting plan  and the dominant invasive and volunteer plants was prepared  Lack of construction compliance with the original design was one of the main findings of this study  The study makes recommendations on how to improve construction oversight and compliance with the original design at the time of construction    Nutrient Management and MS4

efforts of one University in three areas related to formulating policy and implementing a campus environment that fulfills this vision  In 2009  the GW Office of Sustainability published the GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy based on input from internal and external stakeholders to integrate sustainability into academics  research  practice  and outreach  The Strategy addresses the university s impact and dependence on resource systems on campus  in the Chesapeake Bay eco region  and globally  It provides a framework for specific action plans such as a zero waste plan  climate action plan  and water plan  Currently a cross functional team of faculty  staff  and students are working on Sustainable Landscapes Guidelines  This document will encourage campus planning that addresses the six goals of the Strategy  The Guidelines provide an analysis of the physical condition of the campus landscape as well as social and behavioral aspects of the use of outdoor space by students  faculty  staff and neighbors  The Guidelines build a regenerative design approach for the campus landscape  GW s Square 80 Plaza is a Sustainable Sites Initiative  SITES  certified pilot

resilient landscapes that measure performance in the economic  environmental  and social dimensions of sustainability  Square 80 Plaza is a powerful example of sustainable design  it advances the goals of GW s Ecosystem Enhancement Strategy in measurable ways while providing much needed green open space in a highly urban context  Session 7 Environmental Management Case Studies Moderator TBD   Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling

President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Nissa Dean  Virginia StateDirector  Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay Robert Henry  Executive Director Building Youth for Success Elizabeth Nellums  Manager Chesapeake Bay Programs  National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Accordingto the U S  EPA  stormwater pollution from urban and suburban landscapesaccounts for 15 percent of the nitrogen pollution flowing into the ChesapeakeBay  and it is the only source of pollution in the watershed that is stillincreasing  Costs for treatingstormwater to meet local and regional total maximum daily load or permitrequirements

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in theglobal energy market   NativePlants for Security  Environment and Health KathrynPeterson Lambert  Effortless Language  Planting Culture and Class   The15 minute brief presentation gives an overview

Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator C  Flint Webb  Project Manager  Leidos  Engineering   Technology Solutions Division   Overview of the Climate Action Plan  Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan   Status of Legal Challenges Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator George R  Namie  Senior Air Quality Specialist  Leidos   Overview of Recent Developments  NAAQS  Citizen

Eric Schaeffer  Director  Environmental Integrity Project     Chesapeake Bay Session 1 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay I Moderator Ann Jennings  Virginia Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Stream Monitoring Trends Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission In 2012  HRPDC developed regional recommendations based on Virginia s Phase II Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  including future research and model revisions  policy and funding needs and 18 alternate BMPs that were not included in the Bay model  The presentation will analyze which recommendations were adopted and which have failed to gain acceptance    Prince George s County CBP3 Experience Melissa Cutter  VP   Partnership Development  Corvias Solutions   Chesapeake Bay Track   Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Land Cover Project Phase 6 Land Use Lyndsay Duncan  Project Manager  WorldView Solutions  Inc  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  VDEQ  and the Virginia Geographic Information Network  VGIN  have partnered with WorldView Solutions  Inc  a Richmond based GIS and technology consulting firm  to develop a 1 meter resolution land cover GIS dataset statewide  The final  publically available raster and vector data products will serve as a valuable resource to Virginia localities calculating impervious land area for stormwater management  detecting change related to development  and future land use planning  These land cover products will be sufficiently documented and segmented to support further sub classification by stakeholders seeking additional granularity  Land cover areas developed within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed will serve as Virginia s land use input to the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase 6 suite of modeling tools  This presentation will provide an overview of the specifications and methodologies used in development of the Commonwealth s land

Negotiation EPA will be developing expectations for jurisdictions  development of Phase III Watershed Implementation Plans  WIPs  in 2017 2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025  Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners  The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development  evaluation  implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025  This

Director of Engineering  Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management

Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling

President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in

TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator C  Flint Webb  Project Manager  Leidos  Engineering   Technology Solutions Division   Overview of the Climate Action Plan  Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan   Status of Legal Challenges Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator George R  Namie  Senior Air Quality Specialist  Leidos   Overview of Recent Developments  NAAQS  Citizen Challenges  Aggregation Daniel B  Schulson  J D  Beveridge   Diamond  P C  The panelist will discuss recent developments that have air permitting implications  including those relating to GHGs  and EPA s regulatory actions relating to startup  shutdown and malfunction  SSM SIP call  In addition  the panelist will discuss notable recent court decisions  such as those affecting source aggregation and statute of limitations issues  and how they affect permitting both at the federal and state levels    Air Permitting   A State Perspective Tamera Thompson  Manager  Office of Air Permit Programs  Virginia DEQ VA DEQ s perspective on some of the current air permitting issues  Topics covered will include the incorporation of start up and shutdown requirements in permits as a result of recent EPA lawsuits and EPA s SSM SIP Call  greenhouse gas  GHG  permitting  and trends with Title V fees    Cost Reductions through Predictive Emissions Monitoring Matt Traister  Vice President  O Brien   Gere Session 4 Enforcement of Air Regulations  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Federal Enforcement Trends and Recent Developments and NextGen Enforcement Tools Alec Zacaroli  J D  Haynes and Boone This presentation will focus on EPA s  Next Generation  enforcement initiative  providing an overview of the key principles and policies behind this approach  followed by a particular focus on the empowerment and role of non governmental organizations  including citizens  in the enforcement process  We will look  in particular  at how increased scrutiny by citizen groups and other players could alter the enforcement landscape in coming years    Air Compliance and Enforcement   A State Perspective Kerri Nicholas  Director of Air Enforcement  Virginia DEQ Todd Alonzo  Manager   Officer of Air Compliance Coordination  Virginia DEQ  This presentation will provide an overview of air compliance and enforcement activities in recent years around the Commonwealth  We will discuss inspection planning and strategies  regional and central office roles and coordination of cases with EPA    Title TBD Eric Schaeffer  Director  Environmental Integrity Project     Chesapeake Bay Session 1 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay I Moderator Ann Jennings  Virginia Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Stream Monitoring Trends Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission In 2012  HRPDC developed regional recommendations based on Virginia s Phase II Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  including future research and model revisions  policy and funding needs and 18 alternate BMPs that were not included in the Bay model  The presentation will analyze which recommendations were adopted and which have failed to gain acceptance    Prince George s County CBP3 Experience Melissa Cutter  VP   Partnership Development  Corvias Solutions   Chesapeake Bay Track   Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Land Cover Project Phase 6 Land Use Lyndsay Duncan  Project Manager  WorldView Solutions  Inc  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  VDEQ  and the Virginia Geographic Information Network  VGIN  have partnered with WorldView Solutions  Inc  a Richmond based GIS and technology consulting firm  to develop a 1 meter resolution land cover GIS dataset statewide  The final  publically available raster and vector data products will serve as a valuable resource to Virginia localities calculating impervious land area for stormwater management  detecting change related to development  and future land use planning  These land cover products will be sufficiently documented and segmented to support further sub classification by stakeholders seeking additional granularity  Land cover areas developed within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed will serve as Virginia s land use input to the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase 6 suite of modeling tools  This presentation will provide an overview of the specifications and methodologies used in development of the Commonwealth s land cover product    Chesapeake Bay Track   Phase 6 Model Rich Batiuk  Associate Director

Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment Frank Dukes  Ph D  University of Virginia   Institute for Environmental Negotiation EPA will be developing expectations for jurisdictions  development of Phase III Watershed Implementation Plans  WIPs  in 2017 2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025  Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners  The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development  evaluation  implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025  This assessment is based on conversations with 122 individuals from federal  state  and local government  the private sector  and non governmental organizations  Because of the interest in learning what helped and what hindered local implementation  a substantial proportion of the conversations occurred with those directly involved with local efforts    Chesapeake Bay Track    Virginia s Locality Outreach Approach for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  Joan Salvati  Manager  Local Government Assistance Programs  Water Division  Virginia DEQ As the jurisdictions within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed begin the planning process for the development of Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  a significant challenge will be to engage local elected officials  local staff and non governmental organizations  NGOs  and enlist their input on identifying pollutant reducing strategies to be used in the Phase III WIP  Virginian is in the process of finalizing a work plan that will lay out a locality outreach approach that includes three phases of the WIP III planning process  education on process and expectations  strategy development  and WIP Drafting  This approach has been based on EPA s Action Plan for Increased Local Partner Engagement and the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment  The outreach approach also builds on DEQ s experience working with local governments on the Phase II WIP and the Chesapeake Bay Preservation Act and Stormwater program outreach initiatives  Climate Change Impacts in Virginia Session1 CollaborativeCoastal Virginia Adaptation Solutions Moderator Mary

Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management    VirginiaSAVES Green

Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Jamie Mitchell  Chief of Technical Services  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept  Dan Holloway  P G  Senior Project Manager Hydrogeologist  CH2M Ed Snyder  P E  B C E E  Vice President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in

Session 1  Air Quality and Regulation  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section

Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits

using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney

Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Land Cover Project Phase

Triangle of Resistance  to a Mega Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia    Collaboration in Appalachia  the Clinch River Valley Initiative Frank Dukes  Ph D

building over the course of a year  The building received LEED Platinum Certification in July  2015 and CBF anticipates the BEC will become the first building in Virginia  and one of 10 buildings internationally to receive Living Building Certification in 2016    Building a Sustainable Pavement System Trenton Clark  Director of Engineering  Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT

Session 2 Stormwater Management Case Studies Moderator Ellen Graap Loth  Senior Environmental Scientist  Cardno   Evaluation of Publicly Maintained Bioretention Facilities Christopher Mueller  Project Manager  Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development  LID based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County  VA  To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities  they need to be adequately designed  built  inspected  and maintained  The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality  performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life  In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District  the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services  Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division  used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County  All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria  permitted by the county  and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions  As part of the study  existing structural specifications such as ponding depth  facility footprint  soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties  among others  were evaluated  An inventory of the existing plants  comparison with the original planting plan  and the dominant invasive and volunteer plants was prepared  Lack of construction compliance with the original design was one of the main findings of this study  The study makes recommendations on how to improve construction oversight and compliance with the original design at the time of construction    Nutrient Management and MS4 Compliance at the

efforts of one University in three areas related to formulating policy and implementing a campus environment that fulfills this vision  In 2009  the GW Office of Sustainability published the GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy based on input from internal and external stakeholders to integrate sustainability into academics  research  practice  and outreach  The Strategy addresses the university s impact and dependence on resource systems on campus  in the Chesapeake Bay eco region  and globally  It provides a framework for specific action plans such as a zero waste plan  climate action plan  and water plan  Currently a cross functional team of faculty  staff  and students are working on Sustainable Landscapes Guidelines  This document will encourage campus planning that addresses the six goals of the Strategy  The Guidelines provide an analysis of the physical condition of the campus landscape as well as social and behavioral aspects of the use of outdoor space by students  faculty  staff and neighbors  The Guidelines build a regenerative design approach for the campus landscape  GW s Square 80 Plaza is a Sustainable Sites Initiative  SITES  certified pilot

goals of GW s Ecosystem Enhancement Strategy in measurable ways while providing much needed green open space in a highly urban context  Session 7 Environmental Management Case Studies Moderator TBD   Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling

President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in

Quality Regulation and Policy Session 1  Air Quality and Regulation  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and the Clean Power Plan  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator C  Flint Webb  Project Manager  Leidos  Engineering   Technology Solutions Division   Overview of the Climate Action Plan  Paris Meeting and Clean Power Plan   Status of Legal Challenges Will Cleveland  Staff Attorney  Southern Environmental Law Center   Virginia s Compliance with the Clean Power Plan Dawone Robinson  Virginia Policy Director  Chesapeake Climate Action Network The Environmental Protection Agency has finalized new regulations to limit carbon emissions from the U S  power sector  The Clean Power Plan requires Virginia to submit a suitable state plan that meets new federal targets designed to curb carbon emissions which leads to climate change  The panel will provide information regarding Virginia s possible paths to compliance  as well as discuss the implications and benefits implementing the plan will have on consumers  industry  and the environment in the Commonwealth    Trading under the CPP and Impact on Electricity Supply and Demand Francis Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in Coordination with Air and Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator George R  Namie  Senior Air Quality Specialist  Leidos   Overview of Recent Developments  NAAQS  Citizen Challenges  Aggregation Daniel B  Schulson  J D  Beveridge   Diamond  P C  The panelist will discuss recent

Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay I Moderator Ann Jennings  Virginia Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Stream Monitoring Trends Jeffrey Chanat  Hydrologist  U S  Geological Survey   Chesapeake Bay Progress 2015 James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission In 2012  HRPDC developed regional recommendations based on Virginia s Phase II Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  including future research and model revisions  policy and funding needs and 18 alternate BMPs that were not included in the Bay model  The presentation will analyze which recommendations were adopted and which have failed to gain acceptance    Prince George s County CBP3 Experience Melissa Cutter  VP   Partnership Development  Corvias Solutions   Chesapeake Bay Track   Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake Bay Track   Land Cover Project Phase 6 Land Use Lyndsay Duncan  Project Manager  WorldView Solutions  Inc  The Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  VDEQ  and the Virginia Geographic

final  publically available raster and vector data products will serve as a valuable resource to Virginia localities calculating impervious land area for stormwater management  detecting change related to development  and future land use planning  These land cover products will be sufficiently documented and segmented to support further sub classification by stakeholders seeking additional granularity  Land cover areas developed within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed will serve as Virginia s land use input to the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase 6 suite of modeling tools  This presentation will provide an overview of the specifications and methodologies used in development of the Commonwealth s land cover product    Chesapeake Bay Track   Phase 6 Model Rich Batiuk  Associate Director

Watershed Implementation Plans  WIPs  in 2017 2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025  Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners  The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development  evaluation  implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025  This assessment is based on conversations with 122 individuals from federal  state  and local government  the private sector  and non governmental organizations  Because of the interest in learning what helped and what hindered local implementation  a substantial proportion of the conversations occurred with those directly involved with local efforts    Chesapeake Bay Track    Virginia s Locality Outreach Approach for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  Joan Salvati  Manager  Local Government Assistance Programs  Water Division  Virginia DEQ As the jurisdictions within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed begin the planning process for the development of Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  a significant challenge will be to engage local elected officials  local staff and non governmental organizations  NGOs  and enlist their input on identifying pollutant reducing strategies to be used in the Phase III WIP  Virginian is in the process of finalizing a work plan that will lay out a locality outreach approach that includes three phases of the WIP III planning process  education on process and expectations  strategy development  and WIP Drafting  This approach has been based on EPA s Action Plan for Increased Local Partner Engagement and the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment  The outreach approach also builds on DEQ s experience working with local governments on the Phase II WIP

Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management    VirginiaSAVES Green

Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Jamie Mitchell  Chief of Technical Services  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept  Dan Holloway  P G  Senior Project Manager Hydrogeologist  CH2M Ed Snyder  P E  B C E E  Vice President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in

Waste Management Association South Atlantic States Section  Moderator TBD   Virginia Air Quality  Trends  Exposure  and Respiratory Health Impacts James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality    Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Megan H  Berge  J D  Partner  Baker Botts  LLP  National ambient air quality standards form the foundation of most stationary source programs under the Clean Air Act  Due to the statutory schedule for such standards to be revised  and the litigation that typically plagues revisions to those standards  their implementation and the programs that depend on them is constantly changing  This presentation will address implementation issues and legal challenges associated with both the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards  with a particular focus on state obligations to eliminate the interstate transport of relevant pollutants  Session 2 Climate Regulation  Paris  Obama s Climate Action Plan and

Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits  Developments  Trends and Best Practices  Developed in

Virginia DEQ With the establishment of the Chesapeake Bay TMDL in 2010  the Bay Program Partnership also established a framework for assessing implementation and load reduction progress  The framework called for the development of 2 year programmatic milestones and annual reporting of BMP implementation data for simulation using the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model  The resulting Annual Progress loads from the model  along with reported programmatic milestones accomplishments are the measure by which Bay jurisdiction s efforts in achieving the Bay TMDL goals are assessed  This session will present Virginia s model simulated load reduction progress through 2015 and describe the key findings that will help guide adaptive management as the Partnership approaches the 2017 mid point assessment    Progress Assessment   An NGO Perspective Peggy Sanner  Virginia Assistant Director and Senior Attorney  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Session 2 Assessing our Progress in Restoring the Chesapeake Bay II Moderator Andrienne Kotula  Government Affairs and Policy Manager  James River Association   Chesapeake Bay Track   Estuary Monitoring Trends Rebecca Murphy  Assistant Research Scientist  University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science Water quality trends in the Virginia tidal waters of the Chesapeake Bay  including the mainstream and tributaries  will be presented for parameters including chlorophyll a  dissolved oxygen  and nutrients  These trends are being evaluated for significant patterns and changes over time  especially as related to nutrient loads and management actions in the watershed  We will discuss our current work using Generalized Additive Models  GAMs  to link the water quality trends to nutrient loads with consideration of possible nonlinear relationships over time and impacts of physical and climatic forces    Assessment of James River CHLa Criteria Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae    Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James River Estuary  Session 3 Adapting Local Chesapeake Bay Implementation Programs Moderator Ann Swanson  Executive Director  Chesapeake Bay Commission   Regional Phase II WIP Recommendations   Hits and Misses Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water

including future research and model revisions  policy and funding needs and 18 alternate BMPs that were not included in the Bay model  The presentation will analyze which recommendations were adopted and which have failed to gain acceptance    Prince George s County CBP3 Experience Melissa Cutter  VP   Partnership Development  Corvias Solutions   Chesapeake Bay Track   Virginia Conservation Assistance Program Alyson Sappington  District Manager  Thomas Jefferson Soil and Water Conservation District Kevin McLean  VCAP Coordinator  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts Kendall Tyree  Executive Director  Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  is a new program of the Virginia Association of Soil   Water Conservation Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark

Collaboration for Effective Environmental Advocacy Moderator TBD   Building a  Triangle of Resistance  to a Mega Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia

the BEC will become the first building in Virginia  and one of 10 buildings internationally to receive Living Building Certification in 2016    Building a Sustainable Pavement System Trenton Clark  Director of Engineering  Virginia Asphalt Association Each year  Virginia uses over 9 million tons of asphalt concrete to construct  reconstruct  rehabilitate and maintain pavements  To manufacture asphalt concrete  aggregates and asphalt binder are needed  Initially  asphalt concrete was produced using virgin materials obtained from quarries and oil refineries  However  over the last four decades more and more asphalt concrete was produced using recycled asphalt pavement materials  Today  technology exists that allow pavements to be built and maintained using asphalt concrete that is 100  recycled  These technologies and approaches are not only sustainable and environmentally friendly  but are economical and well performing  In addition to 100  recycled materials  new asphalt pavement structures are being used to clean storm water runoff  Following VDOT specifications and accepted hydraulic design procedures  owners can install porous asphalt pavement structures to address water quality and maximize the use of available space  This presentation will introduce new procedures to build sustainable pavements in terms of materials conservation and storm water management

Facilities Christopher Mueller  Project Manager  Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development  LID based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County  VA  To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities  they need to be adequately designed  built  inspected  and maintained  The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality  performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life  In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District  the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services  Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division  used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County  All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria  permitted by the county  and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions  As part of the study  existing structural specifications such as ponding depth  facility footprint  soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties  among others  were evaluated  An inventory of the existing plants  comparison with the original planting plan  and the dominant invasive and volunteer plants was prepared  Lack of construction compliance with the original design was one of the main findings of this study  The study makes recommendations on how to improve construction oversight and compliance with the original design at the time of construction    Nutrient Management and MS4

efforts of one University in three areas related to formulating policy and implementing a campus environment that fulfills this vision  In 2009  the GW Office of Sustainability published the GW Ecosystems Enhancement Strategy based on input from internal and external stakeholders to integrate sustainability into academics  research  practice  and outreach  The Strategy addresses the university s impact and dependence on resource systems on campus  in the Chesapeake Bay eco region  and globally  It provides a framework for specific action plans such as a zero waste plan  climate action plan  and water plan  Currently a cross functional team of faculty  staff  and students are working on Sustainable Landscapes Guidelines  This document will encourage campus planning that addresses the six goals of the Strategy  The Guidelines provide an analysis of the physical condition of the campus landscape as well as social and behavioral aspects of the use of outdoor space by students  faculty  staff and neighbors  The Guidelines build a regenerative design approach for the campus landscape  GW s Square 80 Plaza is a Sustainable Sites Initiative  SITES  certified pilot

resilient landscapes that measure performance in the economic  environmental  and social dimensions of sustainability  Square 80 Plaza is a powerful example of sustainable design  it advances the goals of GW s Ecosystem Enhancement Strategy in measurable ways while providing much needed green open space in a highly urban context  Session 7 Environmental Management Case Studies Moderator TBD   Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets  Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis  Corporate Environmental Programs Specialist  Smithfield Foods  Inc    DMME s Abatement of Acid Mine Drainage Richard Davis  Abandoned Mine Land Projects Coordinator  Virginia DMME The Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy  DMME  vigorously seeks to abate discharges of acid mine drainage  AMD  in the southwest Virginia coalfields  TMDL reports identified AMD as the stressor on two 303d impaired streams in the Powell watershed where DMME has accomplished AMD treatment projects  Black Creek remains impaired although VASCI scores are nearing a delisting number  Stone Creek has been delisted following completion of AMD projects  Reclamation fees paid by the coal industry fund DMME s annual reclamation grant and the agency has been highly successful in partnering to secure additional funds for AMD projects  For integrity  DMME works to secure the passive treatment systems in public ownership  DMME has reserved grant funds for future operation and maintenance costs  Technologies are transferrable to other AMD discharges    Right Sizing Your Remediation in a Performance Based Remediation World Mark MacEwan  Senior Program Director  AECOM AECOM has successfully remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling

President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the aquifer  Mixed Topics Session1 AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Moderator Kristen Hughes Evans  Executive Director  SustainableChesapeake  AddressingCommunity Needs through Stormwater Restoration Nissa Dean  Virginia StateDirector  Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay Robert Henry  Executive Director Building Youth for Success Elizabeth Nellums  Manager Chesapeake Bay Programs  National Fish and Wildlife Foundation Accordingto the U S  EPA  stormwater pollution from urban and suburban landscapesaccounts for 15 percent of the nitrogen pollution flowing into the ChesapeakeBay  and it is the only source of pollution in the watershed that is stillincreasing  Costs for treatingstormwater to meet local and regional total maximum daily load or permitrequirements is high and these investments compete with other high prioritycommunity needs  like economic development   public health  and education  This panel will focus on strategies forimplementing urban stormwater pollution prevention projects that provide directbenefits to the communities in which they are located  Panelists fromenvironmental  youth group  and funder organizations will provide

Aloumouati  James MadisonUniversity Victoria Foster  James MadisonUniversity Alexander Macfarlane  JamesMadison University Algaebiofuels have attracted considerable attention from the U S  Department ofEnergy  DOE  because of their potential to provide clean  renewable fuel thatdoes not interfere with the global food supply  However  the DOE s NationalAlgal Biofuels Technology Roadmap identifies two main problem areas that needto be overcome for algae biofuels to become economically viable  large scalealgae production and efficient algae harvesting  This project focuses on theoptimization of a novel  energy efficient and cost effective algae harvestingmethod  This method was developed through a public private partnership betweenJames Madison University and Wholesome Energy of Edinburgh  VA  This processuses high shear mixing to break down algae cell membranes in the presence of apowerful non polar solvent in order to facilitate migration of oil into thesolvent phase  The algae oil is then purified from the solvent and the solventis recycled back into the extraction process  Through this optimization of theharvesting system  we strive to make algae biofuels more competitive in theglobal energy market   NativePlants for Security  Environment and Health KathrynPeterson Lambert  Effortless Language  Planting Culture and Class   The15 minute brief presentation gives an overview

Hodsoll  SolUnesco   Recent Developments in Methane Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing Activities Christine Ng  Ph D  Ramboll Environ Extracting unconventional natural gas using hydraulic fracturing  or  fracing  has rapidly expanded in the U S  since the 1980s  While much of the public attention has focused on drilling activity in the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia  the Barnett Shale in Texas  the Bakken Shale in North Dakota and Montana  and the Wattenberg field in Colorado  hydraulic fracturing has also occurred in the development of coalbed methane wells in southwest Virginia since the 1950s  The growth of unconventional natural gas development nationwide has raised concerns about releases of methane  a greenhouse gas  to the atmosphere due to venting and leaks  USEPA has estimated a national average leak rate of 1 5  of total production  Recent proposed and new rules at the federal and state level have sought to reduce methane emissions from hydraulic fracturing through improved technology  emission controls  and monitoring  Certain states have led the way in requiring emission reduction measures such as  green completions  and optical gas imaging techniques  which has spurred adoption by other states and by the federal government  This presentation provides an overview for the layperson on how these rules affect emission sources and processes used in hydraulic fracturing and discusses what regulatory developments at the federal level and in nearby states like Pennsylvania and West Virginia might mean for Virginia  Session 3 Air Permits

Dominion University James Blando  Ph D  Old Dominion University Air quality is an important determinant of public health and quality of life  A secondary data analysis was carried out to investigate trends and air quality in Virginia  The analysis included an evaluation of two major air pollution source categories  emission of criteria and hazardous air pollutants  ambient concentrations of criteria pollutants  ozone standard violations and associated meteorology  and hospital admissions for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Virginia  Comparisons were also made to national trends and statistics  Data was gathered from many open reputable on line sources available through various state and federal agencies  Virginia routinely meets 5 of the 6 criteria air pollutant ambient standards  Ozone does continue to represent a challenge for Virginia  as it does for many other states  Potential focus on further production and consumption of renewable energy  improvement in fuel efficiency among SUV s and light trucks  reduction of the metals content in fuels burned by electric utilities  utilization of emissions inspections for automobiles  utilization of vapor recovery systems at gas stations  and continued emphasis on ozone precursors all have the potential to further improve air quality within Virginia  This is important because the very young and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of poor air quality Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for Ozone Plans Ozone Standard  What is New and What is the Plan for

Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and Nutrient Reduction Studies Moderator James Davis Martin  Chesapeake Bay Program Manager  Virginia DEQ   Nutrient reduction strategies for coastal communities in the Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay    Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing Forest Retention in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed  Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways  Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie Davenport  Director  Water Division  Virginia DEQ   Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked according to  strength  of particular combinations to simultaneously achieve both regulatory and user defined selection criteria    Press the Easy Button for MS4 Compliance James Kelly  PE  Michael Baker International Sabu Paul  PE  Ph D  PMP  Michael Baker International Elizabeth Krousel  PE  Michael Baker International David Cotnoir  PE  Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic This presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark

presentation discusses three tools developed to help the Naval Facilities Engineering Command  Mid Atlantic  cost effectively comply with their Virginia MS4 Phase II permit  The first tool  which is GIS based  will help them evaluate and plan for the large number of potential BMPs that could potentially address the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The tool was based on information in the Virginia Phase I and II MS4 permits  as well as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Action Plan Guidance data  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  The second tool  a database developed using Microsoft  Access  provides the NAVFAC Mid Atlantic with easy access to information on all of their existing structural BMPs  Baker is currently developing a third tool  which will streamline the generation of over 100 conceptual designs for BMPs to be implemented at seven installations covered under NAVFAC Mid Atlantic s Regional MS4 permit  The feasibility assessment portion of the tool will determine if there is enough available land and adequate depth for the proposed BMP and whether the BMP can tie into the existing storm sewer system  A cost estimate report will be created based on common material  labor  and equipment needs to construct the type of BMP proposed  The final portion of the conceptual design tool will create a maintenance plan for the proposed BMPs    Bending the Cost Curve for Localities to Implement Expensive Stormwater Retrofits Joe Lerch  Director of Environmental Policy  Virginia Municipal League Local governments in Virginia will be required through Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System  MS4  permits to meet pollution reduction targets as specified in the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  This will entail a rebuilding of existing urban infrastructure that has been estimated in the range of 9 to 11 billion dollars  This is almost ten times the amount that Virginia and its localities have spent to reduce pollution from wastewater treatment plants  Absent significant federal assistance  Virginia lacks either an adequate revenue stream and or debt capacity to implement these retrofits  This presentation will explore options for reducing the costs to Virginia and its local governments to make these expensive retrofits  Session 6 Improving Decision Support Tools Moderator Whitney Katchmark  Principal Water Resources Planner  Hampton Roads Planning District Commission   Chesapeake

Watershed Implementation Plans  WIPs  in 2017 2018 in which they will outline a strategy for implementing practices necessary to meet Bay TMDL allocations by 2025  Many Chesapeake Bay Program partners recognize that Phase III needs more fully to engage local partners  The purpose of this stakeholder assessment was to inform improvements to the WIP development  evaluation  implementation and oversight processes so that the Phase III WIPs create effective plans for implementation through 2025  This assessment is based on conversations with 122 individuals from federal  state  and local government  the private sector  and non governmental organizations  Because of the interest in learning what helped and what hindered local implementation  a substantial proportion of the conversations occurred with those directly involved with local efforts    Chesapeake Bay Track    Virginia s Locality Outreach Approach for the Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  Joan Salvati  Manager  Local Government Assistance Programs  Water Division  Virginia DEQ As the jurisdictions within the Chesapeake Bay Watershed begin the planning process for the development of Chesapeake Bay TMDL Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  III  a significant challenge will be to engage local elected officials  local staff and non governmental organizations  NGOs  and enlist their input on identifying pollutant reducing strategies to be used in the Phase III WIP  Virginian is in the process of finalizing a work plan that will lay out a locality outreach approach that includes three phases of the WIP III planning process  education on process and expectations  strategy development  and WIP Drafting  This approach has been based on EPA s Action Plan for Increased Local Partner Engagement and the Chesapeake Bay Program s Phase III WIP Stakeholder Assessment  The outreach approach also builds on DEQ s experience working with local governments on the Phase II WIP

Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Dr  Paul A  Bukaveckas  Virginia Commonwealth University  Department of Biology  Center for Environmental Studies Determining whether CHLa criteria are protective requires an assessment of threats posed by algal blooms to aquatic life designated uses and the degree to which these threats would be abated if the criteria were attained  Protectiveness may be judged by various approaches which can be broadly delineated as reference based  i e  attaining conditions as would be expected in the absence of the stressor  or in a least impaired state  and effects based  mitigating observed deleterious effects of the stressor  The criteria developed by VADEQ used a reference approach based largely on phytoplankton community attributes  We tested these criteria using an effects based approach to assess their protectiveness  The effects based analysis provided an independent approach for evaluating the reference based criteria  and a basis for quantifying the expected benefits of attaining CHLa criteria in a form directly relevant to stakeholders  The use of an effects based approach also provided a means to consider multiple lines of evidence representing the various mechanisms by which algal blooms adversely affect aquatic life designated uses  These included water quality conditions  pH  dissolved oxygen  water clarity  phytoplankton community attributes  diversity  evenness  multimetric indices  and occurrence of harmful algae Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Problems with James River Algae blooms extend beyond Dead Zones Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation Joe Wood  Virginia Staff Scientist  Chesapeake Bay Foundation As result of substantial increases in nutrient loads due to anthropogenic forces  the James River Estuary has become a very degraded  eutrophic system  This system experiences depleted levels of dissolved oxygen  DO  due to algal blooms  which have been well documented  However  this impact is not the only problematic consequence of enhanced algal blooms associated with nutrient pollution  The James also experiences Harmful Algal Blooms  HABs  which have the capacity to produce carcinogenic toxins and threaten fisheries and wildlife  Algal blooms can lead to other issues as well such as reduced water clarity  toxic pH levels  and degraded food quality for aquatic food webs  This scientific study and the use of chlorophyll criteria provide an opportunity to inform stakeholders and improve environmental quality of the James

Districts focusing on urban gaps identified in Virginia s Watershed Implementation Plan  VCAP provides financial reimbursement to property owners installing specific conservation practices  A plan is first proposed to the District  after which a site visit verifies the projects eligibility  and with approval installation can begin  These practices can be installed in small acreage settings  at the source of stormwater discharges  All non agricultural property owners in the identified districts are eligible to apply   residential  business  public  and private  The Virginia Conservation Assistance Program  VCAP  created three years ago by four SWCDs operating under the umbrella of the VASWCD urban committee  began the pilot program to address WIP needs  The VASWCD continues to expand the existing VCAP program now providing funding and assistance to all conservation districts wholly or partially in the Chesapeake Bay watershed   Session 4 Protecting the Bay  Forest Retention and

Chesapeake Bay Kendall Effler  James Madison University Kendall Effler  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Thomas Kaisen  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University Jesse McWilliams  James Madison University The project aims to propose a wastewater treatment system focusing on a tertiary treatment system to reduce nutrients for the coastal region of Bluff Point in Northumberland County  Virginia  The nutrients to be reduced are nitrogen and phosphorus in the forms of ammonia and phosphates  These nutrients reduce the dissolved oxygen in the Bay waters and affects the aquatic ecosystems  Local economies depend on the Chesapeake Bay for a large source of income  Improving the water quality of the Bay can assist in maintaining these economies  Septic tank effluent is a cause of nutrient loading to the Chesapeake Bay  Septic tank effluent containing nitrogen and phosphorus enter drainage fields where they can enter the Bay waters thorough infiltration to groundwater or in runoff  Due to Northumberland County s proximity to the Chesapeake Bay  it is important that the effluent of the treated wastewater does not increase the nutrient concentrations of the Bay waters  Nutrient emissions from septic tank effluent were evaluated for a coastal community in Northumberland County and small scale nutrient reduction methods were successfully conducted in a lab setting  The adoption of a sustainable  cost effective wastewater treatment plant may be suitable for replacing septic tanks in Northumberland County  A tertiary system may be a sustainable solution for decreasing nitrogen and phosphorus entering the Chesapeake Bay and subsequently improving the health and water quality of the Bay Chesapeake Bay Track    Valuing

Mark Bryer  Chesapeake Bay Program Director  The Nature Conservancy The sustained health of the Chesapeake Bay and its rivers depends on actions that both restore and protect water quality  A recently completed study  led by the Virginia Department of Forestry  examined how forest conservation could help meet the Bay s Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  The results were stark  nearly 3 million pounds of new pollution could be avoided and over  120 million could be saved in the Rappahannock study area alone if additional provisions to protect forests are put in place  A second phase of this study is being initiated to build local consensus on policies  practices and incentives that can stimulate the retention of forestland  It will also build a  Commonwealth to Commonwealth  peer exchange between Virginia and Pennsylvania to replicate the experience from the Rappahannock in a central Pennsylvania watershed  Both studies are informing broader policy options that can help states and localities meet their clean water goals in more cost effective ways Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Session 5 Innovating Local Stormwater Management Efforts Moderator Melanie

Reduction Method Optimizing Stormwater BMP Selection for Compliance with Virginia s Runoff Reduction Method Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Clayton Hodges  PE  Virginia Tech Recent changes to stormwater regulations in the Commonwealth focusing on a more sustainable approach to management strategies led to the development of the Virginia Runoff Reduction Method  VRRM  which provides a system for nutrient and runoff reduction tracking based on established removal efficiencies through distributed stormwater management networks  treatment trains  Although the VRRM method provides a significant design tool for engineers  complexity of integrated designs and a tendency for designers to use familiar treatment devices can yield sub optimal results when attempting to select the best management practice  BMP  treatment combinations for individual sites  Optimization of BMP selection requires an unbiased approach to compare and evaluate suitable candidate BMPs or BMP combinations based on defined site constraints and other pertinent selection criteria  Virginia Tech  with support by the Virginia Department of Transportation  VDOT  has developed software integrating VRRM treatment train calculation procedures with optimization algorithms to aid in BMP selection  Optimization algorithms in the software utilize a combination of physical site data  drainage areas  site constraints  etc  and user rankings of selection criterion  aesthetics  cost  etc  to cycle through logical combinations of BMPs meeting pollutant removal thresholds for the site  Output is ranked

Natural Gas Pipeline Anita Puckett  Ph D  Preserve Montgomery County  Virginia The proposed construction of the Mountain Valley Pipeline  MVP  which is a 330 mile 42  diameter mega natural gas pipeline to transmit hydrofracked natural gas from northern West Virginia to Pittsylvania County  Virginia  poses to be critically destructive of over 100 000 acres of environmental resources  These include  but are not limited to  endangered and threatened aquatic  faunal  and floral species through deforestation  forest fragmentation  stream sedimentation  and subterranean water pollution  as well as noise  air  and light pollution via compressor stations and pipe leakage  Virginia s Department of Environmental Quality has indicated it will not be offering oversight to the construction and maintenance of this pipeline due to lack of resources  This presentation will discuss environmental protection activities by interstate grassroots citizen groups  working with regional and national environmental organizations  to protect these resources in the face of strong legal and federal regulatory support for the pipeline by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and by existing natural gas laws benefitting MVP  The presentation includes how these efforts are producing a model for resistance using a three pronged approach that involves integrated scientific  federal  state  and local political interventions  and mobilization of citizens and environmental organizations at the local  regional  national  and international levels  This model may have applications to other organizations facing similar challenges for environmental preservation in Virginia    Collaboration in Appalachia  the Clinch River Valley Initiative Frank Dukes  Ph D  University of Virginia

Service Provider Jessica Owen  GIS Technician  Marstel Day LLC Marstel Day  LLC is a socially and environmentally progressive company that is deeply committed to integrating green practices into the company s projects and operations  To develop and implement a robust  company wide culture of sustainability and green practices  in 2008 we created a Green Vision Council  GVC  which has enabled us to implement a comprehensive arc of environmental stewardship initiatives  We believe that the GVC framework is both cost effective and replicable by other companies and organizations  Key GVC attributes are   1  company employees volunteer to take responsibility to carry out internal green initiatives   2  employees rotate off the committee every 6 months and new staff members join   3  all offices are involved   including Fredericksburg  Richmond  and Alexandria  Virginia  and  4  the GVC includes employees from all aspects of company operations   Projects  IT  HR  supply and purchasing   thereby ensuring cross functionality and representation    Beyond Compliance  A Review of Virginia Environmental Success Stories Morgan Goodman  Environmental Specialist  Virginia DEQ Business operations in Virginia can have significant environmental impacts  but how can they go beyond regulatory compliance and why would they choose to  DEQ s Office of Pollution Prevention  P2  has a unique perspective on what it takes to be a success story and the benefits of doing so  P2 staff has seen firsthand how many approaches there are to implementing environmental programs and what underlying factors are indicators of success  Incorporating information from the Virginia Environmental Excellence Program  VEEP  Governor s Environmental Excellence Awards  and P2 Case Studies  key program factors for strengthening environmental management were identified  When a strong environmental program is in place  businesses can manage environmental risks  reduce costs  participate in voluntary programs  and engage stakeholders  Staff  community members  and regulators recognize businesses that are motivated to go beyond regulatory compliance    Engaging Businesses through Businesses for the Bay Corinne Stephens  Business Partnerships Manager  Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay  Businesses can play a critical role in protecting and restoring the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed  Businesses for the Bay  a partnership of the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and the business community  is a membership association providing the Chesapeake business community with a unique opportunity to network  be recognized  and motivate employees  The mission of Businesses for the Bay is to encourage businesses  both large and small  to find voluntary  innovative  and measurable solutions to improve water quality and the health of the Chesapeake Bay  and to raise public understanding of the valuable role these business members play in the Bay restoration  In 2014 and 2015  the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay held the first Chesapeake Business Forums to open a dialogue with businesses across the Chesapeake Bay watershed and inform design of the new Businesses for the Bay program  My presentation will discuss the findings from these Chesapeake Business Forums and present the new Businesses for the Bay program  including actions that businesses can take to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay watershed  and the benefits and details of Businesses for the Bay membership and sponsorship  Session 2 Stormwater Management Case Studies Moderator Ellen Graap Loth  Senior Environmental Scientist  Cardno   Evaluation of Publicly Maintained Bioretention Facilities Christopher Mueller  Project Manager  Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development  LID based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County  VA  To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities  they need to be adequately designed  built  inspected  and maintained  The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality  performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life  In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District  the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services  Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division  used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County  All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria  permitted by the county  and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions  As part of the study  existing structural specifications such as ponding depth  facility footprint  soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties  among others  were evaluated  An inventory of the existing plants  comparison with the original planting plan  and the dominant invasive and volunteer plants was prepared  Lack of construction compliance with the original design was one of the main findings of this study  The study makes recommendations on how to improve construction oversight and compliance with the original design at the time of construction    Nutrient Management and MS4 Compliance at the Northern Virginia Community Colleges Sara Rilveria  Landscape Architect  EEE Consulting  Inc  Stacey Moulds  Senior Environmental Scientist  Obsidian  Inc  Northern Virginia Community College  NOVA  offers a quality and convenient educational experience at an affordable price  Four of the NOVA campuses  Alexandria  Annandale  Loudoun and Woodbridge  have a Phase II General Permit for the Discharge of Stormwater from Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer Systems  MS4  NOVA implements an MS4 Program Plan that includes best management practices  BMPs  to address six minimum control measures  MCMs  and special conditions for the Total Maximum Daily Loads  TMDLs  where NOVA has been assigned a wasteload allocation  WLA  including the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The Chesapeake Bay TMDL and the Virginia Phase I Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  requires  that all state agencies  state colleges and universities    that own land upon which fertilizer  manure  sewage sludge or other compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus are applied to support agricultural  turf  plant growth  or other uses shall develop and implement a nutrient management plan  NMP  for such land  DEQ issued a new MS4 General Permit on July 1  2013 that requires MS4 operators to develop NMPs where nutrients are applied to a contiguous area greater than one acre  NOVA recently updated their NMP s for each campus based on the Virginia DCR Virginia Nutrient Management Standards and Criteria  Revised July 2014  Based on the soil test results  current turf conditions  the intensity of use  and overall visibility and aesthetic considerations  Nutrient Management Areas  NMA  at each campus were established  The number of nutrient management areas was kept to a minimum to facilitate effective management and still protect water quality and maintain healthy turf  The NMPs included detailed maps and recommendations for the NMAs at each campus including a general description of the condition of each area  the size of the area  annual nitrogen  N  phosphorous  P  and potassium  K  fertilization recommendations  and general liming considerations  Like most public facilities the campuses have turf areas where there is ineffective groundcover  including turfgrass  Areas where there is ineffective groundcover have been temporarily removed from active nutrient management until such time as corrective measures can be completed to either establish suitable turf or implement other landscape solutions  groundcovers  hardscape  etc  Session 3 UAV Flight Demonstration Moderator Harry Gregori  President  Gregori Consulting  LLC

participants regarding UAV capabilities  the regulatory environment  and discuss the future of UAVs  Videos will be utilized to demonstrate examples of UAV applications  NOTE  An associated session is proposed for flight demonstration at a separate time and location  Scope of Work Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  UAV  provides significant opportunities to monitor environmental resources  assets and reduce risk  The current regulatory environment has caused confusion within the UAV  air  and UV  unmanned vehicle   air  water  land  communities  This session will inform participants of the current state of UAV operations and management  distinguish operations  Operational Sectors  associated with high level predatory type vehicles  military focus  the hobbyist  and focus on applications for units of government  business and industry  Geographic Orientation The focus of the presentation will be on opportunities in Virginia  Problem Solving Approach Information regarding UAV  aka Drones  is not consistent across Operational Sectors with much of the media focus on military operations and the unfortunate hobbyist miscalculations  Two respected experts in Virginia will present information based

space in a highly urban context  Session 7 Environmental Management Case Studies Moderator TBD   Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc  Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years    An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc  Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment  Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Moderator TBD   Electrokinetic Remediation Technology for Soil Contaminated by E Waste Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011  The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology  The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted    Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly

Environmental Scientist  Cardno   Evaluation of Publicly Maintained Bioretention Facilities Christopher Mueller  Project Manager  Fairfax County Stormwater Management Division Bioretention is one of the most widely used Low Impact Development  LID based stormwater management practices in Fairfax County  VA  To ensure the optimum performance of these facilities  they need to be adequately designed  built  inspected  and maintained  The purpose of this study was to develop a protocol to assess the construction quality  performance and maintenance state of bioretention facilities early on in their functional life  In partnership with the Northern Virginia Soil and Water Conservation District  the Fairfax County Department of Public Works and Environmental Services  Maintenance and Stormwater Management Division  used the protocol to evaluate 90 publicly maintained bioretention facilities in Fairfax County  All facilities were designed according to local and state design criteria  permitted by the county  and receive credit towards mandatory pollutant reductions  As part of the study  existing structural specifications such as ponding depth  facility footprint  soil media depth and soil media hydrodynamic properties  among others  were evaluated  An inventory of the existing plants  comparison with the original planting plan  and the dominant invasive and

NOVA implements an MS4 Program Plan that includes best management practices  BMPs  to address six minimum control measures  MCMs  and special conditions for the Total Maximum Daily Loads  TMDLs  where NOVA has been assigned a wasteload allocation  WLA  including the Chesapeake Bay TMDL  The Chesapeake Bay TMDL and the Virginia Phase I Watershed Implementation Plan  WIP  requires  that all state agencies  state colleges and universities    that own land upon which fertilizer  manure  sewage sludge or other compounds containing nitrogen or phosphorus are applied to support agricultural  turf  plant growth  or other uses shall develop and implement a nutrient management plan  NMP  for such land  DEQ issued a new MS4 General Permit on July 1  2013 that requires MS4 operators to develop NMPs where nutrients are applied to a contiguous area greater than one acre  NOVA recently updated their NMP s for each campus based on the Virginia DCR Virginia Nutrient Management Standards and Criteria  Revised July 2014  Based on the soil test results  current turf conditions  the intensity of use  and overall visibility and aesthetic considerations  Nutrient Management Areas  NMA  at each campus were established  The number of nutrient management areas was kept to a minimum to facilitate effective management and still protect water quality and maintain healthy turf  The NMPs included detailed maps and recommendations for the NMAs at each campus including a general description of the condition of each area  the size of the area  annual nitrogen  N  phosphorous  P  and potassium  K  fertilization recommendations  and general liming considerations  Like most public facilities the campuses have turf areas where there is ineffective groundcover  including turfgrass  Areas where there is ineffective groundcover have been temporarily removed from active nutrient management until such time as corrective measures can be completed to either establish suitable turf or implement other landscape solutions  groundcovers  hardscape  etc  Session 3 UAV Flight Demonstration Moderator Harry Gregori  President  Gregori Consulting  LLC   UAV Flight Demonstration Scott Strimple  CEO

Environmental Management Case Studies Moderator TBD Moderator TBD Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Advantages of Artificial Turf Closure Cap at Louisa County Landfill Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc Richard Brown  P E  Senior Technical Consultant  Joyce Engineering  Inc Louisa County considered several options for capping their 14 acre unlined landfill  The option with the lowest initial cost was a conventional clay cap for  2 1M  The County decided to invest an additional  300 000  14  for an innovative  first in Virginia  structured geomembrane artificial turf  SGAT  cap system which has several long term economic advantages  First  the SGAT system allows an addition 2 0 ft of waste  45 000 cy  to be placed within the permitted airspace limits by eliminating the conventional 18 inch infiltration and 6 inch vegetative support layers at a value of  1 5M  Second  the Owner will save about  100 000 year on maintenance because there will be no mowing  slope erosion repair  or sediment removal from ditch at base of slope  Third  since the closure area side slopes are already lined with 50 mil LLDPE geomembrane  there will be savings on future piggyback expansion lining  The SGAT system components at Louisa include a structured geomembrane barrier with spikes on the lower side to provide frictional resistance with the intermediate cover soil subgrade and studs on the top side to provided stormwater drainage  The artificial turf product installed over the geomembrane is a woven geotextile on the lower side with artificial turf strands on the top side  Concrete sand was spread and brushed into the turf surface to provide ballast  Diversion berms  downslope drainage channels  and stormwater conveyance channels were lined with a sand cement grout to resist erosion from stormwater  Surficial landfill gas is collected in strips installed below the geomembrane and vented through passive gas vents on spacing no greater than one per acre  The end result is an aesthetically pleasing  uniformly green  maintenance free closure cap surface that is warranted for 20 years An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility An Adaptive Management Strategy for Reducing PCBs in Storm Water at a Manufacturing Facility Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc Currie Mixon  Senior Engineer  GEI Consultants  Inc Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB Robert Wallace  Senior Environmental Engineer  ABB PCBs can be ubiquitous in the built environment  Due to their chemical stability and tendency to sorb  PCBs have a strong tendency to bioaccumulate  Hence  risk based water quality criteria related to these compounds tend to be very low  Specifically  water quality criteria can be  close to method detection limits   in units of picograms per liter  which are six to nine orders of magnitude lower than other common pollutants in storm water  These issues make this class of compounds particularly difficult to mitigate economically and effectively  We are presenting the framework for a systematic approach to prioritize and address PCB storm water discharges at a manufacturing facility  The first component of this approach is to develop a conceptual site model  CSM  that allows for identifying the contaminant transport and potential stormwater pathways  An effective CSM aids in cost benefit analysis of targeted best management practices  BMPs  which will provide the largest reductions for the lowest cost  Future work will compare the anticipated reductions in the pollutants with the costs for implementing the BMPs such that projects can be initially prioritized  As projects are completed  monitoring results from the storm water outfalls will allow the team to implement adaptive management practices by evaluating performance of various BMPs to target technologies that provide the largest reductions while seeking to avoid diminishing returns on investment   Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling Session 8 Environmental Management  Electronics Recycling

University Jillian Leary  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Maryam Ekbatani  James Madison University Electronic waste  e waste  is becoming one of the most rapidly growing environmental issues in the world  Widmer  2007  Hester et al  2008  This waste is often composed of both heavy metals and toxic organic matter  To avoid costly recycling methods at the end of the lifetime of an electronic device  manufacturers and consumers often times irresponsibly dump the waste  In 2007  it was found that approximately 80  of e waste disposed of yearly eventually makes its way to a landfill  despite the presence of a landfill s protective lining  contaminants may still leach to the surrounding areas  Wong  2007  As a result of this  heavy metals such as lead  cadmium  chromium  nickel  plutonium  arsenic and uranium are deposited into the soil  In addition  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  PAHs  make their way into the soil  Reddy et al  2004  The aforementioned chemical species have the potential to leak into and contaminate water supplies  as well as cause infertility in soil  This may cause adverse health effects to local human and wildlife upon consumption of the water  Liulin et al  2011 The presences of heavy metals in soil  specifically copper  nickel  and lead  can cause significant damage to the environment and human health as a result of their mobility s and solubility s  The goal of this research is to relate voltage gradient and removal efficiency of Lead  Copper  and Nickel in soil to advance the understanding and application of electrokinetic technology The objective of this project is to investigate the effects of varying voltage gradients on removal efficiency of lead  copper  and nickel in sand and peat soils  A series of experiments with voltage gradients will be conducted Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Responsible Electronics Recycling in Virginia Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis Michael Stegeman  Franchise Development  Securis An average American household currently has 24 electronic devices  In Virginia homes alone  there are 70 million computers  phones  printers  and more   weighing 541 190 000 million pounds  When considering that this number doesn t include electronics used for businesses and government  the amount of equipment out there is staggering  and increasing each year  The United States produces more than 50 million tons of e waste annually  but only a mere 15 percent of that is being responsibly recycled  At the rate that technology is evolving  the amount of electronic devices becoming obsolete will continue to grow  What happens to these devices once they re retired  Realizing this growing need  Securis has been providing secure IT recycling for companies  government agencies  and the community in Northern Virginia for more than 10 years with a 100  guarantee that nothing processed will end up in landfills  Securis recycles millions of pounds of electronics every year and has a client list that includes companies such as General Dynamics  Navy Federal Credit Union  Raytheon  and the Federal Reserve  In 2013  Securis became the first electronic recycling company to successfully franchise their business and now has 7 locations up and down the East Coast ranging from North Carolina to New Jersey  including two in Virginia  Securis also provides monthly electronics recycling events for the community in each location  This presentation will focus on why there are so few electronic devices being properly recycled in Virginia and the United States  We will look at the environmental impacts of not properly disposing electronics and the importance of residents  businesses  and local municipalities choosing a certified  responsible recycler  We ll cover what to look for when choosing an electronics recycler  We will give specific case studies of what Securis does to help organizations and individuals to properly dispose their electronic assets    Virginia Groundwater and Water Resources  Session 1 Remediation Processes to Address Water Quality Moderator Gary Davis

remediated a 4 500 feet long trichloroethene plume at the former Virginia Air National Guard Base in Sandston  Virginia under challenging subsurface conditions using a  right sized  approach  The two keys to properly sizing the groundwater remediation were   1  identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for the differing subsurface site conditions and geochemistry  The remediation strategy was successful in achieving the remediation goals  Session 2 Water Supply Planning Options and Opportunities Moderator Eric Lassalle  Director  Energy Initiatives  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Water Filled Mines and Quarries for Emergency Water Supply William Lassetter  Economic Geology Section Manager  Virginia DMME The Department of Mines  Minerals and Energy estimates there are over 220 active and inactive mines and quarries in Virginia that either currently hold or have the capacity to hold substantial quantities of water that may be tapped during emergency conditions  These conditions may include extended drought  contamination of normal drinking water supplies  the need for hazardous dust control  fire suppression  and other urban water system needs  With steep walls  limited inflow from surface drainages  and a relatively small surface footprint that minimizes evaporation  deep stone quarries and other mine excavations accumulate water mainly from groundwater recharge and rainfall  These impoundments may also serve as temporary storage for excess storm water  The geologic setting is a major factor that determines the relative quality of the impounded water and type of treatment that may be needed prior to beneficial use  A study is presently underway to assess the most important water quality parameters  water balance and storage capacity characteristics  and infrastructure that would be needed for source water protection at 5 water filled mines representing major geologic provinces in Virginia  The key parameters identified in this study will serve as the basic data attributes for a state wide inventory of water filled mines and quarries  Prepared as a web based map service  this inventory is expected to provide a valuable tool for land use planners and emergency responders    Meeting 2018 Compliance Conditions for Local and Regional Water Supply Plans and Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control Technologies  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Protecting Virginia s Water 3 Ways  Pollution Prevention  Reuse and Conservation Jill Rowen  Sales Manager  Griswold Water Systems Cooling towers are usually the most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing ditching and or the filling of ditching  the abiliity to account for topsoil and subsoil characteristics  ability to incorporate overbank flow from adjacent stream systems  an input output report that is suitable for submission to regulatory agencies and inclusion in mitigation plans  The sofware can be used by regulators to check mitigation design and practioners during the design process with the goal of improving the wetland hydrology analysis to ensure a successful mitigation site is created and or restored    Water Conservation Best Practices at a Manufacturing Facility Ruth Debrito  Corporate Environmental Management System Coordinator  Smithfield Foods  Inc  The presentation will focus on looking at ways to save water  and success stories  including water reuse  looping single pass cooling systems and nozzles selection in equipment  The discussion will include water savings in costs  and gallons  It will help to support and implement return on investments for the projects being considered  By sharing successes  trials and ideas  any industry can benefit and help improve the environment  Session 6 Sustainable Water Recycling  Protecting Virginia s Future Moderator Ted Henifin  P E  General Manager  Hampton Roads Sanitation Dept    Sustainable Water Recycling

President  CH2M David Jurgens  City of ChesapeakeThe residents of Hampton Roads send approximately 150 million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and Chesapeake s experiences with treating and returning water to the

Improving Data Collection Tammy Stephenson  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ DEQ is coordinating with all localities in the Commonwealth to more actively manage the Commonwealth s water resources  As such  DEQ would like to ensure that there is understanding of the water supply planning regulation requirements and appreciate the responsibility of local governments to meet compliance conditions  Additionally  DEQ wants to ensure that everyone understands that there is a regulation which requires withdrawals meeting thresholds to annually report these withdrawals  information which assists with better management of Virginia s water resources through improved data  Further  everyone should appreciate that managing water resources for long term sustainability is an effort for which all stakeholders must become aware and involved    The Evolution of Water Resource Management in Virginia Andrea Wortzel  Coordinator   Mission H2O  Troutman Sanders  LLP Virginia recently finalized its State Water Resource Plan  The plan identifies a number of challenges in Virginia  and highlights area where critical water issues are expected in the future  Virginia has also established a collaborative framework for addressing groundwater management in Eastern Virginia  This presentation will highlight how Virginia s approach to water resource management is evolving  and what that means for industrial  agricultural and municipal water users  Session 3 Groundwater Management through Modeling and Permitting Moderator Scott Kudlas  Director  Office of Water Supply  Virginia DEQ   Use of the Regional Groundwater Flow Model for Groundwater Resource Allocation Britt McMillan  Principal Geologist  Arcadis 2014 was a hallmark year for groundwater resource management in Virginia  with the Department of Environmental Quality  DEQ  adopting new Groundwater Withdrawal regulations as well as applying a new groundwater model for resource allocation  Redefining the 80  drawdown criterion in the regulations coupled with changes implemented in the new model has resulted in significantly reducing the amount of groundwater available for permitted use in the Coastal Plain of Virginia  The impetus for these changes was the long standing recognition that permitted groundwater withdrawals are over allocated in the Coastal Plain  if all groundwater users pumped at their full permitted rights  there would likely be significant impacts to the groundwater resource  Under the new regulatory definitions and use of the new groundwater model  DEQ has determined that current permitted withdrawals need to be reduced by about 57 MGD to approach sustainable conditions  However  as will be demonstrated  the changes introduced in 2014 may unnecessarily restrict groundwater use  A reduction in permitted withdrawals substantially less than the current target can still meet a sustainable goal  The original 80  drawdown criterion was based on the amount of groundwater above the top of the aquifer available for drawdown  requiring 20  remain available to protect from aquifer dewatering  While the new definition simplified calculation of the 80  criterion  it disconnected the criterion from a relatable groundwater availability metric  This results in creation of  critical areas  that never met and can never meet the criterion  The new groundwater model is a significant improvement over the original model used for resource allocation  While model calibration has demonstrated the improved accuracy  the added use of the Hydrogeologic Unit Flow  HUF  approach to assess withdrawal impacts now over predict drawdown by over 35 feet in some areas in both the thick Potomac and overlying thinner aquifers  where less than one foot of change can define an acceptable withdrawal  Several easily implemented approaches will be outlined that can correct the over predicted impacts that unnecessarily restrict withdrawals while maintaining a sustainable groundwater resource    Facilitating Change Through GW Withdrawal Permitting in VA s Coastal Plain Craig Nicol  Program Manager  Virginia DEQ For the Commonwealth to successfully manage groundwater resources in the Coastal Plain  all Virginians must recognize their role as active stakeholders in identifying and solving groundwater issues  Resource issues present challenges  but with a shift in perspective  they can also provide motivation for increased stakeholder participation along the path to better outcome  With greater collaboration  flexibility  and creativity  we can jointly create practical solutions and achievable improvements to the state of groundwater within Virginia    Managing Coastal Plain GW  An Innovative Solution to Understand Unregulated Water Use Curt Thomas  Program Coordinator  Virginia DEQ Virginia continues to experience declining groundwater levels due to the extensive demand on its aquifer system in the Coastal Plain  While DEQ monitors permitted water use  a large portion of unregulated water use  mainly private residential wells  remained unknown  Understanding unregulated water use is important so that groundwater level gains from permitted reductions are not compromised due to growth in the private sector  Thus  DEQ  VDH  and the well drilling community collaborated to find a mutually beneficial solution to address this missing piece of water data  DEQ and VDH used stakeholder feedback from the well drilling community to complete two major initiatives   1  created a joint  GW 2 Unified Water Well Completion Report and  2  developed an online registration platform for well submissions to both agencies  The online well submission process is designed to add value for well drillers affected by the new regulation  improve coordination between two state agencies with common goals  and improve data collection of unregulated water use to better manage Virginia s water resources  Session 4 Groundwater Best Practices and Geology Moderator Bill Gill  AVP Environmental Affairs  Smithfield Foods  Inc    Reducing Bacteria Contamination through Best Management Practices in a Virginia Watershed Ram Gupta  Ph D  Virginia DEQ Water resource agencies have identified the need to evaluate and inform the public on the impact of implementing best management practices  BMPs  on water quality status  Bacteria are identified as a common contamination source in surface waters  across the Commonwealth  Implementing various BMPs in the Carter Run watershed has shown significant reductions in pollutant loading and a decline in bacteria criterion violation rates  The Carter Run watershed  located in Fauquier County  Virginia  is a part of the Upper Rappahannock River Basin in the Chesapeake Bay watershed  The watershed  approximately 35 580 acres  is comprised of forest  63  agricultural  35  and residential  2  land uses  A portion of Carter Run was placed on the Commonwealth of Virginia s impaired waters list in 1998 due to violation of State s water quality standards for fecal coliform  A bacteria Total Maximum Daily Load  TMDL  for Carter Run was completed in 2005  An implementation plan developed with input from stakeholders and government agencies  led to initiation of an implementation project in 2006 in the Carter Run watershed  BMP implementation has resulted in a considerable number of agricultural and residential BMPs being installed from 2007 through 2015  These BMPs include   i  agricultural practices   290 326 linear feet  55 miles  of livestock stream exclusion fencing  198 acres of riparian buffer  93 acres of harvestable cover crops and 81 acres of permanent vegetative cover on cropland  and  ii  residential practices   95 septic tank system pump outs  28 septic system repairs  and seven septic system installations or replacements  These BMPs have resulted in significant reductions in bacteria  nitrogen  phosphorous and sediment loadings  The water quality data collected from 2003 through 2015 at a long term trend monitoring station in the watershed indicates a significant decrease in violation rate of the E  coli single sample maximum criterion  The project demonstrates positive impacts from watershed based planning  commitment of long term funding  and a partnership between government agencies  local stakeholders and landowners to implement conservation practices and improve land use management and local water quality conditions    Geologic controls on sinkholes in the Virginia Valley and Ridge Matthew Heller  Geology Manager  Virginia DMME Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for ground water recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  An analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented    Developing a Groundwater Remediation Strategy for Industrial Facilities in Karst Mike Hall  PG  Senior Managing Scientist  O Brien   Gere Developing a remedial strategy in karst is difficult enough  developing one at an active industrial site adds another layer of complexity  The presentation will address some of the significant challenges  and provide recommendations for how to develop a successful remediation strategy to overcome them  A successful strategy in karst is often far different from the strategy typically applied at a more conventional site  The presentation will provide lessons learned from work at industrial facilities at a variety of locations in karst  Session 5 Water Conservation Case Studies Moderator Keith Bailey  Director  Environmental Control

most efficient and environmentally responsible way to dump heat from a building or process  They are also prime for improving the overall sustainability of a building  Eliminating chemicals from the water treatment process prevents these pollutants from entering the air and discharge water  Chemical free discharge water can bypass an overloaded waste water treatment plant  and be reused for such purposes as landscaping and toilet flushing  Finally  system improvements can allow up to 25  reduction in the potable water used to operate the tower    A New Wetlands Water Budget Model Michael Rolband  President  Wetland Studies and Solutions  Inc  Many wetlands restoration and creation failures occur due to hydrology issues  An improved water budget methodology could reduce this failure rate  Three water budget modeling methods dominate current industry practices  The most commonly used water budget model in industry practice in Virginia is the  Pierce Method  While this method has resulted in numerous successful mitigation projects  areas of improvement have been noted  Specifically  it cannot model all sloped wetlands  it does not account for extremely high roughness and resulting very slow flow of a water through a wetlands system at low water depths  the soil characteristic parameter is limited to a permeability assumption  other soil characteristics are not accounted for  groundwater driven systems can be modeled to a very limited degree  with a Type II rainfall distribution  the volume of run off may be overestimated  and the general reliance of this approach on developing a dense and impermeable base layer often runs counter to soil reconstruction and plant rooting needs  which frequently leads to the development of perched hydrologic conditions that are quite different from the more typical endoaquic conditions common to many impact sites  The scope of our work was to develop the first water budget model that combines the best facets of all known models and create a windows based computer program that is user friendly with an instruction manual  Called WetBud  this software will include a library of historic rainfall data for all NOAA stations in Virginia and designation of which years should be selected as  dry   typical  and  wet  modeling of sloped wetlands  modeling of groundwater inflows  the ability to account for existing

million gallons of water to Hampton Roads Sanitation District  HRSD  each day  HRSD cleans this water to exacting standards and returns it safely to area waterways  The cost to clean water is rising as new regulatory requirements are implemented to address current and future environmental goals  HRSD has long sought more sustainable uses for the valuable clean water it produces  To that end  HRSD commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of applying additional treatment processes to the water HRSD currently returns to the environment to bring it to levels that exceed drinking water quality  then using that water to meet the groundwater supply needs of current and future generations throughout eastern Virginia  Groundwater in eastern Virginia is currently being utilized at an unsustainable rate  jeopardizing not only continued water supply but also contributing to land subsidence and saltwater contamination of the aquifer  HRSD modeled the effect of pumping 120 million gallons of drinking quality water daily into the Potomac aquifer at several HRSD plant locations in southeastern Virginia  The results show a positive impact on nearly the entire Potomac aquifer  increasing pressures west to the Fall Zone  as far north as Maryland and south beyond the North Carolina border  The increased pressure along the coast would also inhibit salt water contamination and could slow or even reverse land subsidence  The modeled increase in water supply can support all existing permits for groundwater use  with capacity to allow future withdrawals practically anywhere within the Eastern Virginia Groundwater Management Area  The advanced cleaning processes to be used by HRSD to exceed drinking water standards will produce water that both protects human health and closely matches the chemistry of the water already in the aquifer  Treating water to match aquifer chemistry has been done successfully for decades throughout the world  and since the late 1980s at Southeast Virginia s Chesapeake Aquifer Storage and Recovery facility  Representatives from HRSD and the City of Chesapeake will be present to discuss HRSD s sustainable water recycling initiative and

identify and remove the source  and  2  understand the subsurface conditions so that time and money was not wasted remediating  clean  groundwater  A multi tiered approach was used to treat the site including source removal  recirculation with a hydrogen release compound and pH buffering  and in situ injections of  zero valent iron and or electron donor  carbon  sources specifically tailored for
