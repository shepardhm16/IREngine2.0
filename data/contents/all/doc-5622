LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  1  2011    The student veterans are coming  Are you ready  This question will be addressed in a one day conference   We Are Virginia Veterans on Campus  for college administrators and the increasing number of student veterans they serve  The conference will run from 9 a m  to 5 p m  Aug  9 at the Virginia Military Institute s Center for Leadership and Ethics  located in Marshall Hall on the VMI post  Registration will begin at 8  Sponsored by the Virginia Wounded Warrior Program of the Virginia Department of Veterans Services  the conference will make deans of students  college counselors  advisers  registrars  and medical staff  and administrators in financial aid  admissions  and disability services more aware of the needs of student veterans  It will also offer training on how to meet those needs   The new Post 9 11 GI Bill benefits are the most generous educational support for veterans since the original GI Bill after World War II  said Catherine Wilson  executive director of the Virginia Wounded Warrior Program   Veteran enrollments in our colleges and universities  including community colleges  are expected to rise markedly  It can be difficult for these student veterans to navigate through a complex and unfamiliar bureaucracy to receive the benefits  noted Capt  Susan Rabern  director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics   These student veterans made a sacrifice for their country  said Rabern  who recalled the dogged persistence required of her when she used her GI Bill benefits to earn her doctorate   They re more mature than the typical college student  These are people who have served and who deserve to be served in return   If you re not determined and fully cognizant  you re not going to get through  added Maj  Amy Dehart  the Center s acting deputy director   This conference is about removing the barriers  The keynote address   Honoring Our Veterans  will be given by retired Marine Corps Maj  Gen  Christopher Cortez  general manager for strategic operations at Microsoft Public Sector  Americas and Asia  Cortez leads Microsoft s Military 2 Microsoft Program  also called  We Still Serve  The program assists transitioning veterans with managing the challenges of navigating the private sector job market  The morning sessions will include a student veteran panel discussion   From the Front Lines to the Classroom  Four veterans who returned from active duty to pursue undergraduate or graduate studies will speak about their experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan and the challenges of becoming students in an environment geared toward those transitioning from high school rather than from combat  Three afternoon presentations will offer practical information on making colleges and universities veteran friendly  helping veteran students make the most of the higher education experience  and ensuring their health and resilience  Closing remarks will be given by Paul Galanti  commissioner of the Department of Veterans Services and member of VMI s Board of Visitors   After World War II  the nation opened its arms to veterans  but I m not so sure the current system of colleges and universities has had to opportunity to see it that same way  said Rabern   Reducing the barriers for student veterans is good for the veterans  added DeHart   It s good for the colleges  who need paying students  and it s good for the nation  The registration fee is  35 for non students and  15 for students  To pre register or for more information about the conference  visit
