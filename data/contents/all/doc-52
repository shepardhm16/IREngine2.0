Academic Catalogue  ARCHIVED CATALOG  Biology Print Friendly Page The mission of the VMI biology department is to broadly train students to understand how living organisms function and to appreciate the intricacies and interactions that govern all living systems  This mission supports the broader VMI mission of creating citizen soldiers  by equipping students to make informed decisions that will better society  We accomplish this by providing students with broad training and a fundamental background in the biological sciences  while providing the opportunity to specialize in the subdisciplines described under  Academic Concentrations in Biology  In addition  attainment of teacher certification is possible  The degree programs are particularly good at preparing majors to pursue post graduate education in the biological and health sciences and allow for specialization that matches student interests and career plans  Faculty members believe that interaction with cadets in the classroom  laboratory  and on an individual basis is critical in the development of the successful biology major  In keeping with this philosophy  class sizes are small  laboratories accompany most courses  advising is conducted on an individual basis  and undergraduate research is encouraged  The biology department also provides a summer research experience  The Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program is an intensive  ten week program that introduces selected students to the scientific method  research design and data analysis  data presentation  use of sophisticated laboratory instruments  and independent research  Each student conducts a research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor  This research is at the  cutting edge  of science  and student faculty publications have resulted from these projects  Normally  cadets are selected to participate in this program between their second and first class years  Many additional opportunities for undergraduate research exist  allowing students to engage in a one on one interaction with a faculty mentor in their area of interest as early as the summer following the fourth class  freshman  year  Capstone Experiences in Undergraduate Research Requirement  3 credits  Recognizing that many of our students already engage in a comprehensive research experience that requires them to apply  integrate  and critically analyze information and data  the biology department requires that this experience be recognized as their Capstone Experience  Successful completion of the Capstone Experience is a graduation requirement  therefore any of the following course sequences will satisfy that requirement  BI 353W BI 354W  Summer Scholars Program  BI 390  BI 391  BI 392W  BI 393W  BI 490W  and BI 491W  Independent Research Courses  BI 401W BI 402W  Senior Honors Thesis  and HN 400 HN 401  Institute Honors  Students must complete two semesters or a full summer of research  SURI  under the guidance of a faculty mentor culminating with a research paper and oral presentation of the data  Those biology students who do not avail themselves of the opportunity to engage in undergraduate research or do so for only one semester will be required to complete BI 420W  Senior Seminar  in order to fulfill the capstone course requirement  Those receiving more than 3 credits for this experience can apply them as research hours credit  Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program The Fred C  Swope Summer Undergraduate Research 38 Virginia Military Institute 12 13 Catalogue Scholar s Program in Biology at the Virginia Military Institute was established in 1991 and in is named after one of VMI s most visionary Biology Department Chairmen  Dr  Fred C  Swope  This two month program is designed to acquaint selected Biology undergraduate students with the philosophy  practices  and techniques of research  During the months of June through July the program engages the students in a research project with a faculty mentor  At the end of the summer students in the program organize a symposium that is presented to reflect the many facets of their undergraduate research training  Students in the program spend their mornings learning about the many skills and philosophies of the practice of science  Students also carry out research projects in the afternoons with a faculty mentor and acquire the ability to make scientific observations  collect and analyze data  and to synthesize this information in a meaningful context  Students are encouraged to continue their research interests into the following academic year and beyond in anticipation of completion of a Department or Institute Honors Thesis  Upon the completion of these undergraduate research experiences the student has acquired a meaningful and in depth knowledge of the research process and has a realistic idea of what is involved in pursuing post graduate studies  The program is funded through a private endowment that provides funds for 5 6 student summer stipends plus room  board  six hours of academic credit  and spending money  Honors in Biology A cadet can earn departmental honors by completing a research project by their 1st class year and presenting the research to the department  Eligibility to apply for departmental honors requires 1st class standing  a minimum cumulative and biology GPA of 3 000  An application in the form of a research proposal is submitted to the department at the end of the 2nd class year or at the beginning of the 1st class year  If the department approves the proposal  then the cadet will enroll in BI 490   independent research in the fall  and then BI 491   independent research in the spring  By the middle of April  a formal research paper will be submitted to the department at least two weeks prior to the oral presentation  defense  The awarding of Honors in Biology will be made following successful completion of the research project and oral defense  Programs
