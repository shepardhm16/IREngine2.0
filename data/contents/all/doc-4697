Renovation of Maury Brooke  Content aspx id 10737429087  p  Cadet Masters the Art of Creating Study Skins   It s rare that students find themselves better off when a class they d hoped to take doesn t fill   but that s exactly what happened to Cadet Alyssa Ford  14 last fall  Ford  a biology major  had done a summer research project with Col  Dick Rowe last year  investigating the nest defense behavior of tree swallows  and she knew she wanted to take another class with him before she graduated  She signed up for Rowe s ornithology class  but then too few cadets enrolled  At that point  Ford recalled  Rowe said to her   I have something better for you  That something better turned out to be an independent study project creating specimens for the department s bird collection  Each Tuesday afternoon  Ford and Rowe work together in the lab as Rowe  a trained ornithologist  shows Ford how to take a dead bird  remove its insides  and mount the hide over cotton batting and a wooden dowel to create a  study skin  that shows what the bird looked like in life  So far this semester  she s worked on male and female cardinals  a mourning dove  a Carolina wren  and a catbird  among others  The finished products will be used as teaching tools so cadets can learn what the birds look like up close  Rowe explained that for such purposes  it s better to have a study skin   because when students are observing birds at a feeder  the birds may fly away before the study is complete  For Ford  the bird project has proven to be a worthwhile learning experience   I didn t know what to expect going into it  said Ford  as she and Rowe worked together on the screech owl one afternoon   It just takes a lot of time and patience  and sometimes an extra hand or two  Rowe said that Ford s interest and timing were ideal   I was looking for a student to do this  because we knew we had all of these birds in the collection  and  Maj  Paul Moosman  and I were just starting to build the natural history collection  he commented  Rowe said that he s been collecting dead birds and storing them in the freezer for the last three to four years  with the hopes of finding a cadet with enough time to devote to the project of turning them into study skins  He has state and federal salvage permits to pick up dead migratory birds  and he also has a number of people who bring him birds they ve found dead  Joking about his sources  Rowe observed   They re sort of embarrassed to be carrying around paper bags with dead birds in them  More seriously  Rowe explained that just like a householder s supply of frozen food  frozen birds don t last forever  The birds are susceptible to freezer burn  which dries their delicate skin and makes it tear more easily  Moosman  who is building a separate collection of mammalian study skins  explained that having a student s work become part of a permanent collection is rare  because of the skill level required to produce an acceptable specimen   What Alyssa is doing is highly unusual in our department  especially  but she s getting so much practice that undoubtedly most of her specimens will be included in the collection  he said   You need someone who s going to get enough experience to get good at it  It s an art  really  Ford  meanwhile  has found the bird project a way to tie together what she s learned from her biology coursework   and it s also helping her complete a concentration in environmental  conservational  and organismal sciences   It s interesting to kind of put everything together  said Ford  adding that she d learned a good bit about the anatomy of birds   I m helping out  the biology department  and I m learning what the birds look like    Mary Price  VMI   p  Julie Sandridge Tue  15 Apr 2014 07 15 05 GMT
