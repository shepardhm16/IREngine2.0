Lockwood McLaughlin  In Environment Virginia Opener  Governor Discusses Climate Change  Jobs in Alternative Energy LEXINGTON  Va  April 8  2014   Addressing environmental concerns will allow Virginia to embrace economic growth from emerging technologies and prepare for the effects of climate change  Gov  Terry McAuliffe told 500 environmental leaders today  McAuliffe  speaking at the opening session of the Environment Virginia Symposium at Virginia Military Institute s Marshall Hall  called for such initiatives as wind farms in the Atlantic and preparing Coastal Virginia for rising sea levels due to a warming planet   We have a lot of work to do  We have made some tremendous progress  but we ve got a long way to go  said McAuliffe in regard to Virginia s environmental plan   If we want to help the environment tomorrow  we have to make smart  common sense decisions today  The conference  organized by VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  attracted more than 650 environmental leaders from the public and private sectors  Thirty five exhibitors are representing state and federal agencies  industries  and non profit organizations at the conference  whose theme is  Collective Impact  Working Together to Create a Positive Environmental Impact   I am very serious about the environment  it s something I talked about through my entire campaign  McAuliffe said at the outset of his address to the capacity crowd in Gillis Theatre  The governor asserted that the first step to ensuring environmental prosperity in the future is to  accept climate change is real   I happen to believe humans contribute to climate change  I think it s pretty much settled  he said  McAuliffe said he is taking steps to prepare Virginia for the effects of climate change  Over the next few months  the Climate Change Commission  which has not convened in four years  will begin to meet again  He noted that Hampton Roads is ranked second in the country for areas most at risk for rising sea levels   We cannot afford to ignore this  we need to prepare our coastal communities  McAuliffe said   In addition to combating our rising sea levels  we need to ensure that our water is clean and safe  McAuliffe continued  He pointed to the recent coal ash spill in the Dan River as evidence that the threat to Virginia s drinking water is real  Key to both the environment and economy will be growing the state s alternative energy jobs   These are the jobs of the future  McAuliffe explained  He also emphasized the importance of making Virginia s children aware of the environment   When they are exposed to the natural beauty of our state  they gain an appreciation for it  McAuliffe said   When they are taught about how each piece of our natural world fits with the rest    our children will grow up to be great stewards of the commonwealth  Illustrating his focus on safeguarding the environment  the governor promised  hundreds of thousands of acres will be put aside for conservation  during his administration   Protected lands will include wetlands  endangered habitats  publicly available hunting and fishing grounds  park land  and special Virginia landmarks like the Natural Bridge  A major milestone of McAuliffe s environmental plan for Virginia calls for the commonwealth to be  60 percent of the way towards a truly clean  Chesapeake  Bay  by 2017  The governor concluded with a positive outlook on Virginia s environment and economy based on the strong start addressing issues during his short time in office   You do have a governor that cares about the environment and is willing to put his shoulder to the wheel to do what we need to do to make sure we are preserving our environment for our children  he said  The conference will continue through Thursday  bringing together leaders and acting as a forum for the exchange of ideas that will promote environmental and economic sustainability in Virginia  Small group sessions will discuss specific issues throughout the conference  Along with VMI  the Virginia departments of Conservation and Recreation and Environmental Quality and the Virginia Environmental Endowment are serving as hosts
