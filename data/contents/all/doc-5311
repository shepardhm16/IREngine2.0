of my official life in announcing to you and through you to the Faculty   Cadets of the Virginia Mil  Institute the death of the great and good the heroic and illustrious Lieut  General T J  Jackson at 15 minutes past 3 oclock yesterday afternoon  This heavy bereavement over which every true heart within the bounds of the Confederacy mourns with inexpressible sorrow must fall if possible with heavier force upon that Noble State Institution to which he came from the battle fields of Mexico  and where he gave to his native state the first years service of his modest and unobtrusive but public spirited and useful life  It would be a senseless waste of words to attempt a eulogy upon this great among the greatest of sons who have immortalized Virginia  To the Corps of Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute  what a legacy he has left you  what an example of all that is good and great and true in the character of a Christian Soldier  The Governor directs that the highest

victory  there is not a home in the Confederacy that will not feel the loss and lament it as a great national calamity  But our loss is distinctive  He was peculiarly our own  He came to us in 1851  a Lieutenant and Brevet Major of Artillery from the army of the late United States  upon the unanimous appointment of the Board of Visitors as Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  and Instructor of Artillery  Here he laboured with scrupulous fidelity for 10 years  in the duties of these important offices  Here he became a soldier of the Cross and as an humble conscientious and

Sir  By Command of the Governor I have this day to perform the most painful duty of my official life in announcing to you and through you to the Faculty   Cadets of the Virginia Mil  Institute the death of the great and good the heroic and illustrious Lieut  General T J  Jackson at 15 minutes past 3 oclock yesterday afternoon  This heavy bereavement over which every true heart within the bounds of the Confederacy mourns with inexpressible sorrow must fall if possible with heavier force upon that Noble State Institution to which he came from the battle fields of Mexico  and where he gave to his native state the first years service of his modest and unobtrusive but public spirited and useful life  It would be a senseless waste of words to attempt a eulogy upon this great among the greatest of sons who have immortalized Virginia  To the Corps of Cadets of the Virginia Military Institute  what a legacy he has left you  what an example of all that is good and great and true in the character of a Christian Soldier  The Governor directs that the highest funeral honors be paid to his memory  that the customary outward badges of mourning be worn by all the officers and cadets of the Institution  By command  W H  Richardson  A G  By Command of Major Genl  Smith  A G  Hill  Actg  Adjt  V M I   Head Quarters Virginia Military Institute May 13th  1863 General Order No  30 It is the painful duty of the Superintendent to announce to the officers and Cadets of this Institution the death of their late associate and Professor Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  He died at Guinea s Station  Caroline Co  Va on the 10th inst of Pneumonia  after a short but violent illness  supervening upon the severe wound received in the battle of Chancellorsville  A nation mourns the loss of Genl  Jackson  First in the heart of the brave men he has so often led to victory  there is not a home in the Confederacy that will not feel the loss and lament it as a great national calamity  But our loss is distinctive  He was peculiarly our own  He came to us in 1851  a Lieutenant and Brevet Major of Artillery from the army of the late United States  upon the unanimous appointment of the Board of Visitors as Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  and Instructor of Artillery  Here he laboured with scrupulous fidelity for 10 years  in the duties of these important offices  Here he became a soldier of the Cross and as an humble conscientious and useful Christian man he established the character which has developed into the world renowned Christian Hero  On the 21st of April 1861 upon the order of his Excellency Governor Letcher  he left the Institute  in command of the Corps of Cadets for Camp Lee  Richmond  for service in the defense of his state and country and he has never known a day of rest until called by Divine command to cease from his labors  The military career of Genl  Jackson fills the most brilliant and momentous page in the history of our country and on the achievements of our arms  and he stands forth a colossal figure in this war for our Independence  His country now returns him to us not as he was when he left us his spirit has gone to God who gave it his mutilated body comes back to us to his home to be laid by us in the tomb  Reverently and affectionately we will discharge this last solemn duty and  though his early sun has set Its light shall linger round us yet Bright radiant blest    Young Gentlemen of the Corps of Cadets The memory of General Jackson is very precious to you  You know how faithfully how conscientiously he discharged every duty You know that he was emphatically a man of God  and that Christian principle impressed every act of his life  You know he sustained the honor of our arms when he commanded at Harper s Ferry How gallantly he repulsed Patterson at Hainesville  the invincible stand he made with his Stonewall Brigade at Manassas  you know the brilliant series of successes and victories which immortalized his Valley Campaign  for many of you were under his standard at McDowell  and pursued and discomfited Milroy and Schenck at Franklin  You know his rapid march to the Chickahominy  how he turned the flank of McClellan at Gaines Mill  his subsequent victory over Pope at Cedar Mountain  the part he bore in the great victory at Second Manassas  his investment and capture of Harper s Ferry  his rapid march and great conflict at Sharpsburg  and when his last conflict was passed  the tribute of the magnanimous Lee  who would gladly have suffered in his own person  could he by that sacrifice have saved General Jackson  and to whom alone  under God  he have the whole glory of the great victory at Chancellorsville  Surely the Virginia Military Institute has a precious inheritance in the memory of General Jackson  His work is finished  God gave him to us  and to his country  He fitted him for his work  and when his work was done He called him to Himself  Submissive to the will of his heavenly Father  it may be said of him  that while in every heart there may be some murmuring  his will was to do and suffer the will of God  Reverence the memory of such a man as General Jackson  Imitate his virtues  and here  over his lifeless remains  reverently dedicate your service  and your life  if need be  in defense of the cause so dear to his heart  the cause for which he fought and bled  the cause in which he died  Let the Cadet Battery  which he so long commanded  honor his memory by half hour guns tomorrow from sunrise to sunset  under the direction of the commandant of cadets  Let his lecture room be draped in mourning for the period of six months  Let the officers and cadets of the Institute wear the usual badge of mourning for the period of thirty days  and it is respectfully recommended to the alumni of the institution to unite in this last tribute of respect to the memory of their late professor  All duties will be suspended tomorrow  By

but violent illness  supervening upon the severe wound received in the battle of Chancellorsville  A nation mourns the loss of Genl  Jackson  First in the heart of the brave men he has so often led to victory  there is not a home in the Confederacy that will not feel the loss and lament it as a great national calamity  But our loss is distinctive  He was peculiarly our own  He came to us in 1851  a

victory over Pope at Cedar Mountain  the part he bore in the great victory at Second Manassas  his investment and capture of Harper s Ferry  his rapid march and great conflict at Sharpsburg  and when his last conflict was passed  the tribute of the magnanimous Lee  who would gladly have suffered in his own person  could he by that sacrifice have saved General Jackson  and to whom alone  under God  he have the whole glory of the great victory at Chancellorsville  Surely the Virginia Military Institute has a precious inheritance in the memory of General Jackson  His work is finished  God gave him to us  and to his country  He fitted him for his work  and when his work was done He called him to Himself  Submissive to the will of his heavenly Father  it may be said of him  that while in every heart there may be some murmuring  his will was to do and suffer the will of God  Reverence the memory of such a man as General Jackson  Imitate his virtues  and here  over his lifeless remains
