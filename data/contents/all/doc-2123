Institute Honors Program was developed to enrich the academic experience of VMI s outstanding cadets through activities that encourage an affinity for intellectual inquiry and develop the capacity for sophisticated engagement of issues and problems  whether ethical  civic  or professional  In all of its elements  the program stresses peer leadership  strong oral and written communication skills  and the highest standards of academic integrity and excellence  The Institute Honors Program recognizes a broader range of achievement than honors earned in a particular major  Attainment of Institute Honors is viewed as the highest academic achievement at VMI  The program is open by application to any cadet with a 3 5 or higher GPA  For further information about the program  see the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs  210 Smith Hall  VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  The VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  V CUR  is both a program and a centralized office with the mission of promoting and facilitating faculty mentored undergraduate research and fostering the development of a culture of undergraduate research at VMI  VCUR operates on the premise that some of the most enduring meaningful academic experiences of college students come through opportunities to be mentored one on one by faculty outside the classroom  while also believing in the merit of research and other inquiry based experiences within a more traditional classroom setting  V CUR simultaneously nurtures existing mentoring efforts and coordinates new institutional support for joint investigative projects by faculty members and cadets  Programs include an annual undergraduate Research Symposium held on Post  a Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  cadet travel grants to present at professional meetings or conduct research in the field  Wetmore Fund for supplies for cadet academic year research  and awards to encourage and acknowledge faculty who engage cadets in undergraduate research experiences  For more information  contact the Director Undergraduate Research  300 Preston Library  Institute Writing Program  The Institute Writing Program seeks to equip cadets for both academic success and participation in the full range of rhetorical occasions they will encounter in their lives as citizens and professionals  The program links three important components of the VMI curriculum  our rigorous core curriculum sequence in first year composition  ERH 101  and ERH 102  a thriving Writing Across the Curriculum initiative  which requires cadets to complete two additional  writing intensive  courses prior to graduation  and an interdisciplinary minor in writing for those who wish to pursue advanced training in rhetoric  technical  professional  or creative writing  Cadets  study in the writing curriculum is enhanced by consultants in the VMI Writing Center  who consult individually with cadets at any stage of a writing project  The program sponsors annual writing contests for cadets  local workshops  a nationally regarded symposium for professors of rhetoric and composition  and several presentations on Post each year featuring writers in all genres  For more information  see the Institute Director of Writing  232 Scott Shipp Hall  International Programs  Preparing young men and women for successful service in a world of rapidly integrating

establishment  promotion  and administration of international programs for cadets  Programs offered to cadets fall into a number of categories  international military academy exchange programs  semester abroad programs  summer abroad programs  international internships  and cultural exchanges and study tours  For more information  please contact the Office of International Programs in Old Hospital  Room 101  Internship Program  VMI works actively to assist cadets in any major who seek internship experiences that will allow them to apply test career interests and demonstrate their

completion by offering courses for academic credit during the summer  consistent with the Academic Program Mission  The program is designed to enhance cadet retention  to optimize graduation rates  to provide opportunities for cadets to enrich their education  and to enable cadets to attend the Summer Session and also attend ROTC summer camps  engage in internships  and earn income  It provides the opportunity for cadets to meet curricular  scholarship  athletic  or readmission standards  by enabling them to earn credit for subjects in which they stand deficient or by receiving credit for

offers proactive and innovative programs of academic support for cadets at all levels  Advising  According to the Council for the Advancement of Standards in Higher Education   Academic advising is an essential element of a student s collegiate experience  Academic advising is a four year developmental process in which the advisor both supports and challenges the cadet in an effort to increase the cadet s confidence and self sufficiency  The cadet seeks assistance from the faculty advisor and other VMI personnel to explore and clarify academic  career and life goals  Upon entry into VMI  each cadet is assigned an academic advisor who  unless the cadet subsequently changes academic major  will work with the cadet until graduation  During the first year there is extensive contact between the advisor and cadet in order to facilitate the transition into VMI culture  assist in mastering the academic policies and regulations  and assist the cadet in coordinating the demands of a multi faceted academic and co curricular experience  Upper class cadets have one mandatory contact with advisors each semester but are strongly encouraged to meet with advisors more often in order to benefit from their field specific expertise  life experience and curriculum knowledge  VMI also sponsors an Athletic Advising Program to help scholar athletes keep their focus on academics  For information about the VMI Academic Advising Program  contact the Associate Registrar for Advising Support  Maj  Simone McKelvey  mckelveys vmi edu  301 Shell Hall  Career Services  The Office of Career Services provides a wide array of career planning  employment  internship and graduate professional school services  Centralized career planning services include career exploration and decision making  career information  vocational interest assessment and career related programs  Employment services include job search guidance  resume assistance  interview skills training  employer information and recruitment programs  Graduate education support includes information on graduate professional school admissions testing  Choice of Career  VMI has been privileged by a solid record as a learning model that prepares leaders of business  education and government  The unique combination of activities in the classroom  co curricular and barracks life distinguish graduates with the ability to function in a variety of settings and achieve noteworthy results  The concept of citizen soldier encompasses the ideal that the VMI experience prepares graduates to become useful members of society  In general  VMI s technical curricula teach more immediately employment related skills  whereas the non technical curricula provide a more broadly based body of knowledge in the arts and sciences  with emphasis in a particular academic discipline  However  the choosing of a particular major in which to specialize need not exclude a cadet from a particular career  because all curricula provide the basic educational foundation essential for a variety of occupations  Employers  as well as graduate and professional schools  value the individual who uses words with clarity and force  who possesses the capacity to handle abstract and quantitative ideas  who effectively works harmoniously and productively with others  who understands human institutions and the social and economic environment  and who thinks independently  Personal attributes of integrity and dependability are of great worth  Development of such basic abilities is not the monopoly of any course or curriculum  or even of the academic program itself  for at VMI it is the total program of academic  military  and extracurricular activity that fosters such development  If leadership may be defined as the ability to organize and effectively direct one s own time and energies and to aid others to do the same  then the life of a cadet is a real as opposed to an imaginary experience in applied leadership  Accordingly  success within the challenging VMI system requires the development of leadership abilities  qualities that have been most favorably noted by employers of our graduates  Career opportunities are especially open to those who have demonstrated the capacity to work hard to achieve worthy goals  In short  the Virginia Military Institute strives to provide a climate in which a student may become an educated  healthy  whole person  Center for Cadet Counseling  In the Col  Mike E   Doc  Monsour Center for Cadet Development and Counseling  professional counselors work to facilitate the personal development of cadets to meet their full academic and personal potential and to promote the health and wellness of cadets  The center provides short term counseling to address personal concerns that may impede current and future learning and personal development  Counselors may also provide crisis intervention services to prevent  resolve  and or minimize the effects of crises on cadets and the Institute community  The center provides speakers and facilitators for psycho educational  wellness focused programs  including training for cadet groups  guest lecturers in classes  special interest speakers at events  and facilitators for group discussions  Counselors may consult with VMI employees  cadets  and family members who are concerned about cadets  Although all counseling information is confidential  counselors can offer general recommendations on assisting cadets that are having difficulties  Disabilities Services works to provide all cadets with an equal opportunity to achieve academic success  Cadets with learning disabilities meet with the Director of Disabilities Services to develop individual support programs  including classroom accommodations  Cadets who have never been tested for a learning disability may be screened on Post at no cost and  if warranted  may choose to be tested by a specialist off Post at their own expense  Information

necessary to reinforce that picture  In this  MERC staff assesses what mathematical skills and experiences a VMI cadet has prior to admission  The MERC staff then strives to understand what expectations military  community  and private businesses have with regards to the mathematical skills and mathematical reasoning of a graduating cadet  Finally  in this knowledge of where a cadet starts and where they will go next  the MERC staff provides every possible means to support that cadet s exciting journey through VMI  The primary resource for service of the cadet corps  mathematical needs is the Open Mathematics Lab  OML  Its initial design allows cadets to freely seek and find as much help as needed for any of VMI s mathematics core curriculum courses and pre calculus  differential equations  matrix algebra  and multivariable calculus courses  The model for the lab is one wherein tutors are prepared to help cadets in an open and shared setting  where no appointments are necessary  OML tutors are trained  knowledgeable  and current on the specific techniques and problems taught by VMI mathematics teaching faculty  The OML is meant to complement and support  but not replace  course activities within the VMI mathematics curriculum  Miller Academic Center  The Miller Academic Center s motto is  Empowering Cadets to be Extraordinary  Whether a cadet is
