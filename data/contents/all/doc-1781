VMI Statement of General Principles VMI is committed to the pursuit of excellence in teaching  research  and public service  Members of the Institute community  while upholding the highest standards of freedom of inquiry and communication  accept the responsibility this freedom entails  for competence  for objectivity  for consideration of the best interests of the Institute and society  and for the welfare of every participant in a project  The IRB is primarily concerned with the welfare and consideration of the best interests of all subjects participating in research  the Institute  and society  The Institute gives assurance that it will comply with the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  regulations for the Protection of Human Research Subjects  45 CFR 46  as amended  Thus  the following principles are affirmed and should be interpreted in the broad context provided by the code of medical and general ethics promulgated by the World Medical Association as the Declaration of Helsinki and by the Ethical Principles in the Conduct of Research with Human Participants of the American Psychological Association  Copies of all documents  including VMI s Assurance of Compliance with HHS Regulations  are on file in the office of the Assistant Dean for Research  Because participation of humans in research and training projects raises fundamental ethical and civil rights questions  no distinctions in the monitoring of projects will be drawn between funded and unfunded projects  sponsored and unsponsored projects  or among projects carried out by students  faculty  or other Institute employees  on campus or off campus  Furthermore  approval by an agency that will be used to obtain subjects is necessary to obtain final IRB approval for the project  Review by another IRB  however  does not replace that of the VMI Board for studies conducted under the aegis of the Institute  All activities involving humans as subjects must provide for the safety  health  and welfare of every individual  Rights  including the right of privacy  must not be infringed  The direct or potential benefits to the subject  or the importance of the knowledge to be gained  must outweigh the inherent risks to the individual  Participation in projects must be voluntary  and informed consent must be obtained from all subjects  unless this requirement is specifically waived by the IRB  Investigators may establish a process consistent with guidelines for the process of documenting informed consent  guidelines as stated in Section X  beginning on page 18  Methods that are in accordance with the requirements of 45 CFR 46 116 and 45 CFR 46 117 and are adequate and appropriate to the risks of the project must be used to obtain the subject s informed consent  Consent should be obtained whenever appropriate from the participants themselves  If a subject is adjudicated to be not legally capable of giving informed consent  a legally authorized representative may do so  Any process by which informed consent is secured must consider the ability of the potential participant to comprehend the information and competently respond  Careful consideration shall be given to the representative s depth of interest and concern with the subject s rights and welfare  Informed consent must be secured for every project in which a person might participate  An individual does not abdicate any rights by consenting to be a research subject  A subject has the right to withdraw from a research project at any time or can refuse to participate without loss of benefits to which the subject would otherwise be entitled  Further  a subject has the right to receive appropriate professional care to enjoy privacy and confidentiality in the use of personal information and to be free from undue embarrassment  discomfort  anxiety  and or harassment  Safeguarding information about an individual that has been obtained in the course of an investigation is a primary obligation of the investigator  The faculty sponsor is always responsible for the monitoring of procedures  Such information shall not be communicated to others unless the following conditions are met  Explicit written permission for the release of identifying data is given by the individual  The consent form to release information must be independent of the Informed Consent Form and must specify the name s  of the person s  or agencies to whom the data will be released  Information about individuals may be discussed only for professional purposes and only with persons clearly involved in the project  Written and oral reports should present only data germane to the purposes of the project  and every effort should be made to avoid invasion of privacy  Provisions must also be made for the maintenance of confidentiality in the preservation and ultimate disposition of any data collected  Adequate security measures must be described to the IRB and carried out by the principal investigator until the records are destroyed Information in the records which contain personal information that could permit another person to identify a subject should be destroyed as soon as possible in keeping with the long range goals of the project and federal regulations requiring the maintenance of primary data for a period of three years  Projects will be given initial and continuing review by the IRB as set forth in the description of Review Procedures and Criteria for Approval  Section VII  beginning on page 12 All members of the Institute community involved in investigation and training are responsible for continual monitoring to assure compliance of their research with these principles  No individual involved in the conduct and or supervision of a specific project shall participate in IRB review of his her project  except to provide information  A second review may be required  if six months has elapsed between IRB review and project initiation  if natural or unforeseen circumstances warrant a change in procedure  or if the principal investigator intends to change procedures after the proposed project has been approved by the IRB  In all cases  the investigator should show practical regard for the VMI community  recognizing thatviolations of the ethical and legal standards incorporated in this statement of principles  for example  concerning confidentiality  informed consent  and regard for the health  safety and welfare of all human subjects  could impugn the investigator s own name and the reputation of the Institute  Furthermore  the investigator should ensure that the research staff is reasonably protected from harm  The investigator does not abdicate ethical and legal responsibility merely by complying with this protocol It is always the responsibility of the investigator to obtain clearance from the IRB prior to the initiation of any research activity involving the use of human subjects  Failure to do so may result in personal restrictions on the research activities of such individuals  as well as potential endangerment of all federal funding to the Institute  IRB Applicants Create Account Login Administrator Login VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
