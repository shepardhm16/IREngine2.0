program is focused on avian biology  Since the mid 1990s  I have been working to document the different species of birds found in Rockbridge County  VA  In 1957  JJ Murray  one of the founders of the

providing an up date to Murray s book  Rockbridge County has a rich history of birding activity including a Christmas Bird Count that began in 1922 and has run continuously since 1936  As would be expected with any area  there have been a number of changes to the environment of the county  the Interstate system was created  several lakes and ponds were created  a few ponds drained  and farm land has been converted to residential land  These changes have had some impact on the bird species present  but in general  the county continues to see a large number of species living in or passing

year  my research student and I have recorded vocalizations of Tree Swallows associated with normal daily activities  feeding  territorial calls  nestling calls  as well as responses to threats  Our initial work has been to catalogue the different vocalizations of the Tree Swallows and document the behavioral context for the different calls  The different calls have been analyzed using Raven Software developed by the Laboratory for Bioacoustics at Cornell University  The use of Raven allows us to quantify the calls to determine note and phrase duration  sequencing of notes  frequency characteristics of notes  and temporal patterning of vocalizations  In addition  we created playback tapes of  alarm calls to verify that these calls were  indeed  alarm calls  The playback experiments demonstrated that we had identified an alarm call and that the birds responded appropriately to the playback calls  During the summer of 2013  my research student and I are examining nest defense behavior in Tree Swallows  We are using alarm calls recorded during the summer of 2012 to investigate defense behavior and whether this behavior changes as the nesting phase progresses from nest building through egg laying and incubation to feeding nestlings and finally fledgelings that are mobile    Col  Richard Rowe Home Courses Research VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams

Rowe Research My research program is focused on avian biology  Since the mid 1990s  I have been working to document the different species of birds found in Rockbridge County  VA  In 1957  JJ Murray  one of the founders of the Virginia Society of Ornitholoy and pastor of the Lexington Presbyterian Church  published the Birds of Rockbirdge County  Virginia as the first publication of Virginia Avifauna of the VSO  My work is providing an up date to Murray s book  Rockbridge County has a rich history of birding activity including a Christmas Bird Count that began in 1922 and has run continuously since 1936  As would be expected with any area  there have been a number of changes to the environment of the county  the Interstate system was created  several lakes and ponds were created  a few ponds drained  and farm land has been converted to residential land  These changes have had some impact on the bird species present  but in general  the county continues to see a large number of species living in or passing through the area each year  My Birds of Rockbridge County webpage can be accessed through the following link  The photographs associated with the chapters of the book were  except for a few exceptions  all taken in  Rockbridge County    Birds of Rockbridge County  In addition to the Birds of Rockbridge County webpage  I maintain a photogallery on Flickr  The photogallery is divided into photographs of birds seen in Rockbridge County and photographs of birds seen in Virginia    Photogallery  A second focus of my research laboratory is investigating alarm calls in Tree Swallows  During the past year  my research student and I have recorded vocalizations of Tree Swallows associated with normal daily activities  feeding  territorial calls  nestling calls  as well as responses to threats  Our initial work has been to catalogue the different vocalizations of the Tree Swallows and document the behavioral context for the different calls  The different calls have been analyzed using Raven Software developed by the Laboratory for Bioacoustics at Cornell University  The use of Raven allows us to quantify the calls to determine note and phrase duration  sequencing of notes  frequency characteristics of notes  and temporal patterning of vocalizations  In addition  we created playback tapes of  alarm calls to verify that these calls were  indeed
