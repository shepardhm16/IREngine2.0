suggests that the rise of autoimmune diseases in developed nations is due to improved sanitation and subsequent reduction of internal parasites of humans  An increasing body of evidence suggests that many intestinal parasites manipulate their host s immune system in order to reduce the immune response that is mounted against them  Without our intestinal parasites to down regulate the immune response  humans may now be more prone to autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory bowl disease  asthma  lupus  and type 1 diabetes  My students and I are collaborating with Hamilton s animal physiologist  Dave Gapp  to use the mouse nematode  Heligmosomoides bakeri  and a chemically induced model of early type 1 diabetes to explore the effect of intestinal worms on this important autoimmune disease  Helminth Parasites of Muskrats Muskrats  with their semi aquatic lifestyle and omnivorous feeding habits  are ideal hosts for the study of parasite community ecology  My students and I are surveying the parasitic worms of muskrats in central New York  In the first year of the study  we found 12 species of parasites  including 5 adult digenetic trematodes  2 adult and 2 larval cestodes  2 adult nematodes  and 1 larval acanthocephalan  We are continuing the study for the 2011 2012 winter trapping season and are beginning to use molecular data to address questions of species
