field of parameter estimation is an  inverse  method which requires calculation of a direct solution  usually several times  in order to fit measured information to a mathematical model  For example  in the figure below  measurements were taken of the temperature on the back side of a heated plate   The measurements are shown as red squares and the mathematical model is depicted as a continuous line  A mathematical model was developed which described the heat transfer process  The parameters within that model were found which minimized the sum of squares of the errors between the temperatures predicted by the mathematical model and the measured temperatures  The expression used for finding this minimum of errors is where  T  represents the calculated temperatures and  Y  represents the measured temperatures  The parameters of the mathematical model for the direct heat transfer solution are found such that  S  is minimized  For a case of conductive heat transfer  the mathematical model for the temperature solution may be quite complex such as   where the eigen values are the solution to the following equation  In this situation  the parameters cannot be solved for explicitly and the least squares routine will have to iterate through non linear regression  The unknown parameters in this example are thermal diffusivity  designated by the greek letter alpha  thermal conductivity  designated by the letter k  and Biot number  designated by the symbol Bi  The Biot number in this case is simply hL k where h is the heat transfer coefficient and L is the thickness of the sample  The iterations in a problem such as the one above are continued until convergence is obtained  This is usually the point at which the changes in all parameters between iterations varies by less than 0 1  At this point  convergence is considered to have been obtained and the parameter estimates are reported by the computer program  The above example involves one dimensional heat transfer through a heated flat plate  but this method can be applied to almost any geometry or heat transfer mechanism  Although heat transfer is my main area of work  the field of parameter estimation applies to a wide range of areas which can be modeled and fitted to measurements from the field  For example  a study undertaken for a co generation power plant set out to determine the unit costs associated with steam delivered for heating and electrical power delivered  The graph below shows a mathematical model of energy generation cost plotted against both heating steam and electrical energy delivered   The axis  Sd  represents steam demand and the  E  axis represents electrical demand  The  Sb  axis represents the total amount of boiler steam delivered in order to generate the coincident combination of low pressure steam and electrical energy  The cost of boiler steam can then be traced directly in terms of dollars per pound  The equation for the plane shown in this graph was generated by fitting the following equation to the monthly boiler log data  Sb   I   XsSd   XeE In this equation  the  I  term represents the y intercept on the graph  which corresponds to internal steam use and losses within the plant  In essence  this is a  base  operating cost with no steam or electricity delivered  The Xs and Xe terms are the parameters to be found where Xs Unit cost of steam  lb  Xe Unit cost of electrical energy  KWh  These parameters are found by fitting the mathematical model shown above to the monthly boiler logs in order to minimize the sum of squares of the errors between the model and the measurements  In other words  the following expression is minimized where the  Y  values correspond to the measurements and the  T  values correspond to the prediction by the mathematical model  In this way  several models can be fitted and the most appropriate model can be selected based on the comparison of the results generated from the competing models  Once again  these models are normally based on heat transfer problems  but the example above is shown in order to highlight the diversity of problems which can be addressed using parameter estimation methods    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination

transfer process  The parameters within that model were found which minimized the sum of squares of the errors between the temperatures predicted by the mathematical model and the measured temperatures  The expression used for finding this minimum of errors is where  T  represents the calculated temperatures and  Y  represents the measured temperatures  The parameters of the mathematical model for the direct heat transfer solution are found such that  S  is minimized  For a case of conductive heat transfer  the mathematical model for the temperature solution may be quite complex such as   where the eigen values are the solution to the following equation  In this situation  the parameters cannot be solved for explicitly and the least squares routine will have to iterate through non linear regression  The unknown parameters in this example are thermal diffusivity  designated by the greek letter alpha  thermal conductivity  designated by the letter k  and Biot number  designated by the symbol Bi  The Biot number in this case is simply hL k where h is the heat transfer coefficient and L is the thickness of the sample  The iterations in a problem such as the one above are continued until convergence is obtained  This is usually the point at which the changes in all parameters between iterations varies by less than 0 1  At this point  convergence is considered to have been obtained and the parameter estimates are reported by the computer program  The above example involves one dimensional heat transfer through a heated flat plate  but this method can be applied to almost any geometry or heat transfer mechanism  Although heat transfer is my main area of work  the field of parameter estimation applies to a wide range of areas which can be modeled and fitted to measurements from the field  For example  a study undertaken for a co generation power plant set out to determine the unit costs associated with steam delivered for heating and electrical power delivered  The graph below shows a mathematical model of energy generation cost plotted against both heating steam and electrical energy delivered   The axis  Sd  represents steam demand and the  E  axis represents electrical demand  The  Sb  axis represents the total amount of boiler steam delivered in order to generate the coincident combination of low pressure steam and electrical energy  The cost of boiler steam can then be traced directly in terms of dollars per pound  The equation for the plane shown in this graph was generated by fitting the following equation to the monthly boiler log data  Sb   I   XsSd   XeE In this equation  the  I  term represents the y intercept on the graph  which corresponds to internal steam use and losses within the plant  In essence  this is a  base  operating cost with no steam or electricity delivered  The Xs and Xe terms are the parameters to be found where Xs Unit cost of steam  lb  Xe Unit cost of electrical energy  KWh  These parameters are found by fitting the mathematical model shown above to the monthly boiler logs in order to minimize the sum of squares of the errors between the model and the measurements  In other words  the following expression is minimized where the  Y  values correspond to the measurements and the  T  values correspond to the prediction by the mathematical model  In this way  several models can be fitted and the most appropriate model can be selected based on the comparison of the results generated from the competing models  Once again  these models are normally based on heat
