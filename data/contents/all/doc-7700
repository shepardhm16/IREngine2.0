collections and services exist to support the curricula offered by Virginia Military Institute  a liberal arts and engineering institution of approximately 1600 undergraduate students  to support the research interests of the faculty  and to provide materials for the pursuit of the intellectual and cultural interests of the community  Although Virginia Military Institute is primarily a teaching institution  faculty and students engage in significant research which the Library supports through such services as on line bibliographic searching  inter library loan  access to a large collection of scholarly materials online  and the selection of research level materials for the Library s collection  Faculty members are strongly urged to distinguish between a research collection and one that is designed to meet the needs of undergraduates  Relationship with other libraries Preston Library is the Institute s library and holds or provides access to VMI s library collections  The Virginia Military Institute  Washington and Lee University  and Southern Virginia University have reciprocal borrowing privileges for cadet  faculty  and staff  Resources are also shared with the Rockbridge Public Library  The Institute s Library actively participates in inter library loan programs to augment the Library s holdings  Purpose of a collection policy This document will provide guidelines for selection  descriptions of individual collections  and general information about the development and maintenance of the collections of the Institute Library  The policy is a planning device and an avenue of communication between the Library and the user community  It is hoped that a written collection policy will enable selectors to make the best possible use of finite resources  Collection development responsibilities The Institute Library has developed a strong collection to support the academic needs of faculty and cadets through the joint efforts of the faculty and the library staff  With the trend towards access over ownership  the Library s faculty and staff have increasingly built online and electronic collections  Our electronic collections have been vastly enhanced by The Virtual Library of Virginia  VIVA  which was founded in 1994  Members of the library faculty and staff have responsibility for specific subject areas  see Appendix E  and have final responsibility for additions to the collection  The Library s faculty and staff members review new requests  evaluate them against the present collection and Institute programs  and consult with the requestor about items which do not meet stated selection criteria  This procedure assumes a knowledge of the present collection  curricula  and research needs on the part of both the teaching and library faculties and a willingness of all parties to work together to achieve the fairest allocation of funds  Selection criteria In consideration of the acquisition of library materials the following points are considered  A  The support a selection gives to the curricula as stated in the catalog and usefulness to the community the library serves  B  Authority of the author  C  Reputation of the publisher  D  Timeliness or permanence of the resource  E  Quality of the writing or production  F  Accuracy of the information  G  Language of the publication  English being preferred except for programs which require foreign languages such as Modern Languages  H  Relation of the material to other resources in the collection  I  Price  both purchase price and costs of maintenance and storage  J  Availability of the same or similar material in the geographic area  especially the Washington and Lee University libraries  K  Implications for preservation  The ultimate goal is to build a collection that supports an advanced undergraduate curricula including independent study and faculty research  General Guidelines A  Foreign language publications  The Library acquires materials in the foreign languages taught at the Institute which support those courses  These materials normally include literary works  selected newspapers and magazines  dictionaries  encyclopedias  and indexes  Materials to support other courses are purchased in English  B  Retrospective purchases and out of print materials  The Library will make retrospective purchases and have the out of print market searched for essential materials which cannot be obtained in any other manner  Additional screening of such requests must include such factors as other editions held by the Library or available through the marketplace and the condition of older volumes proposed for purchase  C  Duplicates  The general library policy is to purchase one copy of a title  Requests for multiple copies are considered by the library staff selectors and selected on an individual basis  With regard to journals  when a journal becomes available online  it will replace the print edition  D  Replacement  Titles in the collection reported missing will be promptly replaced if needed for teaching or research  if they are still obtainable  Items not needed for teaching or research will be replaced on a case by case basis determined by the selection criteria  Section V  if still available  E  Gifts  Preston Library welcomes gifts and donations of useful materials  or money to purchase them  provided no restrictions are attached Donated materials become the property of the Friends of Preston Library Monetary appraisal and inventory of materials is the responsibility of the donor  Preston Library staff will evaluate gift materials for addition to library collections by the same selection criteria as purchased materials  Unneeded items such as duplicates or items that do not meet selection criteria may be sold  exchanged  donated  or discarded  F  Weeding  Periodically  the collection will be examined for material to be withdrawn  Candidates for disposal include materials which no longer support the curricula  superseded editions  unneeded duplicate copies  alternative formats  out of date text books  and materials in poor condition  Procedures may include consultation with faculty and selectors  analysis of the amount and date of circulation  available shelf space  and comparison of holdings with Washington and Lee University  Types of materials A  General collection Selection responsibility for items designation for the general collection rests upon the Library s faculty and staff  Presently  each department receives an allocation of funds based upon a formula  see Appendix A  The Library s faculty and staff review new requests and evaluate them on the basis of the present collection  Institute curricula  and selection criteria  Section V  and consult with the requestor regarding items not meeting these criteria  Monographs which cost more than  150 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  B  Special print formats 1  Serials  The Library holds subscriptions to about 250 print periodicals and 275  continuations  i e  annuals  monographic series  or sets for which the Library has a standing order  The Library also has access to over 100 000 full text scholarly journals online  Selection criteria stated in Section V apply to serials  Because serial purchases involve continuing expenditures made more critical by progressive increases  binding costs and or microform additions  requests for new subscriptions should be accompanied by sample copies of the title  which the Library will obtain  if necessary  and a written justification for the purchase including relevance to the curricula  with specific courses named  to research projects  to the Library s collection  or the needs of the Institute s community  See Appendix B  A helpful guide to the potential usefulness of a serial title is its indexing  including both print and on line indexing services  Current periodicals are usually acquired in print form  with the intention of retaining copies for binding  Back files are usually acquired in microform  Requests for new subscriptions are received by the Technical Services Librarian and reviewed by the librarians  The complete serials list is reviewed by departments every two or three years  2  Newspapers  The Library subscribes to about 20 print newspapers from different parts of the United States and foreign countries  Papers for which the Library s hold the indexes are kept permanently in microform  The microform holdings are for the indexed years with the exception of such local papers as the News Gazette  the Richmond Times Dispatch  and the Roanoke Times  Subscriptions are held for papers of regional interest those acquired primarily for the students   home town  appeal and publications of neighboring colleges  Newspaper subscriptions come under the serials budget and control systems  New subscriptions must be justified by the requestor in the same manner as any other serial subscription  Both general selection criteria  Section V  and serials selection criteria  immediately above  apply to newspaper subscriptions  3  Maps and atlases  Preston Library does not maintain a map collection as such  Local area  major city  and highway maps are acquired as needed and filed  uncataloged  in the Reference Room  The Civil Engineering Department has a map collection which is maintained and administered by that department and is not part of the Library s collection  Some maps are received from the government publications depository system  see Section VIII B  Atlases are purchased and shelved as part of the general reference collection  Older materials are located in the stacks  some items qualify for special protection and are housed in the Archives  4  Music  Purchases of sheet music or scores are subject to the general selection criteria  Section V  They are cataloged into the general collection and shelved in the stacks or with the Timmins Collection if appropriate  5  Archives  a  Official Institute Records  The Archives acquires and preserves official records that are of permanent historical or administrative value  These records include  but are not limited to  selected records of the Board of Visitors  Superintendent  and other senior administrators  Institute publications  non current student records  records that document cadet life  significant events  programs  decisions  policies  or Institute activities  and records that are defined as permanent by the Virginia State Library and Archives in its records retention schedules  VMI Record Groups are periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect organizational changes  b  Manuscripts  The department considers for acquisition manuscripts  personal papers  in the categories listed below  Final acquisition decisions are based upon many factors  if we feel that we are not the best fit for a collection  we will be happy to recommend other repositories  Manuscripts are typically acquired through donation  Except under unusual circumstances  we accept unrestricted gifts only and all material will be open to public research  We do not accept material on loan  a  Papers of alumni  faculty  administrators  or other individuals connected to VMI  if such papers have current or potential research value or if they are of significant symbolic value to the Institute  Collections documenting the military service and leadership activities of alumni are of particular interest  b  Personal papers documenting Institute history and cadet life c  Papers relating to specific aspects of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley  including the Battle of New Market  Hunter s Raid  other military engagements or activities involving the Corps of Cadets  and Stonewall Jackson  d  Other collections which relate to or complement collections held in the above categories  c  Photographs  The department actively collects images  1839   present  that document Institute history  These include photographs of individual cadets  buildings and grounds  faculty  and cadet life  We also collect images associated with the other broad areas listed under manuscripts  above  Particular emphasis is placed on the period before a yearbook was regularly published  1895  and on candid photographs of cadet life that do not routinely appear in official sources  d  The VMI Archives houses the Institute s rare book collection  New holdings are acquired largely through donations  C  Non print formats The same criteria  Section V  will be used for the selection of audiovisual materials and other non print media as is used for print media  scope of curricula  faculty and student needs  quality of item  and life expectancy of the item  The non print collection must complement  not conflict or compete with other library collections  Media materials over  400 will be reviewed by the librarians  Non print formats will include microfilm and microfiche  computer software  audiocassettes for the spoken word  compact discs for music  DVDs for motion video  and other emerging formats  The format selection should reflect the quality and quantity of equipment available for its utilization  Selection will be made by the Media Services Librarian who will solicit help in the evaluation process from subject specialists among the faculty  Faculty will also be encouraged to make selections within their discipline  The major areas to evaluate are  content  educational value  technical aspects  and quality of presentation  Whenever possible audiovisual materials will previewed before purchase or ordered on approval  D  Textbooks  Defined as information that is written particularly for use by students to introduce a subject  typically incorporating such characteristics as surveying or giving an overview of the subject  containing excerpts from other literary works  listing review questions at chapter endings  etc  textbooks will not ordinarily be acquired  Exceptions will be made upon specific  justified  requests  Collections A  Reference The reference collection contains encyclopedias  indexes  directories  handbooks  bibliographies  dictionaries  and other materials which are generally not meant to be read consecutively but rather to be consulted for definite items of information  These materials have historically been in print formats  Recently  however  an increasing number are becoming available electronically  The greatest concentration is placed upon those needs that arise from study and research activities directly related to the undergraduate curricula  Also  an attempt is made to acquire basic or standard reference sources which may not be directly relevant to any particular academic department or discipline at Virginia Military Institute such as materials on travel  employment  consumer information  and education  Reference materials are chosen by the Reference librarians with assistance and suggestions from library staff  faculty members  students  and others  Reference materials which are over  500 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  Decisions regarding the acquisition of materials for the reference collection are made on the basis of several criteria  The purpose of the work  Reference works are intended to be referred to or consulted  rather than read through  Relevance to the Library s needs  The Reference Department staff takes into consideration both the undergraduate curricula and past demand for information  usually made evident at the Reference desk  The authority of the work  Are the publisher and the author reputable  The scope of the work  The scope of an item should not be so narrow that a researcher is likely to need to make extensive use of it  For example  a bibliography of criticism of William Faulkner s writings should be in the main collection  while bibliographies of criticism of American literature could be in Reference  The intended audience of the work  Consider level of education  foreign language  etc  The currency of information  Though some Reference materials are  timeless  currency is important when up to date information is needed  Organization of the work  Though personal inspection previous to purchase is frequently not possible  reviews and other communications can describe the usefulness of the manner in which information is presented  Local availability of the work  Is it owned by Washington and Lee University  Price of the work  B  Government publications Preston Library is a selective depository for United States government publications  New series are selected by the Documents Librarian in consultation with library selectors and faculty  Presently these documents are controlled under the Superintendent of Documents classification and  generally  not cataloged into the collection  Specific documents are identified and fully integrated into the collection   See Appendix C for a complete statement  C  Rare books Rare is defined as follows  Old and valuable for content  binding  illustration and or printing Recent and valuable for content  illustration and or printing Some first and limited editions Fragile materials of permanent interest Published material of special interest to the Virginia Military Institute or to the local area  Rare books are housed in the VMI Archives  These books are mainly acquired as gifts  though from time to time purchases have been made for this collection  D  Timmins Music Collection The Timmins Music Collection is a memorial collection of classical music on LP phonograph records and compact disks  Additions to the collection are compact disk only and selection is made by library staff  members of the Timmins Society  and the Society s faculty advisor  Intellectual freedom The principles of intellectual freedom as outlined in the Library Bill of Rights of the American Library Association will be adhered to in the selection of library materials  It is the responsibility of the librarians and faculty selecting materials to ensure that all points of view are represented in the collection and that materials are not removed from the collection because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval  Copyright The Virginia Military Institute Library abides by all regulations of relevant sections in the Copyright Revision Act of 1976  U S  Code Title 17

Appendix D Government Publications Appendix E Selection and Deselection Assignments Purpose of the Institute Library Preston Library s collections and services exist to support the curricula offered by Virginia Military Institute  a liberal arts and engineering institution of approximately 1600 undergraduate students  to support the research interests of the faculty  and to provide materials for the pursuit of the intellectual and cultural interests of the community  Although Virginia Military Institute is primarily a teaching institution  faculty and students engage in significant research which the Library supports through such services as on line bibliographic searching  inter library loan  access to a large collection of scholarly materials online  and the selection of research level materials for the Library s collection  Faculty members are strongly urged to distinguish between a research collection and one that is designed to meet the needs of undergraduates  Relationship with other libraries Preston Library is the Institute s library and holds or provides access to VMI s library collections  The Virginia Military Institute  Washington and Lee University  and Southern Virginia University have reciprocal borrowing privileges for cadet  faculty  and staff  Resources are also shared with the Rockbridge Public Library  The Institute s Library actively participates in inter library loan programs to augment the Library s holdings  Purpose of a collection policy This document will provide guidelines for selection  descriptions of individual collections  and general information about the development and maintenance of the collections of the Institute Library  The policy is a planning device and an avenue of communication between the Library and the user community  It is hoped that a written collection policy will enable selectors to make the best possible use of finite resources  Collection development responsibilities The Institute Library has developed a strong collection to support the academic needs of faculty and cadets through the joint efforts of the faculty and the library staff  With the trend towards access over ownership  the Library s faculty and staff have increasingly built online and electronic collections  Our electronic collections have been vastly enhanced by The Virtual Library of Virginia  VIVA  which was founded in 1994  Members of the library faculty and staff have responsibility for specific subject areas  see Appendix E  and have final responsibility for additions to the collection  The Library s faculty and staff members review new requests  evaluate them against the present collection and Institute programs  and consult with the requestor about items which do not meet stated selection criteria  This procedure assumes a knowledge of the present collection  curricula  and research needs on the part of both the teaching and library faculties and a willingness of all parties to work together to achieve the fairest allocation of funds  Selection criteria In consideration of the acquisition of library materials the following points are considered  A  The support a selection gives to the curricula as stated in the catalog and usefulness to the community the library serves  B  Authority of the author  C  Reputation of the publisher  D  Timeliness or permanence of the resource  E  Quality of the writing or production  F  Accuracy of the information  G  Language of the publication  English being preferred except for programs which require foreign languages such as Modern Languages  H  Relation of the material to other resources in the collection  I  Price  both purchase price and costs of maintenance and storage  J  Availability of the same or similar material in the geographic area  especially the Washington and Lee University libraries  K  Implications for preservation  The ultimate goal is to build a collection that supports an advanced undergraduate curricula including independent study and faculty research  General Guidelines A  Foreign language publications  The Library acquires materials in the foreign languages taught at the Institute which support those courses  These materials normally include literary works  selected newspapers and magazines  dictionaries  encyclopedias  and indexes  Materials to support other courses are purchased in English  B  Retrospective purchases and out of print materials  The Library will make retrospective purchases and have the out of print market searched for essential materials which cannot be obtained in any other manner  Additional screening of such requests must include such factors as other editions held by the Library or available through the marketplace and the condition of older volumes proposed for purchase  C  Duplicates  The general library policy is to purchase one copy of a title  Requests for multiple copies are considered by the library staff selectors and selected on an individual basis  With regard to journals  when a journal becomes available online  it will replace the print edition  D  Replacement  Titles in the collection reported missing will be promptly replaced if needed for teaching or research  if they are still obtainable  Items not needed for teaching or research will be replaced on a case by case basis determined by the selection criteria  Section V  if still available  E  Gifts  Preston Library welcomes gifts and donations of useful materials  or money to purchase them  provided no restrictions are attached Donated materials become the property of the Friends of Preston Library Monetary appraisal and inventory of materials is the responsibility of the donor  Preston Library staff will evaluate gift materials for addition to library collections by the same selection criteria as purchased materials  Unneeded items such as duplicates or items that do not meet selection criteria may be sold  exchanged  donated  or discarded  F  Weeding  Periodically  the collection will be examined for material to be withdrawn  Candidates for disposal include materials which no longer support the curricula  superseded editions  unneeded duplicate copies  alternative formats  out of date text books  and materials in poor condition  Procedures may include consultation with faculty and selectors  analysis of the amount and date of circulation  available shelf space  and comparison of holdings with Washington and Lee University  Types of materials A  General collection Selection responsibility for items designation for the general collection rests upon the Library s faculty and staff  Presently  each department receives an allocation of funds based upon a formula  see Appendix A  The Library s faculty and staff review new requests and evaluate them on the basis of the present collection  Institute curricula  and selection criteria  Section V  and consult with the requestor regarding items not meeting these criteria  Monographs which cost more than  150 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  B  Special print formats 1  Serials  The Library holds subscriptions to about 250 print periodicals and 275  continuations  i e  annuals  monographic series  or sets for which the Library has a standing order  The Library also has access to over 100 000 full text scholarly journals online  Selection criteria stated in Section V apply to serials  Because serial purchases involve continuing expenditures made more critical by progressive increases  binding costs and or microform additions  requests for new subscriptions should be accompanied by sample copies of the title  which the Library will obtain  if necessary  and a written justification for the purchase including relevance to the curricula  with specific courses named  to research projects  to the Library s collection  or the needs of the Institute s community  See Appendix B  A helpful guide to the potential usefulness of a serial title is its indexing  including both print and on line indexing services  Current periodicals are usually acquired in print form  with the intention of retaining copies for binding  Back files are usually acquired in microform  Requests for new subscriptions are received by the Technical Services Librarian and reviewed by the librarians  The complete serials list is reviewed by departments every two or three years  2  Newspapers  The Library subscribes to about 20 print newspapers from different parts of the United States and foreign countries  Papers for which the Library s hold the indexes are kept permanently in microform  The microform holdings are for the indexed years with the exception of such local papers as the News Gazette  the Richmond Times Dispatch  and the Roanoke Times  Subscriptions are held for papers of regional interest those acquired primarily for the students   home town  appeal and publications of neighboring colleges  Newspaper subscriptions come under the serials budget and control systems  New subscriptions must be justified by the requestor in the same manner as any other serial subscription  Both general selection criteria  Section V  and serials selection criteria  immediately above  apply to newspaper subscriptions  3  Maps and atlases  Preston Library does not maintain a map collection as such  Local area  major city  and highway maps are acquired as needed and filed  uncataloged  in the Reference Room  The Civil Engineering Department has a map collection which is maintained and administered by that department and is not part of the Library s collection  Some maps are received from the government publications depository system  see Section VIII B  Atlases are purchased and shelved as part of the general reference collection  Older materials are located in the stacks  some items qualify for special protection and are housed in the Archives  4  Music  Purchases of sheet music or scores are subject to the general selection criteria  Section V  They are cataloged into the general collection and shelved in the stacks or with the Timmins Collection if appropriate  5  Archives  a  Official Institute Records  The Archives acquires and preserves official records that are of permanent historical or administrative value  These records include  but are not limited to  selected records of the Board of Visitors  Superintendent  and other senior administrators  Institute publications  non current student records  records that document cadet life  significant events  programs  decisions  policies  or Institute activities  and records that are defined as permanent by the Virginia State Library and Archives in its records retention schedules  VMI Record Groups are periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect organizational changes  b  Manuscripts  The department considers for acquisition manuscripts  personal papers  in the categories listed below  Final acquisition decisions are based upon many factors  if we feel that we are not the best fit for a collection  we will be happy to recommend other repositories  Manuscripts are typically acquired through donation  Except under unusual circumstances  we accept unrestricted gifts only and all material will be open to public research  We do not accept material on loan  a  Papers of alumni  faculty  administrators  or other individuals connected to VMI  if such papers have current or potential research value or if they are of significant symbolic value to the Institute  Collections documenting the military service and leadership activities of alumni are of particular interest  b  Personal papers documenting Institute history and cadet life c  Papers relating to specific aspects of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley  including the Battle of New Market  Hunter s Raid  other military engagements or activities involving the Corps of Cadets  and Stonewall Jackson  d  Other collections which relate to or

a yearbook was regularly published  1895  and on candid photographs of cadet life that do not routinely appear in official sources  d  The VMI Archives houses the Institute s rare book collection  New holdings are acquired largely through donations  C  Non print formats The same criteria  Section V  will be used for the selection of audiovisual materials and other non print media as is used for print media  scope of curricula  faculty and student needs  quality of item  and life expectancy of the item  The non print collection must complement  not conflict or compete with other library collections  Media materials over  400 will be reviewed by the librarians  Non print formats will include microfilm and microfiche  computer software  audiocassettes for the spoken word  compact discs for music  DVDs for motion video  and other emerging formats  The format selection should reflect the quality and quantity of equipment available for its utilization  Selection will be made by the Media Services Librarian who will solicit help in the evaluation process from subject specialists among the faculty  Faculty will also be encouraged to make selections within their discipline  The major areas to evaluate are  content  educational value  technical aspects  and quality of presentation  Whenever possible audiovisual materials will previewed before purchase or ordered on approval  D  Textbooks  Defined as information that is written particularly for use by students to introduce a subject  typically incorporating such characteristics as surveying or giving an overview of the subject  containing excerpts from other literary works  listing review questions at chapter endings  etc  textbooks will not ordinarily be acquired  Exceptions will be made upon specific  justified  requests  Collections A  Reference The reference collection contains encyclopedias  indexes  directories  handbooks  bibliographies  dictionaries  and other materials which are generally not meant to be read consecutively but rather to be consulted for definite items of information  These materials have historically been in print formats  Recently  however  an increasing number are becoming available electronically  The greatest concentration is placed upon those needs that arise from study and research activities directly related to the undergraduate curricula  Also  an attempt is made to acquire basic or standard reference sources which may not be directly relevant to any particular academic department or discipline at Virginia Military Institute such as materials on travel  employment  consumer information  and education  Reference materials are chosen by the Reference librarians with assistance and suggestions from library staff  faculty members  students  and others  Reference materials which are over  500 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  Decisions regarding the acquisition of materials for the reference collection are made on the basis of several criteria  The purpose of the work  Reference works are intended to be referred to or consulted  rather than read through  Relevance to the Library s needs  The Reference Department staff takes into consideration both the undergraduate curricula and past demand for information  usually made evident at the Reference desk  The authority of the work  Are the publisher and the author reputable  The scope of the work  The scope of an item should not be so narrow that a researcher is likely to need to make extensive use of it  For example  a bibliography of criticism of William Faulkner s writings should be in the main collection  while bibliographies of criticism of American literature could be in Reference  The intended audience of the work  Consider level of education  foreign language  etc  The currency of information  Though some Reference materials are  timeless  currency is important when up to date information is needed  Organization of the work  Though personal inspection previous to purchase is frequently not possible  reviews and other communications can describe the usefulness of the manner in which information is presented  Local availability of the work  Is it owned by Washington and Lee University  Price of the work  B  Government publications Preston Library is a selective depository for United States government publications  New series are selected by the Documents Librarian in consultation with library selectors and faculty  Presently these documents are controlled under the Superintendent of Documents classification and  generally  not cataloged into the collection  Specific documents are identified and fully integrated into the collection   See Appendix C for a complete statement  C  Rare books Rare is defined as follows  Old and valuable for content  binding  illustration and or printing Recent and valuable for content  illustration and or printing Some first and limited editions Fragile materials of permanent interest Published material of special interest to the Virginia Military Institute or to the local area  Rare books are housed in the VMI Archives  These books are mainly acquired as gifts  though from time to time purchases have been made for this collection  D  Timmins Music Collection The Timmins Music Collection is a memorial collection of classical music on LP phonograph records and compact disks  Additions to the collection are compact disk only and selection is made by library staff  members of the Timmins Society  and the Society s faculty advisor  Intellectual freedom The principles of intellectual freedom

Appendix A Departmental Book Allocations Appendix B Procedures and Criteria for Selection of Serial Titles Appendix C Serial Request Form Appendix D Government Publications Appendix E Selection and Deselection Assignments Purpose of the Institute Library Preston Library s collections and services exist to support the curricula offered by Virginia Military Institute  a liberal arts and engineering institution of approximately 1600 undergraduate students  to support the research interests of the faculty  and to provide materials for the pursuit of the intellectual and cultural interests of the community  Although Virginia Military Institute is primarily a teaching institution  faculty and students engage in significant research which the Library supports through such services as on line bibliographic searching  inter library loan  access to a large collection of scholarly materials online  and the selection of research level materials for the Library s collection  Faculty members are strongly urged to distinguish between a research collection and one that is designed to meet the needs of undergraduates  Relationship with other libraries Preston Library is the Institute s library and holds or provides access to VMI s library collections  The Virginia Military Institute  Washington and Lee University  and Southern Virginia University have reciprocal borrowing privileges for cadet  faculty  and staff  Resources are also shared with the Rockbridge Public Library  The Institute s Library actively participates in inter library loan programs to augment the Library s holdings  Purpose of a collection policy This document will provide guidelines for selection  descriptions of individual collections  and general information about the development and maintenance of the collections of the Institute Library  The policy is a planning device and an avenue of communication between the Library and the user community  It is hoped that a written collection policy will enable selectors to make the best possible use of finite resources  Collection development responsibilities The Institute Library has developed a strong collection to support the academic needs of faculty and cadets through the joint efforts of the faculty and the library staff  With the trend towards access over ownership  the Library s faculty and staff have increasingly built online and electronic collections  Our electronic collections have been vastly enhanced by The Virtual Library of Virginia  VIVA  which was founded in 1994  Members of the library faculty and staff have responsibility for specific subject areas  see Appendix E  and have final responsibility for additions to the collection  The Library s faculty and staff members review new requests  evaluate them against the present collection and Institute programs  and consult with the requestor about items which do not meet stated selection criteria  This procedure assumes a knowledge of the present collection  curricula  and research needs on the part of both the teaching and library faculties and a willingness of all parties to work together to achieve the fairest allocation of funds  Selection criteria In consideration of the acquisition of library materials the following points are considered  A  The support a selection gives to the curricula as stated in the catalog and usefulness to the community the library serves  B  Authority of the author  C  Reputation of the publisher  D  Timeliness or permanence of the resource  E  Quality of the writing or production  F  Accuracy of the information  G  Language of the publication  English being preferred except for programs which require foreign languages such as Modern Languages  H  Relation of the material to other resources in the collection  I  Price  both purchase price and costs of maintenance and storage  J  Availability of the same or similar material in the geographic area  especially the Washington and Lee University libraries  K  Implications for preservation  The ultimate goal is to build a collection that supports an advanced undergraduate curricula including independent study and faculty research  General Guidelines A  Foreign language publications  The Library acquires materials in the foreign languages taught at the Institute which support those courses  These materials normally include literary works  selected newspapers and magazines  dictionaries  encyclopedias  and indexes  Materials to support other courses are purchased in English  B  Retrospective purchases and out of print materials  The Library will make retrospective purchases and have the out of print market searched for essential materials which cannot be obtained in any other manner  Additional screening of such requests must include such factors as other editions held by the Library or available through the marketplace and the condition of older volumes proposed for purchase  C  Duplicates  The general library policy is to purchase one copy of a title  Requests for multiple copies are considered by the library staff selectors and selected on an individual basis  With regard to journals  when a journal becomes available online  it will replace the print edition  D  Replacement  Titles in the collection reported missing will be promptly replaced if needed for teaching or research  if they are still obtainable  Items not needed for teaching or research will be replaced on a case by case basis determined by the selection criteria  Section V  if still available  E  Gifts  Preston Library welcomes gifts and donations of useful materials  or money to purchase them  provided no restrictions are attached Donated materials become the property of the Friends of Preston Library Monetary appraisal and inventory of materials is the responsibility of the donor  Preston Library staff will evaluate gift materials for addition to library collections by the same selection criteria as purchased materials  Unneeded items such as duplicates or items that do not meet selection criteria may be sold  exchanged  donated  or discarded  F  Weeding  Periodically  the collection will be examined for material to be withdrawn  Candidates for disposal include materials which no longer support the curricula  superseded editions  unneeded duplicate copies  alternative formats  out of date text books  and materials in poor condition  Procedures may include consultation with faculty and selectors  analysis of the amount and date of circulation  available shelf space  and comparison of holdings with Washington and Lee University  Types of materials A  General collection Selection responsibility for items designation for the general collection rests upon the Library s faculty and staff  Presently  each department receives an allocation of funds based upon a formula  see Appendix A  The Library s faculty and staff review new requests and evaluate them on the basis of the present collection  Institute curricula  and selection criteria  Section V  and consult with the requestor regarding items not meeting these criteria  Monographs which cost more than  150 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  B  Special print formats 1  Serials  The Library holds subscriptions to about 250 print periodicals and 275  continuations  i e  annuals  monographic series  or sets for which the Library has a standing order  The Library also has access to over 100 000 full text scholarly journals online  Selection criteria stated in Section V apply to serials  Because serial purchases involve continuing expenditures made more critical by progressive increases  binding costs and or microform additions  requests for new subscriptions should be accompanied by sample copies of the title  which the Library will obtain  if necessary  and a written justification for the purchase including relevance to the curricula  with specific courses named  to research projects  to the Library s collection  or the needs of the Institute s community  See Appendix B  A helpful guide to the potential usefulness of a serial title is its indexing  including both print and on line indexing services  Current periodicals are usually acquired in print form  with the intention of retaining copies for binding  Back files are usually acquired in microform  Requests for new subscriptions are received by the Technical Services Librarian and reviewed by the librarians  The complete serials list is reviewed by departments every two or three years  2  Newspapers  The Library subscribes to about 20 print newspapers from different parts of the United States and foreign countries  Papers for which the Library s hold the indexes are kept permanently in microform  The microform holdings are for the indexed years with the exception of such local papers as the News Gazette  the Richmond Times Dispatch  and the Roanoke Times  Subscriptions are held for papers of regional interest those acquired primarily for the students   home town  appeal and publications of neighboring colleges  Newspaper subscriptions come under the serials budget and control systems  New subscriptions must be justified by the requestor in the same manner as any other serial subscription  Both general selection criteria  Section V  and serials selection criteria  immediately above  apply to newspaper subscriptions  3  Maps and atlases  Preston Library does not maintain a map collection as such  Local area  major city  and highway maps are acquired as needed and filed  uncataloged  in the Reference Room  The Civil Engineering Department has a map collection which is maintained and administered by that department and is not part of the Library s collection  Some maps are received from the government publications depository system  see Section VIII B  Atlases are purchased and shelved as part of the general reference collection  Older materials are located in the stacks  some items qualify for special protection and are housed in the Archives  4  Music  Purchases of sheet music or scores are subject to the general selection criteria  Section V  They are cataloged into the general collection and shelved in the stacks or with the Timmins Collection if appropriate  5  Archives  a  Official Institute Records  The Archives acquires and preserves official records that are of permanent historical or administrative value  These records include  but are not limited to  selected records of the Board of Visitors  Superintendent  and other senior administrators  Institute publications  non current student records  records that document cadet life  significant events  programs  decisions  policies  or Institute activities  and records that are defined as permanent by the Virginia State Library and Archives in its records retention schedules  VMI Record Groups are periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect organizational changes  b  Manuscripts  The department considers for acquisition manuscripts  personal papers  in the categories listed below  Final acquisition decisions are based upon many factors  if we feel that we are not the best fit for a collection  we will be happy to recommend other repositories  Manuscripts are typically acquired through donation  Except under unusual circumstances  we accept unrestricted gifts only and all material will be open to public research  We do not accept material on loan  a  Papers of alumni  faculty  administrators  or other individuals connected to VMI  if such papers have current or potential research value or if they are of significant symbolic value to the Institute  Collections documenting the military service and leadership activities of alumni are of particular interest  b  Personal papers documenting Institute history and cadet life c  Papers relating to specific aspects of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley  including the Battle of New Market  Hunter s Raid  other military engagements or activities involving the Corps of Cadets  and Stonewall Jackson  d  Other collections which relate to or complement collections held in the above categories  c  Photographs  The department actively collects images  1839   present  that document Institute history  These include photographs of individual cadets  buildings and grounds  faculty  and cadet life  We also collect images associated with the other broad areas listed under manuscripts  above  Particular emphasis is placed on the period before a yearbook was regularly published  1895  and on candid photographs of cadet life that do not routinely appear in official sources  d  The VMI Archives houses the Institute s rare book collection  New holdings are acquired largely through donations  C  Non print formats The same criteria  Section V  will be used for the selection of audiovisual materials and other non print media as is used for print media  scope of curricula  faculty and student needs  quality of item  and life expectancy of the item  The non print collection must complement  not conflict or compete with other library collections  Media materials over  400 will be reviewed by the librarians  Non print formats will include microfilm and microfiche  computer software  audiocassettes for the spoken word  compact discs for music  DVDs for motion video  and other emerging formats  The format selection should reflect the quality and quantity of equipment available for its utilization  Selection will be made by the Media Services Librarian who will solicit help in the evaluation process from subject specialists among the faculty  Faculty will also be encouraged to make selections within their discipline  The major areas to evaluate are  content  educational value  technical aspects  and quality of presentation  Whenever possible audiovisual materials will previewed before purchase or ordered on approval  D  Textbooks  Defined as information that is written particularly for use by students to introduce a subject  typically incorporating such characteristics as surveying or giving an overview of the subject  containing excerpts from other literary works  listing review questions at chapter endings  etc  textbooks will not ordinarily be acquired  Exceptions will be made upon specific  justified  requests  Collections A  Reference The reference collection contains encyclopedias  indexes  directories  handbooks  bibliographies  dictionaries  and other materials which are generally not meant to be read consecutively but rather to be consulted for definite items of information  These materials have historically been in print formats  Recently  however  an increasing number are becoming available electronically  The greatest concentration is placed upon those needs that arise from study and research activities directly related to the undergraduate curricula  Also  an attempt is made to acquire basic or standard reference sources which may not be directly relevant to any particular academic department or discipline at Virginia Military Institute such as materials on travel  employment  consumer information  and education  Reference materials are chosen by the Reference librarians with assistance and suggestions from library staff  faculty members  students  and others  Reference materials which are over  500 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  Decisions regarding the acquisition of materials for the reference collection are made on the basis of several criteria  The purpose of the work  Reference works are intended to be referred to or consulted  rather than read through  Relevance to the Library s needs  The Reference Department staff takes into consideration both the undergraduate curricula and past demand for information  usually made evident at the Reference desk  The authority of the work  Are the publisher and the author reputable  The scope of the work  The scope of an item should not be so narrow that a researcher is likely to need to make extensive use of it  For example  a bibliography of criticism of William Faulkner s writings should be in the main collection  while bibliographies of criticism of American literature could be in Reference  The intended audience of the work  Consider level of education  foreign language  etc  The currency of information  Though some Reference materials are  timeless  currency is important when up to date information is needed  Organization of the work  Though personal inspection previous to purchase is frequently not possible  reviews and other communications can describe the usefulness of the manner in which information is presented  Local availability of the work  Is it owned by Washington and Lee University  Price of the work  B  Government publications Preston Library is a selective depository for United States government publications  New series are selected by the Documents Librarian in consultation with library selectors and faculty  Presently these documents are controlled under the Superintendent of Documents classification and  generally  not cataloged into the collection  Specific documents are identified and fully integrated into the collection   See Appendix C for a complete statement  C  Rare books Rare is defined as follows  Old and valuable for content  binding  illustration and or printing Recent and valuable for content  illustration and or printing Some first and limited editions Fragile materials of permanent interest Published material of special interest to the Virginia Military Institute or to the local area  Rare books are housed in the VMI Archives  These books are mainly acquired as gifts  though from time to time purchases have been made for this collection  D  Timmins Music Collection The Timmins Music Collection is a memorial collection of classical music on LP phonograph records and compact disks  Additions to the collection are compact disk only and selection is made by library staff  members of the Timmins Society  and the Society s faculty advisor  Intellectual freedom The principles of intellectual freedom as outlined in the Library Bill of Rights of the American Library Association will be adhered to in the selection of library materials  It is the responsibility of the librarians and faculty selecting materials to ensure that all points of view are represented in the collection and that materials are not removed from the collection because of partisan or doctrinal disapproval  Copyright The Virginia Military Institute Library

Appendix A Departmental Book Allocations Appendix B Procedures and Criteria for Selection of Serial Titles Appendix C Serial Request Form Appendix D Government Publications Appendix E Selection and Deselection Assignments Purpose of the Institute Library Preston Library s collections and services exist to support the curricula offered by Virginia Military Institute  a liberal arts and engineering institution of approximately 1600 undergraduate students  to support the research interests of the faculty  and to provide materials for the pursuit of the intellectual and cultural interests of the community  Although Virginia Military Institute is primarily a teaching institution  faculty and students engage in significant research which the Library supports through such services as on line bibliographic searching  inter library loan  access to a large collection of scholarly materials online  and the selection of research level materials for the Library s collection  Faculty members are strongly urged to distinguish between a research collection and one that is designed to meet the needs of undergraduates  Relationship with other libraries Preston Library is the Institute s library and holds or provides access to VMI s library collections  The Virginia Military Institute  Washington and Lee University  and Southern Virginia University have reciprocal borrowing privileges for cadet  faculty  and staff  Resources are also shared with the Rockbridge Public Library  The Institute s Library actively participates in inter library loan programs to augment the Library s holdings  Purpose of a collection policy This document will provide guidelines for selection  descriptions of individual collections  and general information about the development and maintenance of the collections of the Institute Library  The policy is a planning device and an avenue of communication between the Library and the user community  It is hoped that a written collection policy will enable selectors to make the best possible use of finite resources  Collection development responsibilities The Institute Library has developed a strong collection to support the academic needs of faculty and cadets through the joint efforts of the faculty and the library staff  With the trend towards access over ownership  the Library s faculty and staff have increasingly built online and electronic collections  Our electronic collections have been vastly enhanced by The Virtual Library of Virginia  VIVA  which was founded in 1994  Members of the library faculty and staff have responsibility for specific subject areas  see Appendix E  and have final responsibility for additions to the collection  The Library s faculty and staff members review new requests  evaluate them against the present collection and Institute programs  and consult with the requestor about items which do not meet stated selection criteria  This procedure assumes a knowledge of the present collection  curricula  and research needs on the part of both the teaching and library faculties and a willingness of all parties to work together to achieve the fairest allocation of funds  Selection criteria In consideration of the acquisition of library materials the following points are considered  A  The support a selection gives to the curricula as stated in the catalog and usefulness to the community the library serves  B  Authority of the author  C  Reputation of the publisher  D  Timeliness or permanence of the resource  E  Quality of the writing or production  F  Accuracy of the information  G  Language of the publication  English being preferred except for programs which require foreign languages such as Modern Languages  H  Relation of the material to other resources in the collection  I  Price  both purchase price and costs of maintenance and storage  J  Availability of the same or similar material in the geographic area  especially the Washington and Lee University libraries  K  Implications for preservation  The ultimate goal is to build a collection that supports an advanced undergraduate curricula including independent study and faculty research  General Guidelines A  Foreign language publications  The Library acquires materials in the foreign languages taught at the Institute which support those courses  These materials normally include literary works  selected newspapers and magazines  dictionaries  encyclopedias  and indexes  Materials to support other courses are purchased in English  B  Retrospective purchases and out of print materials  The Library will make retrospective purchases and have the out of print market searched for essential materials which cannot be obtained in any other manner  Additional screening of such requests must include such factors as other editions held by the Library or available through the marketplace and the condition of older volumes proposed for purchase  C  Duplicates  The general library policy is to purchase one copy of a title  Requests for multiple copies are considered by the library staff selectors and selected on an individual basis  With regard to journals  when a journal becomes available online  it will replace the print edition  D  Replacement  Titles in the collection reported missing will be promptly replaced if needed for teaching or research  if they are still obtainable  Items not needed for teaching or research will be replaced on a case by case basis determined by the selection criteria  Section V  if still available  E  Gifts  Preston Library welcomes gifts and donations of useful materials  or money to purchase them  provided no restrictions are attached Donated materials become the property of the Friends of Preston Library Monetary appraisal and inventory of materials is the responsibility of the donor  Preston Library staff will evaluate gift materials for addition to library collections by the same selection criteria as purchased materials  Unneeded items such as duplicates or items that do not meet selection criteria may be sold  exchanged  donated  or discarded  F  Weeding  Periodically  the collection will be examined for material to be withdrawn  Candidates for disposal include materials which no longer support the curricula  superseded editions  unneeded duplicate copies  alternative formats  out of date text books  and materials in poor condition  Procedures may include consultation with faculty and selectors  analysis of the amount and date of circulation  available shelf space  and comparison of holdings with Washington and Lee University  Types of materials A  General collection Selection responsibility for items designation for the general collection rests upon the Library s faculty and staff  Presently  each department receives an allocation of funds based upon a formula  see Appendix A  The Library s faculty and staff review new requests and evaluate them on the basis of the present collection  Institute curricula  and selection criteria  Section V  and consult with the requestor regarding items not meeting these criteria  Monographs which cost more than  150 00 will be reviewed by the librarians  B  Special print formats 1  Serials  The Library holds subscriptions to about 250 print periodicals and 275  continuations  i e  annuals  monographic series  or sets for which the Library has a standing order  The Library also has access to over 100 000 full text scholarly journals online  Selection criteria stated in Section V apply to serials  Because serial purchases involve continuing expenditures made more critical by progressive increases  binding costs and or microform additions  requests for new subscriptions should be accompanied by sample copies of the title  which the Library will obtain  if necessary  and a written justification for the purchase including relevance to the curricula  with specific courses named  to research projects  to the Library s collection  or the needs of the Institute s community  See Appendix B  A helpful guide to the potential usefulness of a serial title is its indexing  including both print and on line indexing services  Current periodicals are usually acquired in print form  with the intention of retaining copies for binding  Back files are usually acquired in microform  Requests for new subscriptions are received by the Technical Services Librarian and reviewed by the librarians  The complete serials list is reviewed by departments every two or three years  2  Newspapers  The Library subscribes to about 20 print newspapers from different parts of the United States and foreign countries  Papers for which the Library s hold the indexes are kept permanently in microform  The microform holdings are for the indexed years with the exception of such local papers as the News Gazette  the Richmond Times Dispatch  and the Roanoke Times  Subscriptions are held for papers of regional interest those acquired primarily for the students   home town  appeal and publications of neighboring colleges  Newspaper subscriptions come under the serials budget and control systems  New subscriptions must be justified by the requestor in the same manner as any other serial subscription  Both general selection criteria  Section V  and serials selection criteria  immediately above  apply to newspaper subscriptions  3  Maps and atlases  Preston Library does not maintain a map collection as such  Local area  major city  and highway maps are acquired as needed and filed  uncataloged  in the Reference Room  The Civil Engineering Department has a map collection which is maintained and administered by that department and is not part of the Library s collection  Some maps are received from the government publications depository system  see Section VIII B  Atlases are purchased and shelved as part of the general reference collection  Older materials are located in the stacks  some items qualify for special protection and are housed in the Archives  4  Music  Purchases of sheet music or scores are subject to the general selection criteria  Section V  They are cataloged into the general collection and shelved in the stacks or with the Timmins Collection if appropriate  5  Archives  a  Official Institute Records  The Archives acquires and preserves official records that are of permanent historical or administrative value  These records include  but are not limited to  selected records of the Board of Visitors  Superintendent  and other senior administrators  Institute publications  non current student records  records that document cadet life  significant events  programs  decisions  policies  or Institute activities  and records that are defined as permanent by the Virginia State Library and Archives in its records retention schedules  VMI Record Groups are periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect organizational changes  b  Manuscripts  The department considers for acquisition manuscripts  personal papers  in the categories listed below  Final acquisition decisions are based upon many factors  if we feel that we are not the best fit for a collection  we will be happy to recommend other repositories  Manuscripts are typically acquired through donation  Except under unusual circumstances  we accept unrestricted gifts only and all material will be open to public research  We do not accept material on loan  a  Papers of alumni  faculty  administrators  or other individuals connected to VMI  if such papers have current or potential research value or if they are of significant symbolic value to the Institute  Collections documenting the military service and leadership activities of alumni are of particular interest  b  Personal papers documenting Institute history and cadet life c  Papers relating to specific aspects of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley  including the Battle of New Market  Hunter s Raid  other military engagements or activities involving the Corps of Cadets  and Stonewall Jackson  d  Other collections which relate to or complement collections held in the above categories  c  Photographs  The department actively collects images  1839   present  that document Institute history  These include photographs of individual cadets  buildings and grounds  faculty  and cadet life  We also collect images associated with the other broad areas listed under manuscripts  above  Particular emphasis is placed on the period before a yearbook was regularly published

the Institute Library Purpose of the Institute Library  Preston Library s collections and services exist to support the curricula offered by Virginia Military Institute  a liberal arts and engineering institution of approximately 1600 undergraduate students  to support the research interests of the faculty  and to provide materials for the pursuit of the intellectual and cultural interests of the community Although Virginia Military Institute is primarily a teaching institution  faculty and students engage in significant research which the Library supports through such services as on line bibliographic searching  inter library loan  access to a large collection of scholarly materials online  and the selection of research level materials for the Library s collection Faculty members are strongly urged to distinguish between a research collection and one that is designed to meet the needs of undergraduates Relationship with other libraries Relationship with other libraries Relationship with other libraries  Preston Library is the Institute s library and holds or provides access to VMI s library collections  The Virginia Military Institute  Washington and Lee University  and Southern Virginia University have reciprocal borrowing privileges for cadet  faculty  and staff  Resources are also shared with the Rockbridge Public Library  The Institute s Library actively participates in inter library loan programs to augment the Library s holdings Purpose of a collection policy Purpose of a collection policy Purpose of a collection policy  This document will provide guidelines for selection  descriptions of individual collections  and general information about the development and maintenance of the collections of the Institute Library  The policy is a planning device and an avenue of communication between the Library and the user community  It is hoped that a written collection policy will enable selectors to make the best possible use of finite resources Collection development responsibilities Collection development responsibilities Collection development responsibilities  The Institute Library has developed a strong collection to support the academic needs of faculty and cadets through the joint efforts of the faculty and the library staff  With the trend towards access over ownership  the Library s faculty and staff have increasingly built online and electronic collections  Our electronic collections have been vastly enhanced by The Virtual Library of Virginia  VIVA  which was founded in 1994  Members of the library faculty and staff have responsibility for specific subject areas  see Appendix E  and have final responsibility for additions to the collection  The Library s faculty and staff members review new requests  evaluate them against the present collection and Institute programs  and consult with the requestor about items which do not meet stated selection criteria  This procedure assumes a knowledge of the present collection  curricula  and research needs on the part of both the teaching and library faculties and a willingness of all parties to work together to achieve the fairest allocation of funds Selection criteria Selection criteria Selection criteria  In consideration of the acquisition of library materials the following points are considered A  The support a selection gives to the curricula as stated in the catalog and usefulness to the community the library serves B  Authority of the author C  Reputation of the publisher D  Timeliness or permanence of the resource E  Quality of the writing or production F  Accuracy of the information G  Language of the publication  English being preferred except for programs which require foreign languages such as Modern Languages H  Relation of the material to other resources in the collection I  Price  both purchase price and costs of maintenance and storage J  Availability of the same or similar material in the geographic area  especially the Washington and Lee University libraries K  Implications for preservation The ultimate goal is to build a collection that supports an advanced undergraduate curricula including independent study and faculty research General Guidelines General Guidelines General Guidelines  A  Foreign language publications  The Library acquires materials in the foreign languages taught at the Institute which support those courses  These materials normally include literary works  selected newspapers and magazines  dictionaries  encyclopedias  and indexes  Materials to support other courses are purchased in English B  Retrospective purchases and out of print materials  The Library will make retrospective purchases and have the out of print market searched for essential materials which cannot be obtained in any other manner  Additional screening of such requests must include such factors as other editions held by the Library or available through the marketplace and the condition of older volumes proposed for purchase C  Duplicates  The general library policy is to purchase one copy of a title  Requests for multiple copies are considered by the library staff selectors and selected on an individual basis  With regard to journals  when a journal becomes available online  it will replace the print edition D  Replacement  Titles in the collection reported missing will be promptly replaced if needed for teaching or research  if they are still obtainable  Items not needed for teaching or research will be replaced on a case by case basis determined by the selection criteria  Section V  if still available E  Gifts  Preston Library welcomes gifts and donations of useful materials  or money to purchase them  provided no restrictions are attached Donated materials become the property of the Friends of Preston Library Monetary appraisal and inventory of materials is the responsibility of the donor  Preston Library staff will evaluate gift materials for addition to library collections by the same selection criteria as purchased materials  Unneeded items such as duplicates or items that do not meet selection criteria may be sold  exchanged  donated  or discarded F  Weeding  Periodically  the collection will be examined for material to be withdrawn  Candidates for disposal include materials which no longer support the curricula  superseded editions  unneeded duplicate copies  alternative formats  out of date text books  and materials in poor condition  Procedures may include consultation with faculty and selectors  analysis of the amount and date of circulation  available shelf space  and comparison of holdings with Washington and Lee University Types of materials Types of materials Types of materials  A  General collection Selection responsibility for items designation for the general collection rests upon the Library s faculty and staff  Presently  each department receives an allocation of funds based upon a formula  see Appendix A  The Library s faculty and staff review new requests and evaluate them on the basis of the present collection  Institute curricula  and selection criteria  Section V  and consult with the requestor regarding items not meeting these criteria  Monographs which cost more than  150 00 will be reviewed by the librarians B  Special print formats 1  Serials  The Library holds subscriptions to about 250 print periodicals and 275  continuations  i e  annuals  monographic series  or sets for which the Library has a standing order  The Library also has access to over 100 000 full text scholarly journals online  Selection criteria stated in Section V apply to serials  Because serial purchases involve continuing expenditures made more critical by progressive increases  binding costs and or microform additions  requests for new subscriptions should be accompanied by sample copies of the title  which the Library will obtain  if necessary  and a written justification for the purchase including relevance to the curricula  with specific courses named  to research projects  to the Library s collection  or the needs of the Institute s community  See Appendix B  A helpful guide to the potential usefulness of a serial title is its indexing  including both print and on line indexing services  Current periodicals are usually acquired in print form  with the intention of retaining copies for binding  Back files are usually acquired in microform  Requests for new subscriptions are received by the Technical Services Librarian and reviewed by the librarians The complete serials list is reviewed by departments every two or three years 2  Newspapers  The Library subscribes to about 20 print newspapers from different parts of the United States and foreign countries  Papers for which the Library s hold the indexes are kept permanently in microform  The microform holdings are for the indexed years with the exception of such local papers as the News Gazette  the Richmond Times Dispatch  and the Roanoke Times  Subscriptions are held for papers of regional interest those acquired primarily for the students   home town  appeal and publications of neighboring colleges  Newspaper subscriptions come under the serials budget and control systems  New subscriptions must be justified by the requestor in the same manner as any other serial subscription  Both general selection criteria  Section V  and serials selection criteria  immediately above  apply to newspaper subscriptions 3  Maps and atlases  Preston Library does not maintain a map collection as such  Local area  major city  and highway maps are acquired as needed and filed  uncataloged  in the Reference Room  The Civil Engineering Department has a map collection which is maintained and administered by that department and is not part of the Library s collection  Some maps are received from the government publications depository system  see Section VIII B Atlases are purchased and shelved as part of the general reference collection  Older materials are located in the stacks  some items qualify for special protection and are housed in the Archives 4  Music  Purchases of sheet music or scores are subject to the general selection criteria  Section V  They are cataloged into the general collection and shelved in the stacks or with the Timmins Collection if appropriate 5  Archives a  Official Institute Records  The Archives acquires and preserves official records that are of permanent historical or administrative value  These records include  but are not limited to  selected records of the Board of Visitors  Superintendent  and other senior administrators  Institute publications  non current student records  records that document cadet life  significant events  programs  decisions  policies  or Institute activities  and records that are defined as permanent by the Virginia State Library and Archives in its records retention schedules  VMI Record Groups are periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to reflect organizational changes b  Manuscripts  The department considers for acquisition manuscripts  personal papers  in the categories listed below  Final acquisition decisions are based upon many factors  if we feel that we are not the best fit for a collection  we will be happy to recommend other repositories  Manuscripts are typically acquired through donation  Except under unusual circumstances  we accept unrestricted gifts only and all material will be open to public research  We do not accept material on loan a  Papers of alumni  faculty  administrators  or other individuals connected to VMI  if such papers have current or potential research value or if they are of significant symbolic value to the Institute  Collections documenting the military service and leadership activities of alumni are of particular interest  b  Personal papers documenting Institute history and cadet life c  Papers relating to specific aspects of the Civil War in the Shenandoah Valley  including the Battle of New Market  Hunter s Raid  other military engagements or activities involving the Corps of Cadets  and Stonewall Jackson  d  Other collections which relate to or complement collections held in the above categories a  Papers of alumni  faculty  administrators  or other individuals connected to VMI  if such papers have current or potential

These include photographs of individual cadets  buildings and grounds  faculty  and cadet life  We also collect images associated with the other broad areas listed under manuscripts  above  Particular emphasis is placed on the period before a yearbook was regularly published  1895  and on candid photographs of cadet life that do not routinely appear in official sources d  The VMI Archives houses the Institute s rare book collection  New holdings are acquired largely through donations C  Non print formats The same criteria  Section V  will be used for the selection of audiovisual materials and other non print media as is used for print media  scope of curricula  faculty and student needs  quality of item  and life expectancy of the item  The non print collection must complement  not conflict or compete with other library collections  Media materials over  400 will be reviewed by the librarians Non print formats will include microfilm and microfiche  computer software  audiocassettes for the spoken word  compact discs for music  DVDs for motion video  and other emerging formats  The format selection should reflect the quality and quantity of equipment available for its utilization Selection will be made by the Media Services Librarian who will solicit help in the evaluation process from subject specialists among the faculty  Faculty will also be encouraged to make selections within their discipline  The major areas to evaluate are  content  educational value  technical aspects  and quality of presentation  Whenever possible audiovisual materials will previewed before purchase or ordered on approval D  Textbooks  Defined as information that is written particularly for use by students to introduce a subject  typically incorporating such characteristics as surveying or giving an overview of the subject  containing excerpts from other literary works  listing review questions at chapter endings  etc  textbooks will not ordinarily be acquired  Exceptions will be made upon specific  justified  requests Collections Collections Collections  A  Reference The reference collection contains encyclopedias  indexes  directories  handbooks  bibliographies  dictionaries  and other materials which are generally not meant to be read consecutively but rather to be consulted for definite items of information  These materials have historically been in print formats  Recently  however  an increasing number are becoming available electronically  The greatest concentration is placed upon those needs that arise from study and research activities directly related to the undergraduate curricula  Also  an attempt is made to acquire basic or standard reference sources which may not be directly relevant to any particular academic department or discipline at Virginia Military Institute such as materials on travel  employment  consumer information  and education  Reference materials are chosen by the Reference librarians with assistance and suggestions from library staff  faculty members  students  and others  Reference materials which are over  500 00 will be reviewed by the librarians Decisions regarding the acquisition of materials for the reference collection are made on the basis of several criteria The purpose of the work  Reference works are intended to be referred to or consulted  rather than read through  Relevance to the Library s needs  The Reference Department staff takes into consideration both the undergraduate curricula and past demand for information  usually made evident at the Reference desk  The authority of the work  Are the publisher and the author reputable  The scope of the work  The scope of an item should not be so narrow that a researcher is likely to need to make extensive use of it  For example  a bibliography of criticism of William Faulkner s writings should be in the main collection  while bibliographies of criticism of American literature could be in Reference  The intended audience of the work  Consider level of education  foreign language  etc  The currency of information  Though some Reference materials are  timeless  currency is important when up to date
