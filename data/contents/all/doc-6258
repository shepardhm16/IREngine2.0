Speak on  Alcatraz Eleven  LEXINGTON  Va  Feb  21  2014   They communicated through walls using a  tap  code  They passed notes when they could  This is how the  Alcatraz Eleven    the most influential and subversive American POWs in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War   communicated  And that communication was part of how they survived  It is their story  and that of the families who fought for them back home  that was the subject of a talk last night in VMI s Gillis Theater by Alvin Townley  author of Defiant  The POWs Who Endured Vietnam s Most Infamous Prison  The Women Who Fought for Them  and the One Who Never Returned  His talk was sponsored by the VMI Leadership Book Program  Townley was accompanied by retired Rear Admiral Robert Shumaker  an eight year prisoner of war eventually banished to North Vietnam s  Alcatraz  prison  and Michael Denton  81  son of former POW then Navy Cmdr  Jeremiah Denton  VMI alumnus and retired Air Force Lt  Col  James Berger  61  also a former prisoner of war in North Vietnam  was in the audience  Defiant chronicles the stories of 11 American POWs in North Vietnam  all at some point imprisoned at an isolated compound that became known as  Alcatraz  The  Alcatraz Eleven  endured years of torture  starvation  and isolation   That was probably the worst assignment any POW received  Townley told the audience of cadets  faculty  staff  and area residents  Yet throughout the almost unimaginable circumstances  the men found ways to stay united and support each other   They had no choice  they had to survive and they had to support each other  and that s what they did  said Townley  While the men were being held  their families at home were also coming together in support  at first following the government s orders to remain quiet about their loved ones but later rallying for action on behalf of their husbands and fathers   They started a nationwide and eventually a worldwide movement to improve the treatment of POWs    This was actually one of the greatest women s movements in American history  noted Townley   It tells an incredible story about how these women mobilized the country on behalf of their husbands  Welcomed by a standing ovation  Shumaker described his own experiences at Alcatraz  including teaching a fellow captive French by tapping out five words a day  Shumaker was the second American taken as a prisoner of war in North Vietnam  shot down and captured in February 1965 while flying an F 8 Crusader  He retired from the Navy in 1989  with military decorations including the Distinguished Service Medal  Silver Star  2  Legion of Merit  4  Distinguished Flying Cross  Bronze Star  and Purple Heart  2  Shumaker also addressed what he learned from his imprisonment  including a need for a good sense of humor  communication with others in times of stress  and never losing faith in the people or government of the United States of America   What you learn from that experience is what a wonderful country we belong to  he said   a country that never forgot us  VMI Regimental Adjutant Cadet Benjamin Kier  14 sees the opportunity to learn from speakers such as Shumaker as part of the distinctive education of Virginia Military Institute   There are very few colleges in the country at which being part of a book program would grant you the opportunity to have dinner with one of the most defiant POWs in North Vietnam  said Kier   I attended this event because I felt like as a future second lieutenant in the Army it is important for me to be aware of the possible dangers I might face and how to face them honorably  as Rear Admiral Shumaker did  The Leadership Book Program is a cadet led program  sponsored by the Center for Leadership and Ethics  that encourages reading and discussion on leadership topics  Prior to the presentations Townley and Shumaker joined cadets of the program for a tour of post and dinner in Crozet Hall   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
