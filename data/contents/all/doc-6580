SURI Project Pursues Cure for Malaria A project currently under way in the VMI chemistry department could someday save lives that would otherwise be lost to malaria  Beginning last year  Col  Stan Smith  professor of chemistry  and several cadets have been working to develop new compounds effective against malaria  a mosquito borne  sometimes fatal disease common in tropical regions of the world  The disease is caused by a parasitic protozoan carried by the female Anopheles mosquito  which transmits the infection when it bites a person or animal  There are anti malarial pharmaceuticals currently on the market  but resistance has developed to several of them  Smith explained  There is no vaccine against the disease  Last summer  Cadet Brent Clark  15 spent many hours in the lab working to develop and test new compounds that might be effective against malaria as part of a Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project  For Clark  a chemistry major who plans to commission in the Air Force after graduating from VMI  the SURI project has been a way to experience the real life of a scientist  with all of its joys and frustrations   Some things have been easy and some things have been hard  said Clark   The things that we re currently trying aren t working  but that s science  I guess  We re just trying to get stuff to work  Testing the efficacy of Clark and Smith s creations has been left to the experts at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research  where a VMI alumnus  Capt  Victor Zottig  01  is chief of the synthetic chemistry core in the division of experimental therapeutics  In that role  he is responsible for helping to develop new drugs against malaria  The involvement of Clark and Smith in Zottig s research is the result of VMI s famed alumni network   and a bit of serendipity  Zottig attended graduate school with a fellow alumnus  Maj  Dan Harrison  05  who is now assistant professor of chemistry  Over the years  Harrison and Zottig have kept in touch  and when Zottig expressed an interest in having an organic chemist develop and test anti malarial compounds  Harrison recommended Smith  Smith came to the project with a background in medicinal chemistry  as he had done research to find a way to chemically inactivate nerve gas agents during a post doctoral fellowship at the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina  As they completed the synthesis and purification of new compounds  Smith and Clark sent a sample of each to Zottig at Walter Reed  Two months later  Smith receives results showing what worked and what didn t and then heads back to the lab to further refine the compounds showing the best results   We ve found things that are semi active  said Smith of the research results so far   It s trial and error  added Clark   We have some compounds that aren t toxic  so that s good  but they re not nearly as active as the drugs that are used now  Smith explained   The drugs that are used now are probably about 1 000 to 10 000 times more active than our compounds  so there s still a ways to go  Some of the compounds show promise  so the ones that show promise  we re making more derivatives of those  Clark  meanwhile  has found satisfaction in knowing that if he is persistent enough  he could help produce a powerful drug   It s exciting to know that what I m doing here could potentially help save people  said Clark   It s kind of exciting but nerve racking  especially when we get something that should work but doesn t work  because if we could get it to work  it could be that one thing they need  he continued   I ve just got to keep pushing  It s kind of exciting knowing that something that I m doing here could affect somebody eventually  Also working on this project with Smith during the 2013 14 academic year were Thomas Bradshaw  14  Zachary Ratka  14  and Ryan Miccio  16  By  Mary Price IR   Oct  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES

Academics   Areas of Study   Natural Science   Mathematics   Chemistry   Project Pursues Cure for Malaria Cadet SURI Project Pursues Cure for Malaria A project currently under way in the VMI chemistry department could someday save lives that would otherwise be lost to malaria  Beginning last year  Col  Stan Smith  professor of chemistry  and several cadets have been working to develop new compounds effective against malaria  a mosquito borne  sometimes fatal disease common in tropical regions of the world  The disease is caused by a parasitic protozoan carried by the female Anopheles mosquito  which transmits the infection when it bites a person or animal  There are anti malarial pharmaceuticals currently on the market  but resistance has developed to several of them  Smith explained  There is no vaccine against the disease  Last summer  Cadet Brent Clark  15 spent many hours in the lab working to develop and test new compounds that might be effective against malaria as part of a Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project  For Clark  a chemistry major who plans to commission in the Air Force after graduating from VMI  the SURI project has been a way to experience the real life of a scientist  with all of its joys and frustrations   Some things have been easy and some things have been hard  said Clark   The things that we re currently trying aren t working  but that s science  I guess  We re just trying to get stuff to work  Testing the efficacy of Clark and Smith s creations has been left to the experts at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research  where a VMI alumnus  Capt  Victor Zottig  01  is chief of the synthetic chemistry core in the division of experimental therapeutics  In that role  he is responsible for helping to develop new drugs against malaria  The involvement of Clark and Smith in Zottig s research is the result of VMI s famed alumni network   and a bit of serendipity  Zottig attended graduate school with a fellow alumnus  Maj  Dan Harrison  05  who is now assistant professor of chemistry  Over the years  Harrison and Zottig have kept in touch  and when Zottig expressed an interest in having an organic chemist develop and test anti malarial compounds  Harrison recommended Smith  Smith came to the project with a background in medicinal chemistry  as he had done research to find a way to chemically inactivate nerve gas agents during a post doctoral fellowship at the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina  As they completed the synthesis and purification of new compounds  Smith and Clark sent a sample of each to Zottig at Walter Reed  Two months later  Smith receives results showing what worked and what didn t and then heads back to the lab to further refine the compounds showing the best results   We ve found things that are semi active  said Smith of the research results so far   It s trial and error  added Clark   We have some compounds that aren t toxic  so that s good  but they re not nearly as active as the drugs that are used now  Smith explained   The drugs that are used now are probably about 1 000 to 10 000 times more active than our compounds  so there s still a ways to go  Some of the compounds show promise  so the ones that show promise  we re making more derivatives of those  Clark  meanwhile  has found satisfaction in knowing that if he is persistent enough  he could help produce a powerful drug   It s exciting to know that what I m doing here could potentially help save people  said Clark   It s kind of exciting but nerve racking  especially when we get something that should work but doesn t work  because if we could get it to work  it could be that one thing they need  he continued   I ve just got to keep pushing  It s kind of exciting knowing that something that I m doing here could affect somebody eventually  Also working on this project with Smith during the 2013 14 academic year were Thomas Bradshaw  14  Zachary Ratka  14  and Ryan Miccio  16  By  Mary
