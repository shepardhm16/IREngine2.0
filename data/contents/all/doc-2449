offering cadets a chance to examine the process of invention hands on as they explore breakthroughs that changed the world  The course  which satisfies the civilizations and cultures core curriculum requirement  combines discussion  reflective essays  and experiential activities to explore technologies and their influence on cultures   I want them to get the general ideas and the sense of adventure that comes with discovery  said Col  Wayne Neel  professor of mechanical engineering  Demonstrations of technologies such as bronze casting and the pinhole camera offer cadets a new way to look at the past  Neel has reverse engineered several ancient and medieval siege weapons  in which the cadets took a particular interest  and he recently created a phonograph with which he demonstrated how vibrations caused by sound can etch a revolving cylinder  The course  offered each fall semester  is always evolving as Neel finds new ways to demonstrate technologies   We re doing a lot of experiential work  and every year I add new things  said Neel   I plan out these demonstrations  but regular classroom time is a pretty free ranging discussion  Cadets ask questions  and it takes us in different directions  The course focuses on five areas of technology that have had a significant impact on society  They include materials  transportation  power  machines  and communications  Within those categories  students are encouraged to explore technologies that they find compelling through the writing assignments   We   relooking at the development of technologies in these five fields  and I m trying to make it fun for them so they come away from the course with the idea that there s a lot of history behind our technology  said Neel   They can go back and find out the origin of some of the things they re interested in  In addition to exploring these technologies  the assignments give the cadets a chance to hone their writing skills   Writing is very important for engineers  said Neel   They ll be writing throughout their careers  so it s vital that they have that skill  Neel is also utilizing video demonstrations of technologies to explain their development and refinement   There are a lot of video demonstrations that I show in class that we can t recreate here  said Neel   The Internet has made that a lot easier  Neel is highlighting the painstaking nature of technological development and circuitous path that invention often takes   Invention isn t just one guy who gets an idea and says  eureka  said Neel   A lot of things that people tried at the beginning didn t work  but those early failures laid a foundation for useful  technologies  By  John Robertson IV IR   Dec  2103 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My
