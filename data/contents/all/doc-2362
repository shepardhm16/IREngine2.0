Sixteen cadets  all 1st and 2nd class cadets majoring in economics and business  are enrolled this fall  Within the field of economics  Dimitrova Grajzl said  institutions are defined as  the combination of formal rules  laws  political systems  informal constraints  religious beliefs  norms or more broadly what we refer to as culture  and organizations that together affect economic behavior  Together  she explained  these forces create the  rules of the game  or the framework within which economic activity must be conducted  In class  Dimitrova Grajzl encourages her students to explore questions such as why taking one country s laws  for example  and using them in another country might not spur economic activity   Sometimes the rules will not make sense in the context of the culture  she said  Other topics include corruption and bribes  the role of religion in economic growth  and the relationship between a country s colonial origins and its present pattern of economic activity  In lieu of a final exam  cadets are required to produce a research paper in the area of institutional economics  To prepare for this  Dimitrova Grajzl s students read papers written by

ECBU Curriculum New Class  New Grant Enhance ECBU Curriculum  This fall has brought changes to the Department of Economics and Business  with one new class being offered as part of the department s new global management concentration and an existing class incorporating undergraduate research for the first time through funding from a Jackson Hope grant  The new class  Institutions and Economic Development  taught by Maj  Valentina Dimitrova Grajzl  is designed to help cadets understand how the complex interplay of laws and social systems affects a nation s economic development  Sixteen cadets  all 1st and 2nd class cadets majoring in economics and business  are enrolled this fall  Within the field of economics  Dimitrova Grajzl said  institutions are defined as  the combination of formal rules  laws  political systems  informal constraints  religious beliefs  norms or more broadly what we refer to as culture  and organizations that together affect economic behavior  Together  she explained  these forces create the  rules of the game  or the framework within which economic activity must be conducted  In class  Dimitrova Grajzl encourages her students to explore questions such as why taking one country s laws  for example  and using them in another country might not spur economic activity   Sometimes the rules will not make sense in the context of the culture  she said  Other topics include corruption and bribes  the role of religion in economic growth  and the relationship between a country s colonial origins and its present pattern of economic activity  In lieu of a final exam  cadets are required to produce a research paper in the area of institutional economics  To prepare for this  Dimitrova Grajzl s students read papers written by working economists and published in professional journals  Dimitrova Grajzl also schedules computer lab time so cadets can use an econometrics software program  and she requires that they visit the Institute s Writing Center for help with their papers   I m really trying to take all the foundation that all of their other classes have taught them and apply it  said Dimitrova Grajzl   I want them to see how it s actually extended to an application of all the theory  Dimitrova Grajzl s colleague  Col  Tinni Sen is teaching an existing class with a new twist   writing intensive International Finance  This year  thanks to a grant Sen received from the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  students have been allowed to pick a country and write short papers about the various aspects of international finance in that country  At the end of the semester  the cadets will compile that information into a long paper  Previously  all paper topics in the course were assigned by Sen  so the topics were much less open ended   I want them outside their comfort zone  said Sen of the move to require more independent research by the cadets  With that goal in mind  Sen asked her students to choose a country that they knew little about  but one for which good economic data is available  In the end  cadet choices included Israel  Brazil  China  Argentina  and Russia   My guess is that it s going to be a harder class than it has been in the past but it s also going to be more interesting because they re going to take ownership of the country  said Sen  That ownership  she hopes  will translate into a deeper interest and a correspondingly deeper level of learning   When they walk out of class I want them to spend some time voluntarily thinking about what they re learning in class  she said   This is one way that I m hoping that even when they re not sitting and researching the paper  there ll be topics in the news and their ears will prick up   Oh  it s my country  The grant that Sen received  Integrating Research into the Curriculum  is supported by VMI s Jackson Hope Fund  said Maj  Megan Newman  director of VCUR  She explained that the goal of these grants is to provide faculty with additional funds for curriculum development  a process that can be costly in terms of both time and money  Each grant is usually worth  2 000  said Newman   It gives  the faculty member  a chance to explore what kind of program  initiative  etc  would be best for their class and their discipline  Newman noted   The grants  are intended to foster the integration of undergraduate research and related inquiry based methods of teaching and learning into cadets  academic coursework at VMI  said Lt  Col  Keith Kline  associate professor of psychology  who was director of undergraduate research at VMI three years ago when the grants were developed  In addition to Sen  other faculty members receiving Integrating Research into the Curriculum grants this year were Maj  John David and Maj  Randy
