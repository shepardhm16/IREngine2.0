LEXINGTON  Va  Aug 7  2013   A Waynesboro  Va  nonprofit organization that provides supported employment for adults with disabilities has had its record keeping and accounting processes sped up dramatically thanks to the efforts of Cadet Alex Lin  15  Lin  an applied mathematics major  is one of six cadets participating in VMI s Applied and Industrial Mathematics program this summer  The program began last year under the name REMACS  which stood for Research Experiences in Mathematics and Computer Science  Lin s project for Vector Industries has involved automating several time consuming tasks related to accounting  payroll  and transportation  Lin explained that one of Vector s main challenges had been putting together financial reports for its board of directors on a monthly basis  Using the computer language Visual Basic  Lin was able to automate the process of importing the financial records so information for the board could be made available with the click of a button   Previously  they had to copy and paste all of their stuff  explained Lin   The data analysis was really slow and inefficient  A second task that Lin tackled for Vector had to do with determining how much employees are paid  Because Vector s employees have disabilities  they are not required to be paid minimum wage under the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act  Rather  they are paid on a piecework basis  Lin explained that prior to his automation of the process  determining how much each individual should be paid was a cumbersome process that involved Vector s operations and engineering analyst taking a  snapshot  of time worked and pieces produced from six randomly selected weeks over the previous six months  Because Vector has over 100 employees  Lin continued  this meant the analyst was poring over 600 pieces of data at a time  That was difficult enough   but Lin was quick to note that tracking down and correcting human error made the process even more time consuming   A lot of times there are red flags from either employees entering the wrong amount of hours or entering the wrong amount of production parts they re produced  Lin said  Before Lin s computer program made its debut  conducting performance evaluations and resetting wages at Vector took two or three days of the operations and engineering analyst s time  Now  those tasks are accomplished in a matter of minutes  Lin s third task for Vector has built upon work done in the REMACS program last summer  In 2012  Cadet Alex Falcetti  14 developed a computer program for Valley Program for Aging Services to use in routing its Meals on Wheels delivery system for homebound seniors  so VPAS could deliver the meals in the most efficient manner possible  Lin took Falcetti s work and used it as a starting point to solve a problem for Vector  Unlike most employers  Vector must provide transportation for its employees  since most do not drive   I changed some code and whatnot  like the input information  and I applied it to them picking up their employees so they could optimize their routes  said Lin   This will hopefully save them money  Lin is now working on his fourth task for Vector  which involves using the data amassed from the previous three tasks   accounting  payroll  and transportation   to help the company analyze the profitability of its contracts  The work done by Vector employees is subcontracted from local industries  For Lin  the project for Vector is a taste of what he d like to do after graduation from VMI  He s aspiring to earn a doctorate in mathematics and then work as a consultant in finance or industry   It s nice to see  Vector  benefit so much from my work  said Lin  who admitted he hadn t done much computer programming before tackling the projects for Vector  Maj  Geoff Cox  assistant professor of mathematics  has been supervising Lin s work  He noted that the AIM program is providing cadets with much needed opportunities

with Kent Iberg  left  CEO of Vector Industries  and David Tanner  Vector director of operations and engineering  on a project to automate the organization s accounting procedures    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  Cadet Project Automates Tasks for Waynesboro Non Profit LEXINGTON  Va  Aug 7  2013   A Waynesboro  Va  nonprofit organization that provides supported employment for adults with disabilities has had its record keeping and accounting processes sped up dramatically thanks to the efforts of Cadet Alex Lin  15  Lin  an applied mathematics major  is one of six cadets participating in VMI s Applied and Industrial Mathematics program this summer  The program began last year under the name REMACS  which stood for Research Experiences in Mathematics and Computer Science  Lin s project for Vector Industries has involved automating several time consuming tasks related to accounting  payroll  and transportation  Lin explained that one of Vector s main challenges had been putting together financial reports for its board of directors on a monthly basis  Using the computer language Visual Basic  Lin was able to automate the process of importing the financial records so information for the board could be made available with the click of a button   Previously  they had to copy and paste all of their stuff  explained Lin   The data analysis was really slow and inefficient  A second task that Lin tackled for Vector had to do with determining how much employees are paid  Because Vector s employees have disabilities  they are not required to be paid minimum wage under the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act  Rather  they are paid on a piecework basis  Lin explained that prior to his automation of the process  determining how much each individual should be paid was a cumbersome process that involved Vector s operations and engineering analyst taking a  snapshot  of time worked and pieces produced from six randomly selected weeks over the previous six months  Because Vector has over 100 employees  Lin continued  this meant the analyst was poring over 600 pieces of data at a time  That was difficult enough   but Lin was quick to note that tracking down and correcting human error made the process even more time consuming   A lot of times there are red flags from either employees entering the wrong amount of hours or entering the wrong amount of production parts they re produced  Lin said  Before Lin s computer program made its debut  conducting performance evaluations and resetting wages at Vector took two or three days of the operations and engineering analyst s time  Now  those tasks are accomplished in a matter of minutes  Lin s third task for Vector has built upon work done in the REMACS program last summer  In 2012  Cadet Alex Falcetti  14 developed a computer program for Valley Program for Aging Services to use in routing its Meals on Wheels delivery system for homebound seniors  so VPAS could deliver the meals in the most efficient manner possible  Lin took Falcetti s work and used it as a starting point to solve a problem for Vector  Unlike most employers  Vector must provide transportation for its employees  since most do not drive   I changed some code and whatnot  like the input information  and I applied it to them picking up their employees so they could optimize their routes  said Lin   This will hopefully save them money  Lin is now working on his fourth task for Vector  which involves using the data amassed from the previous three tasks   accounting  payroll  and transportation   to help the company analyze the profitability of its contracts  The work done by Vector employees is subcontracted from local industries  For Lin  the project for Vector is a taste of what he d like to do after graduation from VMI  He s aspiring to earn a doctorate in mathematics and then work as a consultant in finance or industry   It s nice to see  Vector  benefit so much from my work  said Lin  who admitted he hadn t done much computer programming before tackling the projects for Vector  Maj  Geoff Cox  assistant professor of mathematics  has been supervising Lin s work  He noted that the AIM program is providing cadets with much needed opportunities to take the math skills they ve learned in the classroom and apply them to solve real problems   I am very impressed with this program  said Cox   I never had it as an undergraduate  and I wish I could have had these types of opportunities because it s just nice being able to see what kind of problems that companies are facing  It doesn t necessarily overlap with what you learn in the classroom    It s a whole different ballgame when you re in a real world situation  Four other cadets are doing AIM projects this summer  They are Stephen Mascioli  15  for Young Life  Jack Zippel  16  for United Way of the Greater Augusta Region  and Will Lucas  14 and Stephen Geyer  14  for a confidential local company  AIM is partially funded by the Jackson Hope Foundation and also by the corporations or organizations hiring the cadets   Mary Price  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos
