San Rafael  Calif  in March to present their work at the National Conference for Undergraduate Research  NCUR  The three day conference offers a national forum for undergraduate research  Cadet Wesley Hopkins  07 presented a paper on Homeland Defense policy and examined the threat posed by viral hemorrhagic fevers  VHF  such as Ebola  Marburg and Lassa  as biological weapons and tools of terror  He researched the history of VHF agents  learned about the potential to turn them into weapons and examined the utility of biological weapons in combat  His final analysis focused on how a terrorist organization or rogue state might attempt to use VHF agents as biological weapons to attack the United States  and what Americans could expect as a response based on the country s current level of preparation   I had presented this work at the Big South Undergraduate Research Symposium and VMI s URS to minimal audiences at both  said Hopkins   Finally having people interested in my work come listen to me speak made the whole trip worthwhile  In addition to using my talents as a speaker and a researcher  I met a wide variety of individuals  perhaps even some with whom I will work in the future  and got the chance to hear what other people thought of my paper  Hopkins  who plans to commission in the Army  would like to be involved in homeland defense or national security  and he added that taking part in a number of research projects on the undergraduate level will be invaluable to a career as an analyst  public servant or teacher  The cadets  travel expenses were funded by VMI s Office of Undergraduate Research through a Jackson Hope Fund grant  The office selected Maj  Neal Messer  assistant professor of modern languages and cultures  to attend NCUR to explore undergraduate research opportunities that will benefit his discipline and the Institute   I have a much better idea of how to prepare my students not only for undergraduate research but also for national

work at the National Conference for Undergraduate Research  NCUR  The three day conference offers a national forum for undergraduate research  Cadet Wesley Hopkins  07 presented a paper on Homeland Defense policy and examined the threat posed by viral hemorrhagic fevers  VHF  such as Ebola  Marburg and Lassa  as biological weapons and tools of terror  He researched the history of VHF agents  learned about the potential to turn them into weapons and examined the utility of biological weapons in combat  His final analysis focused on how a terrorist organization or rogue state might attempt to use VHF agents as biological weapons to attack the United States  and what Americans could expect as a response based on the country s current level of preparation   I had presented this work at the Big South Undergraduate Research Symposium and VMI s URS to minimal audiences at both  said Hopkins   Finally having people interested in my work come listen to me speak made the whole trip worthwhile  In addition to using my talents as a speaker and a researcher  I met a wide variety of individuals  perhaps even some with whom I will work in the future  and got the chance to hear what other people thought of my paper  Hopkins  who plans to commission in the Army  would like to be involved in homeland defense or national security  and he added that taking part in a number of research projects on the undergraduate level will be invaluable to a career as an analyst  public servant or teacher  The cadets  travel expenses were funded by VMI s Office of Undergraduate Research through a Jackson Hope Fund grant  The office selected Maj  Neal Messer  assistant professor of modern languages and cultures  to attend NCUR to explore undergraduate research opportunities that will benefit his discipline and the Institute   I have a much better idea of how to prepare my students not only for undergraduate research but also for national presentations  said Messer   The positive aspect of the conference is that so many students are able to make a presentation at a national meeting and gain confidence in their presentation skills  As a new faculty member  I gained exposure to the types of research being performed at the undergraduate level in my field  and this will allow me to be a more effective research mentor  which I intend to be my main cadet development focus at VMI
