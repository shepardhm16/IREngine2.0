Force  Marine Cadets Protect   And Obstruct    Election  Marine option Naval ROTC cadets braved cold and rain to practice skills in a simulated force on force combat scenario during Spring FTX  April 4 to 7  To prepare  the cadets were presented with a fictitious background story in which the former Natural Bridge Juvenile Correctional Center  located in rural Rockbridge County  became a polling site for democratic elections being held in a war torn country   On Saturday morning  the company hiked out to McKethan Park and boarded   National Guard CH 47s  and were flown out to the detention center  said Cadet Josh Vaughan  14  FTX commanding officer  Divided into two groups   Bulldog Company  made up of cadets heading to Officer Candidate School  and Marine Company  everyone else  the cadets took up opposing roles   The Marine Company was acting as peacekeepers trying to facilitate this election  and Bulldog was acting as the opposing force that wanted to keep an authoritarian regime in power  explained Cadet Jack Gotwalt  14  FTX executive officer  Marine reservists in the Corps and alumni volunteered their assistance  acting as civilians in the vicinity of the detention center   It gave them a much more dynamic atmosphere to operate in  said Gotwalt   It was more than we ve done in the past   throwing a lot more variables at them   The cold and rain presented obstacles as well  making the night time operations harder to accomplish   in addition to just making it miserable  added Vaughan  Cadets spent their nights in the field sleeping out under the stars   no tents  just waterproof sleeping bags   I would say that the hardest part for most people was the lack of sleep  he continued   People were lucky to get around four hours a night  most people   including myself and Gotwalt   averaged around two  While Bulldog Company was significantly smaller in number  it carried the day more often than not   They maneuvered almost perfectly  observed Gotwalt   The level that they re at right now is very impressive  After concluding operations at the detention center on Monday  the cadets were bused to the Chessie Trail and hiked the seven mile route back to post   The midshipmen appreciated the training they got  said Vaughan   Even though it was extremely hard and we pushed them to their limits  this morning during and after the hike they were still pretty motivated because they got to go out and do some really cool things this weekend  This year s spring FTX evolved from last spring s  in which cadets spent a brief amount of time at stations that required use of a specific concept  including force on force   That was our favorite part of FTX  last year  recalled Vaughan   So we made the entire FTX a force on force where you had to apply all your skills in a combat setting at one time   Every year we step it up a little bit  take it a little bit farther  and improve upon the last year  continued Gotwalt  Both Vaughan and Gotwalt are commissioning in the Marine Corps in May and will report to The Basic School at Quantico  Va  this fall  Vaughan is on track to be a pilot while Gotwalt will be assigned after TBS  To see
