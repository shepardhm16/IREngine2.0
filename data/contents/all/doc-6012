Security Email is one of the most successful and widely used attack methods  Hackers and cyber spies use it to infect computers to cause harm and steal personal private and sensitive information  including academic research and other intellectual property  VMI Information Technology systems process over 100 000 inbound email messages a day  While 90  of those are identified as spam related and not delivered  a few still make it to their destination  To increase awareness of potentially suspicious email  IT staff implemented a process to tag messages that may be spam related or malicious in nature and require you to use extra care when opening  When a message appears to be suspect but cannot be confirmed to be so  its subject line will be prepended with  OPEN WITH CARE  Since  Microsoft hosts cadet email externally  cadets will not benefit from this additional screening  Be aware  Exercise care whether email is tagged or not  Some examples of phishing email are provided  This impersonator is spoofing a VMI email user  In this case  the  From  email account is not in the address book  Notice the attachment  Scammers can trick us into thinking that an email is coming from someone associated with VMI  but it is actually from an outside imposter  We are working to improve our malicious email detection techniques  You can do your part by asking yourself questions to help detect scam or phishing emails  Are you expecting the email  If you have not ordered anything recently then receiving an email from FedEx  other shipper  or vendor about a delivery is most likely a fake  Delete it  Is the format of the email address appropriate  Think about the format of the email address it comes from  For example VMI uses a person s last name and first and middle initial  LastFM vmi edu  So an address with the format of FirstLast VMI edu or LastFM vmi com would most likely be a fake  There are exceptions  so when in doubt contact the Help Desk by emailing Help vmi edu or call  540  464 7643  See example below in the yellow box  Are there spelling and grammatical errors  These errors are common in phishing emails  Would you provide this information to a stranger on your doorstep   Think about whether it is appropriate for this person to ask for this information and for you to provide it   Remember VMI IT staff will not ask for your password  This impersonator states that they are sending the email on behalf of administrator vmi edu using the DocuSign Electronic Signature Service  We do not use this service  Check the Outlook address book  administrator vmi edu is not in the address book  Notice that the email contains an attachment  If it seems odd   think about it  If you are not sure  check into it  Contact the Help Desk at help vmi edu  You are the first line of defense  Since the Institute s contact information is public  anyone with a computer can access the contact information and use it to telephone and send email  We need to be vigilant about providing sensitive information like social security numbers  financial account information with PIN  health and medical information and FERPA information only with proper authorization  Should you ever receive these types of messages or any similar messages  please follow the procedures below  DO NOT open the attachments  DO NOT reply to the message  DO NOT click on any links or attempt to  Download Pictures  within the email  DO NOT provide the sender with any username  password  or personal information  DELETE the message  NEVER provide your personal information to anyone  If you ever mistakenly  Click on links  you may be infected  contact the Help Desk  Enter username password information  please change your password immediately  Shipping confirmation or inquiries  as well as banking scams are a favorite of those trying to steal personal information or compromise systems  Before you click  think about whether the email makes sense  are you expecting something of this nature  Their goal is to trick you into clicking on that malicious link or document  or providing sensitive information  Do not open or click on the contents of the email if you are not sure  whether
