of my students have found the VMI Writing Center s services useful  especially foreign nationals struggling with English as a second language  as well as those at the top of the class working to get articles accepted into national and international journals Col  James C   Jim  Squire  Professor  Electrical   Computer Engineering  Using proper grammar is one of the most frequent problems I encounter with cadet writing  The Writing Center provides excellent guidance to cadets challenged with grammar rules  In my writing intensive course wherein I read drafts and final submissions  the improvement in writing quality from one or more visits to the Writing Center is demonstrable  Without doubt this one topic of assistance improves writing quality and helps make reading cadet papers a more satisfying experience  COL Robert W  Moreschi  Ph D  RFC  Dept  Head  Professor of Finanance  Dept  of Economics   Business  In ALL cases  even one visit improved student papers and grades  I hope they will continue to visit the Center throughout their cadetship    Faculty  History Friendly environment  approachable people  great set up  convenient hours    Student  The Writing Center  helped multiple users to develop a habit of composing and reflecting  And  as they realized their work was getting better  they were more encouraged to keep going to the Writing Center    Faculty  English   Fine Arts They help you  but you learn how to help yourself and do your own work    Student I always strongly encourage my students to use the Writing Center as a resource  There is no question the center is of significant value    Faculty  Psychology Philosophy The Writing Center s big strength  qualified instructors  humorous and comfortable  who guide you to think and do corrections in the paper by yourself    Student I believe that the Institute has a fine resource in the Writing Center and wish only that more of my cadets would avail themselves of its services  Indeed  I would like to be able to require my students who need help to consult with its staff    Faculty Member  History They help with the papers  but don t spoon feed    Student I really like it when students with high scores grades seek assistance from the Writing Center    Faculty  History The tutors work with you  not for you    Student I noticed that the basic writing skills were much improved in the memos from students that used the Writing Center  The memos were better organized  flawlessly punctuated  and seemed to exhibit more confidence  I appreciate your help   and will continue to recommend your service to my students in the future    Faculty  Naval Science VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT
