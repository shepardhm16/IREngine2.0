lines that describe the low point of the athletic competition recounted in the  VMI Spirit  the Institute s fight song  Those lines are the setup for the display of grit  determination  and teamwork   the spirit   needed for the Keydets to rise to the challenge  Photos she saw showed that spirit etched on the faces of cadets wending their way through tortuous obstacles that are part of the new North Post training area  For her  the spirit she sees in those photos and the spirit described in the  Spirit  expresses exactly the spirit VMI imbued in her father  Edmund A  Saunders III more than a century ago   My father truly felt there is a gift in the spirit of VMI  she said  Mrs  Brown took part in the May 9  2012  dedication of the North Post training area  a complex dedicated to the physical development of cadets that was made possible largely though her generosity and that of her late sister  Jane Quinn Saunders  The complex  Saunders Fields  is named in honor of her father  a graduate of the Class of 1906  Edmund Saunders was only 57 years old when he died in 1944  but he had accomplished much  he was a successful and respected businessman in Richmond  he operated several family farms  and he passed on to his daughters an abiding love for VMI  During frequent family trips to Lexington  his daughters frolicked on the Parade Ground  explored the post  and observed the alien and yet familiar life of cadets at the Institute   We loved coming to VMI  my sister and I  My father loved coming to graduation every year and to the football games  Mrs  Brown said from her home in Richmond   He said the only flaw with VMI was that he couldn t send his two daughters there  Of course  that was before women were allowed to attend VMI  He came to love VMI during his cadetship  The biographical account of this period in his life is impressive  He played baseball  he served as advertising editor of the Bomb  and he was assistant leader of the Final German Ball  By the time he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering  he so impressed his classmates that they elected him valedictorian  But it was the deeply personal attachment for VMI and his Brother Rats  developed during his cadetship  that so impressed his daughter   He was really bonded with his friends from his time as a cadet  Mrs  Brown said  The experience of the challenge of his cadetship and the lifelong friendships developed then provided him with  something that had given him a great deal of self confidence  The spirit gets into your being and stays with you always  And the spirit got into and stayed with Mrs  Brown and her sister  as well  So when the need for a complex of highly physical training facilities was identified  the sisters jumped at the opportunity to give back to the Institute   General Peay explained to me the value this would give cadets  Mrs  Brown said   This was the need  My father would have wanted to provide for the need  not necessarily for any particular project  I feel gratitude   more than a sense of pride   that my father left the resources that now I have the opportunity to help with this need  It is very special  Though Edmund Saunders would have approved of a gift supporting any project for VMI  the military and leadership field training grounds does resonate with Mrs  Brown   Part of learning is learning about your own self  she said  Saunders Fields provides facilities that allow cadets to  learn a lot about their own being  That is a gift the VMI regimen puts in their hands  My father felt that was an important part of a young person s development  That s why he loved VMI   for its values  for its integrity  for its ruggedness  Saunders Fields is a facility that supports the spirit of the VMI philosophy of developing young people by having them confront intense challenges   VMI gives young people a challenge  a reason to stick with it  Mrs  Brown said   The spirit is imparted to cadets  Never mind the books  they have a lot to live up to every day  Those photos of cadets showing their intense spirit as they draw on unknown reserves to overcome literal obstacles is a metaphor for spirit that stays with them throughout life allowing them to overcome figurative obstacles   a spirit Mrs  Brown saw in her father   The Keydets will fight  em and never say die That s the Spirit of VMI    VMI Foundation Keydet

honor of her father  a graduate of the Class of 1906  Edmund Saunders was only 57 years old when he died in 1944  but he had accomplished much  he was a successful and respected businessman in Richmond  he operated several family farms  and he passed on to his daughters an abiding love for VMI  During frequent family trips to Lexington  his daughters frolicked on the Parade Ground  explored the post  and observed the alien and yet familiar life of cadets at the Institute   We loved coming to VMI  my sister and I  My father loved coming to graduation every year and to the football games  Mrs  Brown said from her home in Richmond   He said the only flaw with VMI was that he couldn t send his two daughters there  Of course  that was before women were allowed to attend VMI  He came to love VMI during his cadetship  The biographical account of this period in his life is impressive  He played baseball  he served as advertising editor of the Bomb  and he was assistant leader of the Final German Ball  By the time he graduated with a degree in electrical engineering  he so impressed his classmates that they elected him valedictorian  But it was the deeply personal attachment for VMI and his Brother Rats  developed during his cadetship  that so impressed his daughter   He was really bonded with his friends from his time as a cadet  Mrs  Brown said  The experience of the challenge of his cadetship and the lifelong friendships developed then provided him with  something that had given him a great deal of self confidence  The spirit gets into your being and stays with
