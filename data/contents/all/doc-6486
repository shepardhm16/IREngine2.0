email to  english vmi edu Deidre Garriott  Ph D  Major Deidre Anne Evans Garriott received her B A  and M A  in English from Florida Gulf Coast University  She completed her Ph D  in English and specialized in rhetorical  writing  and linguistics from the University of Tennessee  Knoxville  under the direction of Michael Keene  Janet Atwill  Bill Hardwig  and James Stovall  She specializes in contemporary rhetorical theory  particularly intersection of the theories of space and place  material rhetoric  and public memory  She comes to VMI after serving as the Acting Director of the Writing Center at the University of Tennessee  Knoxville  during her post doctoral appointment  Major Garriott researches the ways that communities remember the past  as well the kinds of performances and civic activities that are being endorsed and elicited through the public s interactions with these memories  She is particularly interested in regionalized public memory  For her dissertation  she studied a park in Charleston  South Carolina  and the way that political and social systems impacted the park spatially and materially  She was interested in how the park was a strategy in rhetorical identification and examined the rhetorical strategies at work in the park s construction and its material manifestation in Charleston  In 2014  Major Garriott co edited and contributed to a collection of critical essays with Dr  Julie Tyler and Dr  Whitney Jones  both from the University of Tennessee  Knoxville  The collection Space and Place in The Hunger Games  New Readings of the Novels provides an interdisciplinary examination of Suzanne Collins s best selling Hunger Games trilogy  In her chapter  Major Garriott analyzes the tweets  blog posts  and New York Times articles that respond to the casting choices for the first film  She argues that these digital writings construct a panoptic rhetoric  a rhetoric that Collins fears and explores in the trilogy  and posits that we are constructing Panem and its systems digitally  Major Garriott is currently revising her dissertation manuscript to send for publication and has begun working on a book length monograph on the rhetoric of World War II memorials in the South  Major Garriott s publications and presentations include  Space and Place in The Hunger Games  New Readings of the Novels  Eds  Deidre Anne Evans Garriott  Whitney Elaine
