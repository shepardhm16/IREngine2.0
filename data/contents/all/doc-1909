School Information  for Majors in Modern Languages and Cultures The decision to attend graduate school for a Masters or Ph D  is not an easy one  Those seeking such degrees need to be able to show language and cultural fluency to even be considered for most graduate programs  Many require candidates to submit writing and speaking samples in the language he she intends to study  All candidates must also take the Graduate Record Examination  GRE  and submit scores to the institutes to which they apply  During graduate school  most students teach undergraduate language classes or serve as Teaching Assistants for professors  Others serve as research assistants to faculty members  The number of classes one teaches per semester and the stipend per class varies greatly from institution to institution  Be sure to inquire about teaching expectations  pay  and or research assistantship expectations  Most universities pay for some or all of the cost of tuition as well as medical insurance in exchange for a teaching or research assistantship  Graduate work in modern languages is usually divided into two branches  literature and linguistics  Graduates with degrees in literatures study and research the great works written in the language  while writing research papers on prose  poetry  or theater that investigate areas of interest particular to that student  Knowledge and application of literary theory is a must  People focusing on the linguistics track study the social factors inherent in learning a language and how languages are best taught  The study of linguistics

society s understanding of the Muslim world is Islamic Studies  This is a very diverse field which studies Muslim culture  Muslim history  the historical study of Islam  and Islamic economics  There is an increasing demand for specialists in Islamic Studies  as many universities seek to breach the sometimes wide chasm that separates the Islamic world from American universities  At the same time  numerous Masters and Ph D  programs offer degrees in Arabic language and literature  In the past  a person with a Masters or Ph D  in a modern language most always sought a teaching position at a college or university teaching the language of his or her degree  This is still the case in many instances  and teaching is a rewarding and highly respected vocation  Recently  however  private companies are seeking people with language AND cultural fluency  Regrettably  in the United States the lack of exposure to foreign languages in the elementary and middle schools has increasingly produced monolingual high school graduates with limited cultural knowledge of other countries or ways of life  Graduates with advanced degrees in modern language are tasked with broadening the
