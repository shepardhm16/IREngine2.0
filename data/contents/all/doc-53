Academic Catalogue  ARCHIVED CATALOG  Physics and Astronomy Print Friendly Page Physics is the study of the basic laws that describe all natural phenomena  and it is often instrumental to the development of new technologies  At VMI dedicated faculty mentors help cadets develop strong analytical reasoning  laboratory  computational  and technical communication skills  They also provide our majors with the opportunity to combine skills developed in their coursework with the creativity needed to solve real world problems in independent research projects in pure and applied physics  Mathematics is an integral part of the study of physics  and it is essential for students to come with strong mathematics skills to successfully pursue the physics major  While the physics curriculum is rich in applied mathematics  it is also a wellbalanced program with many opportunities to develop hands on laboratory and computer programming skills and to probe the relationship between experiment and mathematical theory that is the hallmark of physics  The physics curriculum is a flexible curriculum that provides an excellent opportunity for the development of intellectual breadth while also building strong scientific and technical skills  Our degree programs offer a generous complement of electives  allowing cadets to obtain one or more minors or even to double major in select cases  This flexibility allows each cadet to point the degree along the career path that they wish to pursue  Historically  physics has been a very marketable degree that graduates use to follow a wide range of career paths in the military  industry  and in education  Our B S  physics degree program offers solid training for many technical career paths or for graduate study in physics and other closely allied technical fields  In addition to the core curriculum requirements  it includes 15 credit hours of free electives  6 credit hours of humanities and social science electives  and 12 hours of technical electives  Our B S  in physics with a concentration in nuclear energy is specifically designed to prepare students for work in the nuclear power industry  the Navy s NUPOC program  or for graduate study in Nuclear Engineering  It includes 12 credit hours of free electives  6 credit hours of humanities and social science electives  6 credit hours of technical electives  and 6 credit hours of physics electives  at the 300 or 400 level  Our B A  physics degree program is well suited to the student who wants to major in physics but who also has strong interests in the humanities or social sciences  The B A  degree program is also designed to allow those cadets interested in teaching physics at the high school level to work toward teacher certification while they complete their physics degree  With 21 credit hours of free electives  the B A  option allows a cadet to pursue a second area of study in depth  and it is expected that some of the free elective hours will be used to obtain a minor or to pursue a double major  There are also 9 hours of technical electives and 9 hours of physics electives  at the 200  300  or 400 level  Finally  cadets pursuing the B A  are required to meet a four semester foreign language requirement or demonstrate equivalent proficiency  The department houses a generous complement of wellequipped classrooms  teaching laboratories and faculty research laboratories  The teaching laboratories include two general physics laboratories  an electronics and interfacing laboratory  an optics laboratory  and a modern physics laboratory  The department has a small accelerator and nuclear physics laboratory in the basement of Mallory Hall  and the VMI Observatory  a short drive from Post  has a 20 inch reflecting telescope and an array of smaller telescopes that are used in our astronomy courses and for faculty and cadet research projects  Faculty conduct research with cadets in laboratories devoted to organic thin film device fabrication and characterization  laser physics and fiber optics  solid state and gas phase laser spectroscopy  and astronomy  Every cadet who completes the degree program will work one on one or in a small group with a faculty mentor on a research project  Cadets majoring in physics and the fulltime physics faculty form a close knit academic community in which cadets can pursue a deeper understanding of the physical world while also preparing for a broad array of career paths  Programs Physics Minor Physics with Nuclear Concentration  B S  Physics  B A  Physics  B S    Back to Top
