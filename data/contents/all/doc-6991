Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley March 2008  The scene is the squad room and office in a New York police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost Dramatists Play  VMI Theatre Presents  The Three Musketeers Adapted by Peter Raby from Dumas

police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost

Hall  VMI Theatre Presents  The Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley March 2008  The scene is the squad room and office in a New York police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost Dramatists Play  VMI Theatre Presents  The Three Musketeers Adapted by

Hall  VMI Theatre Presents  The Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley March 2008  The scene is the squad room and office in a New York police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost Dramatists Play  VMI Theatre Presents  The Three Musketeers Adapted by

Hall  VMI Theatre Presents  The Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley March 2008  The scene is the squad room and office in a New York police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost Dramatists Play  VMI Theatre Presents  The Three Musketeers Adapted by

Hall  VMI Theatre Presents  The Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley March 2008  The scene is the squad room and office in a New York police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost Dramatists Play  VMI Theatre Presents  The Three Musketeers Adapted by

VMI Theatre Presents  The Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley The Detective Story By Sidney Kingsley March 2008 The scene is the squad room and office in a New York police station  The playwright presents a fascinatingly realistic picture of routine cases brought into a metropolitan police station in the course of a day  Out of the welter of human misery  vice and stupidity there emerges the tragic and moving case of a decent young fellow who has stolen money from his employer  Though a woman who is in love with him comes to his help and the employer is offered everything that has been taken from him  the case has fallen into the hands of McLeod  a hardworking detective whose experience in police work has developed in him a mania for punishing all law breakers  whom he regards as incorrigibles  Nothing will satisfy him but brutal punishment  He is at work at the same time on a case involving an abortionist whose attorney  failing to move him by other means  forces McLeod s wife to confess to her husband that she had herself some years before made use of the services of the abortionist in question  Since McLeod worships his wife and finds in her the only happiness of his existence  his world collapses about him  The climax comes when McLeod gets involved with the aid of a revolver taken from one of the detectives McLeod is shot and killed  This climax is a fitting end to McLeod s career  To the last  he had been bent upon doing what he considered his duty in seeing that criminals obeyed the letter of the law at no matter what cost Dramatists Play punishing  VMI
