to present an Environmental Engineering and Construction summer program in Potosi  Bolivia  Dates  May 21   June 18  2016 Cost  6 credits  3500  excluding airfare  Subject to BOV approval   Fees include tuition  in country accommodations  two meals day  and in country transportation  International airfare and incidentals are not included  Program Director  A 1997 and 1993 graduate of VMI  Lieutenant Colonel Moore and Major Ackerman obtained their PhDs in Civil Engineering from Virginia Tech  They believe that research and new technologies greatly enhance the overall learning experience  and that environmental engineers have a social responsibility  Therefore  they have established new research and initiatives to advance instruction at VMI through VMI Keydets Without Borders  VMI KWB  a research and study abroad program that provides design and construction of sustainable water and sanitation facilities in developing communities  This program has been instrumental in teaching the concepts of austere  rudimentary development and operation of water and wastewater treatment systems coupled with sustainable energy concepts  solar  biomass  To date  the group has designed solar and gravity powered pumping facilities for sustainable  portable farm  aquaculture projects in Uganda and Bolivia  solar thermal energy showers using recycled construction materials in Bolivia  anaerobic waste treatment and energy generation facilities and solar devices for the capture and conveyance of potable water sources within resource poor communities of Haiti  Bolivia and Uganda  This program has also focused on the pyrolitic development of manure based biochars for the purposes of drinking water filtration  Specifically  the program is focusing on the development of llama and alpaca manure biochars for the filtration of mine waste contaminated water sources in the Andes region of Bolivia  These projects have proven to provide a very innovative and sustainable means of clean water  thus improving overall health conditions within communities and greatly enhancing experiential learning in the field  Preliminary research suggests that the program has reduced community infant mortality rates by more than 40  saving the lives of more than 4 000 children worldwide    Eligibility Any current student in good standing with an accredited university is eligible to apply  VMI students need only submit an application  Applicants from other universities should include a faculty letter of recommendation  an official transcript  and a short essay outlining the applicant s personal and academic goals for the program  along with the application  Applications must be received no later than 18 December 2015   Program CE 372X  Environmental Engineering and Construction in Developing Countries  is a three credit hour course which uses hands on application of rudimentary field design and construction techniques for the implementation of basic environmental necessities in developing communities and the enhancement of overall quality of human life  Students conduct construction activities in various developing communities worldwide  The course explores the role of the environmental engineer  and specifically the average human being in worldwide public health and seeks to promote an awareness of communities lacking access to basic human rights such as clean drinking water and adequate sanitation  Students will maintain a daily journal or blog while in country and will publish the blog or journal on ePortfolio upon return to the U S  Students are also required to write a preliminary design report for implementation of in country design  and a final reflective essay to be posted on ePortfolio for dissemination to the general VMI public  Room and Board Students will be living within the community in which the project is being implemented  Students will camp in the local school building located in the community  Cultural Experience Students in this class will work together to design and implement sustainable engineering  medical  environmental  and economical projects to help impoverished communities become healthier and self sufficient  100  of this course is active  hands on engaged learning from both a practical problem solving perspective and interpersonal and cultural relations  The goal of this class is to provide students with the opportunity to apply their diverse academic backgrounds to real life situations for the benefit of those lacking basic human needs  such as clean drinking water and basic medical care  while gaining real life experience communicating and working effectively in another culture  and gaining appreciation and respect for cultures  By gaining an appreciation and respect for their own unique skillset and leadership skills along with the great need for this knowledge  cadets will become well rounded citizen soldiers armed with the life experience and expertise to lead and facilitate positive change
