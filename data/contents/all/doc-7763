 Bringing Entrepreneurship to Science The Engineering Entrepreneurship Initiative  EEI  is a new program developed to give Entrepreneurship students the opportunity to write business plans for patented intellectual property  These inventions were developed right here at the Institute within the departments of Math   Computer Science and Electrical   Computer Engineering  VMI s Office of Grants  Contracts and Intellectual Property  headed by Cdr  Mike Sebastino  helped to narrow the choices by identifying several pieces of intellectual property for prospective commercialization  This program emphasizes the interdisciplinary nature of the academic endeavor in joining various departments throughout Post  while potentially providing great benefit to the Institute overall in taking advantage of the new IP policy at VMI  which provides institutional support to inventors in the VMI community  Each of three groups of ECBU cadets created a business plan based on their chosen inventions and competed in the first Annual EEI Business Plans competition held here at VMI on May 1st  2007  Four judges active in the early stage business funding arena came to VMI to judge the
