24450 Institute Report  August 2008  By Bob Holland Speaking Spanish While Caring for Costa Rican Preschoolers an Eye Opening Experience    On Cadet Greg Hersh s very first day of volunteering at an orphanage in Costa Rica last spring  a 3 year old named Aaron Salazar with big brown eyes  black hair  and a continuous smile caught his attention  After Hersh  09 had met his class and helped the preschoolers put on their shoes following an afternoon nap  Aaron asked if the visitor from VMI would sing  Gusanito  Gusanito  with him  Hersh explained in his broken Spanish that he had no idea what tune that was  so Aaron played the nursery song on the classroom radio six times  each time drilling Hersh on the dance steps that accompany the lyrics   Now  five months later  not only do I still remember every word and body movement  mused Hersh   but I can t seem to get the terribly repetitive chorus out of my head  Nor can he forget the experiences he had as a volunteer with the Hospicio de Huerfanos in San Jose  Costa Rica  Nor does he want to  Those experiences  said Hersh   opened my eyes to so much more  than any classroom setting alone could have   I had never played with kids before  I had never worked with parentless children before  and I had never really been asked to communicate in Spanish for hours on end  The children helped  because I didn t have time to worry about how I sounded  just as long as we could communicate back and forth  They didn t judge my gringo accent  which allowed me to loosen up and not worry so much  Hersh  a modern languages major with secondary majors in English and history  was in Costa Rica studying Spanish at a university  A Jackson Hope grant to VMI s Department of Modern Languages and Cultures enabled him to add the element of learning through volunteer work two days a week  Jackson Hope  said department head Kathleen Bulger Barnett   allows us to place cadets in short term volunteer positions in which they use their language skills  Service organizations such as Americorps  Cross Cultural Solutions  Bridges to Community  and Humane Borders provide opportunities for cadets to work for good causes while speaking a foreign tongue  In some cases  cadets and professors arrange the volunteer work themselves    Hersh assisted a full time teacher of eight children  arriving in the afternoon just after naptime   A typical day  he said   consisted of regular things kids aged 2 to 4 like to do  play  run around in the courtyard  and snack     Volunteering was  as overused and clich d as it sounds  rewarding  I d never been a big fan of kids that young  having been a youth referee and dealing with their lack of focus and abundance of energy  However  interacting with my group week after week  learning their personalities  was interesting   I certainly understand the patience that goes into managing a group of preschoolers  My time spent there was demanding  frustrating  and terribly gratifying    Hersh also says his experience helped broaden his cultural understanding  At first  not knowing how he would be received  he shied away from meeting local residents  However  once the volunteer work began and residents realized he was there to help  contacts increased greatly   I was opened up to several new ideas and concepts that I had never been exposed to  he concluded  VMI Foundation Keydet Club
