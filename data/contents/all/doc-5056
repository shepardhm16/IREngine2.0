Dinner GENERAL J  H  BINFORD PEAY  III SUPERINTENDENT 13 September 2013 Ladies and gentlemen  let me add my welcome as well to the VMI Sports Hall of Fame dinner  and my thanks to the Selection Committee for their work  Tonight s event marks the 29th time we have gathered to honor former VMI athletes of extraordinary athletic talent and achievement  Their hard work  commitment  and skill brought well deserved attention to them as players and greatly enhanced the reputation of VMI s athletic programs and mission  A Newsweek reporter once reminded his audience that there are  regretfully  no academic pages in our newspapers  but there are sports pages  and it is through those daily and weekly reports that many in the general public learn about or keep in touch with institutions of higher education  Our athletes  in other words  regularly serve as our ambassadors to the wider world  And those who excel brighten and often clarify the image of our institutions  Athletics at VMI play a larger role in the life of the Institute than found at most other colleges and universities  To a great degree  the success of our athletes and our teams has a direct bearing on the morale of the Corps because ours is an extraordinarily  close knit  community  Athletes do not live apart from the rest of the Corps  nor are they exempt from much of the training of other cadets  Our teams are not adjuncts to our mission  they are integral parts of that mission  and have been for many years  I have often said that at VMI the ideal is   Every athlete is a cadet  and every cadet is an athlete  That doesn t mean  of course  that every cadet is a Division I or intercollegiate athlete  Instead  every cadet is engaged in some form of athletic competition  not only for health and strength  but to build on the qualities of hard work  self discipline  determination  confidence  and teamwork  Rat Challenge  and the  massive explosion  and growth of our Club Sports add to that reputation and our mission  Our athletic program has evolved over the years  from only a fencing team in the earliest days of the Institute  to a full roster of teams today  We are intensely proud of our current intercollegiate program of men s and women s sports  and I believe  firmly  that we are headed for a decade of success with them  Our affiliation with other colleges has also evolved and continues to evolve  For many years VMI was the oldest member of the Southern Conference  It was founded in 1921 and VMI was admitted in the fall of 1924  In 2003  we left the Southern to join the Big South Conference  The Institute is consistently recognized as one of the smallest colleges playing Division I athletics  We have enjoyed our affiliation with the Big South and won the Big South Institutional Sportsmanship Award seven  7  of the past eight  8  years  Recently  we were invited to rejoin the Southern Conference  a move that will take place 31 May 2014  When we speak of conferences and teams  we are also speaking of individual athletes  coaches  and faculty   men and women who give it their all every day of their seasons  and often beyond  They deserve our praise and recognition  In that regard  I should mention COL John Barrett this evening  long time VMI representative to and a leader in the governing of the Southern Conference  In the past several years  our cars were often parked  on game days  next to each other near Cameron Hall  We would discuss the victories and defeats of our basketball and wrestling Teams before departing often during the coldest of evenings  COL Barrett will be missed a giant in his time in the classroom and in athletics at the Institute  And  COL Don Jamison will be recognized this evening  As a young Major  he taught me Fluids in his first class upon completing military duty and returning to the Institute as a member of the faculty in 1959  He was the best of instructors and we all had enormous respect for him then and even more so today 54 years later  Caring  capable  competent  involved and loyal to the traditions  discipline  and requirements of the Institute he is still active and represents the very best of our faculty  The men we honor  and those who have been honored over the years by inclusion in this Hall of Fame  have distinguished themselves   and yet they remained part of the larger team  part of the Corps  part of the VMI community  That is the hallmark of the VMI athletic program  that is our strength  that is  The Spirit of VMI  Congratulations to our newest inductees this evening  You

Dinner GENERAL J  H  BINFORD PEAY  III SUPERINTENDENT 13 September 2013 Ladies and gentlemen  let me add my welcome as well to the VMI Sports Hall of Fame dinner  and my thanks to the Selection Committee for their work  Tonight s event marks the 29th time we have gathered to honor former VMI athletes of extraordinary athletic talent and achievement  Their hard work  commitment  and skill brought well deserved attention to them as players and greatly enhanced the reputation of VMI s athletic programs and mission  A Newsweek reporter once reminded his audience that there are  regretfully  no academic pages in our newspapers  but there are sports pages  and it is through those daily and weekly reports that many in the general public learn about or keep in touch with institutions of higher education  Our athletes  in other words  regularly serve as our ambassadors to the wider world  And those who excel brighten and often clarify the image of our institutions  Athletics at VMI play a larger role in the life of the Institute than found at most other colleges and universities  To a great degree  the success of our athletes and our teams has a direct bearing on the morale of the Corps because ours is an extraordinarily  close knit  community  Athletes do not live apart from the rest of the Corps  nor are they exempt from much of the training of other cadets  Our teams are not adjuncts to our mission  they are integral parts of that mission  and have been for many years  I have often said that at VMI the ideal is   Every athlete is a cadet  and every cadet is an athlete  That doesn t mean  of course  that every cadet is a Division I or intercollegiate athlete  Instead  every cadet is engaged in some form of athletic competition  not only for health and strength  but to build on the qualities of hard work  self discipline  determination  confidence  and teamwork  Rat Challenge  and the  massive explosion  and growth of our Club Sports add to that reputation and our mission  Our athletic program has evolved over the years  from only a fencing team in the earliest days of the Institute  to a full roster of teams today  We are intensely proud of our current intercollegiate program of men s and women s sports  and I believe  firmly  that we are headed for a decade of success with them  Our affiliation with other colleges has also evolved and continues to evolve  For many years VMI was the oldest member of the Southern Conference  It was founded in 1921 and VMI was admitted in the fall of 1924  In 2003  we left the Southern to join the Big South Conference  The Institute is consistently recognized as one of the smallest colleges playing Division I athletics  We have enjoyed our affiliation with the Big South and won the Big South Institutional Sportsmanship Award seven  7  of the past eight  8  years  Recently  we were invited to rejoin the Southern Conference  a move that will take place 31 May 2014  When we speak of conferences and teams  we are also speaking of individual athletes  coaches  and faculty   men and women who give it their all every day of their seasons  and often beyond  They deserve our praise and recognition  In that regard  I should mention COL John Barrett this evening  long time VMI representative to and a leader in the governing of the Southern Conference  In the past several years  our cars were often parked  on game days  next to each other near Cameron Hall  We would discuss the victories and defeats of our basketball and wrestling Teams before departing often during the coldest of evenings  COL Barrett will be missed a giant in his time in the classroom and in athletics at the Institute  And  COL Don Jamison will be recognized this evening  As a young Major  he taught me Fluids in his first class upon completing military duty and returning to the Institute as a member of the faculty in 1959  He was the best of instructors and we all had enormous respect for him then and even more so today 54 years later  Caring  capable  competent  involved and loyal to the traditions  discipline  and requirements of the Institute he is still active and represents the very best of our faculty  The men we honor  and those who have been honored over the years by inclusion in this Hall of Fame  have distinguished themselves   and yet they remained part of the larger team  part of the Corps  part of the VMI community  That is the hallmark of the VMI athletic program  that is our strength  that is  The Spirit of VMI  Congratulations to our newest inductees this evening  You make us proud Administration Home Superintendent Home General Peay s Bio Vision 2039 VMI Mission Speeches Leadership Staff Lori Parrent Secretary to Gen  Peay P   540  464 7311 F   540  464 7660 E
