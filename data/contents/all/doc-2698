Political analyst and author Kirsten Powers delivered a stinging critique of the current climate of intolerance on college and university campuses around the country when she addressed the opening

memorable examples of this  group think  in action  At Washington State College  a professor decreed that referring to women as  females  and men as  males  should be counted as  oppressive and hateful language  and warned that students who did so might fail the class  In November 2013  more than two dozen graduate students at the University of California at Los Angeles accused a professor of creating an unsafe and hostile environment for students of color  The professor s supposed offense had been changing the capitalization of  Indigenous  to  indigenous  in a student paper   Now what we have is teaching treated as an act of aggression  Powers noted  At the University of New Hampshire  Powers said  a bias free language guide posted on the university s website proscribes the use of

that the professor  who continues to teach at the publicly funded university  called the demonstrators  terrorists  and told police that her rights had been violated by the presence of a pro life

of inclusion  but Powers sees the situation differently  She remarked   This is straight out of a George Orwell novel  It s more than just a language preference or an effort to avoid hurt feelings  This is thought control and an effort to enforce conformity to an ideological agenda    At the University of New Hampshire  they are banning speech to create dialogue  which makes absolutely no sense  These examples might seem extreme  but Powers noted that they are hardly rare  According to a report by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Freedoms  more than 55 percent of colleges and universities now maintain red light speech codes   These are particularly dangerous because they are so subjective  with what is dangerous defined by mostly liberal professors and administrators  Powers remarked   Trying to determine what is going to cause someone offense is a fool s errand  She mentioned that this summer one professor who has taught for a decade at a mid size public university wrote an essay   My liberal students terrify me  for a higher education blog  The professor  Powers said  was so afraid to voice his concerns about the intolerant atmosphere on campus that he wrote the piece under a pseudonym   Even satire is under attack  Powers continued  explaining that at the University of Alaska  a clearly satirical piece gently poking fun at the women s studies department that ran in the April Fool s Day issue of the school newspaper resulted in a Title IX investigation against the student who wrote it  Across the country  at the University of Michigan  a student who wrote a satirical piece about the challenges of being left handed found himself not only removed from the staff of the school newspaper  but had his home attacked  with eggs and hot dogs thrown at his door  Intolerant actions  too  are just as pervasive as a lack of tolerance for words  Powers noted  as she offered a ready slate of examples  At Northern Kentucky University  a professor told students to destroy a pro life display set up on campus  and at Dartmouth College  a professor ran over such a display with an automobile  one ironically bearing a  Co Exist  bumper sticker  Nor is the atmosphere of intolerance limited to the East Coast  Powers noted  She mentioned that at the University of California at Santa Barbara  a feminist studies professor physically attacked a 16 year old demonstrator who was handing out pro life literature  and then stole the demonstrator s sign and destroyed it  Powers said that the professor  who continues to teach at the publicly funded university  called the demonstrators  terrorists  and told police that her rights had been violated by the presence of a pro life demonstration on campus  Powers also touched upon the proliferation of  safe spaces  on campus  to be used by students who feel threatened by the words or actions of an individual or group with whom they disagree  Oftentimes  she noted  the  safe spaces  are accompanied by  trigger warnings  aimed at letting students know that someone or something controversial is nearby  These  trigger warnings  Powers explained  can include not only words and images  but also sounds and even smells   It should be obvious that the students who are demanding these trigger warnings and safe spaces are in fact not passive victims but victimizing aggressors  Powers said   If anything needs a safe space on campus  it s free speech  Wrapping up her remarks  Powers urged the cadets to step up and challenge this growing climate of intolerance  as it stifles intellectual growth for all   If you don t have the clash of ideas in a college environment  you don t have knowledge  she said   You are the future leaders of our country   you have the responsibility to stand up for free speech  Powers counseled   Do you want to live in the land of the free and the brave  or the land of the silenced and the afraid    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation

McLaughlin  Kirsten Powers Counsels Cadets to Stand Up for Free Speech LEXINGTON  Va  Sept  9  2015   Political analyst and author Kirsten Powers delivered a stinging critique of the current climate of intolerance on college and university campuses around the country when she addressed the opening convocation at Virginia Military Institute earlier today  Later  she sat down with a small group of cadets for a discussion session  Speaking to an audience of cadets  faculty  staff  and community members gathered in Cameron Hall  Powers  a longtime Fox News analyst and former Clinton administration staffer  drew many incredible but true anecdotes of such intolerance from her recently published book  The Silencing  How the Left is Killing Free Speech  In the book  Powers argues that the  illiberal left    a term she coined to describe individuals who claim to support freedom and tolerance yet fail to demonstrate those qualities toward those who disagree with them   have taken over college campuses to the point that some professors have become afraid to teach  Likewise  Powers notes  the past decade has seen many instances in which students mobilize in anger whenever a conservative speaker is invited to campus  and often succeed in having the speaker disinvited   Free speech is under attack on our college campuses  Powers warned her audience at VMI   Debate and dissent are dying  and they re being replaced by an authoritarian group think  Powers  remarks were peppered with memorable examples of this  group think  in action  At Washington State College  a professor decreed that referring to women as  females  and men as  males  should be counted as  oppressive and hateful language  and warned that students who did so might fail the class  In November 2013  more than two dozen graduate students at the University of California at Los Angeles accused a professor of creating an unsafe and hostile environment for students of color  The professor s supposed offense had been changing the capitalization of  Indigenous  to  indigenous  in a student paper   Now what we have is teaching treated as an act of aggression  Powers noted  At the University

enforce conformity to an ideological agenda    At the University of New Hampshire  they are banning speech to create dialogue  which makes absolutely no sense  These examples might seem extreme  but Powers noted that they are hardly rare  According to a report by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Freedoms  more than 55 percent of colleges and universities now maintain red light speech codes   These are particularly dangerous because they are so subjective  with what is dangerous defined by mostly liberal professors and administrators  Powers remarked   Trying to determine what is going to cause someone offense is a fool s errand  She mentioned that this summer one professor who has taught for a decade at a mid size public university wrote an essay   My liberal students terrify me  for a higher education blog  The professor  Powers said  was so afraid to voice his concerns about the intolerant atmosphere on campus that he wrote the piece under a pseudonym   Even satire is under attack  Powers continued  explaining that at the University of Alaska  a clearly satirical piece gently poking fun at the women s studies department that ran in the April Fool s Day issue of the school newspaper resulted in a Title IX investigation against the student who wrote it  Across the country  at the University of Michigan  a student who wrote a satirical piece about the challenges of being left handed found himself not only removed from the staff of the school newspaper  but had his home attacked  with eggs and hot dogs thrown at his door  Intolerant actions  too  are just as pervasive as a lack of tolerance for words  Powers noted  as she offered a ready slate of examples  At Northern Kentucky University  a professor told students to destroy a pro life display set up on campus  and at Dartmouth College  a professor ran over such a display with an automobile  one ironically bearing a  Co Exist  bumper sticker  Nor is the atmosphere of intolerance limited to the East Coast  Powers noted  She mentioned that at the University of California at Santa Barbara  a feminist studies professor physically attacked a 16 year old demonstrator who was handing out pro life literature  and then stole the demonstrator s sign and destroyed it  Powers said that the professor  who continues to teach at the publicly funded university  called the demonstrators  terrorists  and told police that her rights had been violated by the presence of a pro life demonstration on campus  Powers also touched upon the proliferation of  safe spaces  on campus  to be used by students who feel threatened by the words or actions of an individual or group with whom they disagree  Oftentimes  she noted  the  safe spaces  are accompanied by  trigger warnings  aimed at letting students know that someone or something controversial is nearby  These  trigger warnings  Powers explained  can include not only words and images  but also sounds and even smells   It should be obvious that the students who are demanding these trigger warnings and safe spaces are in fact not passive victims but victimizing aggressors  Powers said   If anything needs a safe space on campus  it s free speech  Wrapping up her remarks  Powers urged the cadets to step up and challenge this growing climate of intolerance  as it stifles intellectual growth for all   If you don t have the clash of ideas in a college environment  you don t have knowledge  she said   You are the future leaders of our country   you have the responsibility to stand up for free speech  Powers counseled   Do you want to live in the land of the free and the brave  or the land of the silenced and the afraid    Mary Price   The Silencing  How the Left is Killing Free Speech
