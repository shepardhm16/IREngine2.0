organisms in biological communities  Goals of the course are to present important principles of ecology  and to illustrate how biotic and abiotic factors converge to influence distribution and abundance  Course objectives are achieved using lectures  field   laboratory exercises  written laboratory reports  assigned readings  and group discussions  Lectures are designed to provide an understanding of important concepts in ecology  which is reinforced by hands on field   laboratory experiences  Assigned readings and group discussions promote  learning through the synthesis of important concepts and issues  Field   Laboratory Exercises  Because this is a course about ecosystems  a number of laboratory exercises will be held in the field  That means cadets can expect to get cold  dirty  and or wet at times   it s part of the beauty of ecology  Being in the field is the only way to get hands on experience with the ecosystems learned about in class  and it will provide cadets with an appreciation for practical considerations related to field studies  The uniform for field activities will be ACU  Tentative dates for field trips are listed in the laboratory schedule  but they are subject to change as I deem necessary  Laboratory exercises will be conducted in small groups and data collected during these exercises will be analyzed in lab  In addition to in class work  everyone is required to write and submit laboratory reports individually  The purpose of these reports is to learn  scientific writing skills and improve your ability to interpret scientific data  The best way to improve your writing is to write  read  and edit your own statements and thoughts  There will be 14 laboratory exercises scheduled for this semester  Missing a single laboratory meeting  regardless of the reason  will make it extremely difficult to achieve course goals and is likely to impact your grade  In most cases there will be no way for you to make up missed exercises  Therefore  I suggest that you do your best to miss as few labs as possible  The exercises I have planned will be fun  but some require special preparation and they are time sensitive  In particular  to avoid killing the small mammals we will study  we ll need to set and check traps outside of the normal laboratory time  I may decide to use lecture time to check traps and process animals in the field  but also will need volunteers to help set up and collect traps outside of normal meeting times  In addition to trapping small mammals  rodents and insectivores  I will offer a voluntary bat field trip if time and weather permit  The goal of this will be to give you a chance to see some interesting organisms that most people know very little about  as well as show you some techniques used to study them  Details for these events will be discussed in class  Field Notes  Field notebooks are an integral part of field biology  All good field biologists take detailed notes  and the best biologists do so religiously  Field notes provide a written record of your observations and activities that can be useful to you  e g  when writing lab reports  other researchers  future scientists and historians  For this reason  the VMI Biology Department will supply each of you with a waterproof notebook that you are expected to use to record notes during all field outings  Notebooks will be submitted for grade near the end of the semester  Grades will be based on whether notes are complete  are adequately detailed  and are in the proper format  to be discussed in class  Notes must be written while in the field  or at the least  at the end of the day  and be based on your personal observations and experiences in the field  Consulting one another while in the field or at the end of the outing to make sure notes are accurate is common practice among field biologists and is acceptable in this class  However  consulting the field notes of your peers afterwards because you didn t complete them when you should have is NOT acceptable  Field notebooks will be returned to you before the end of the semester and you are encouraged to continue keeping field notes after this class has ended  i e  in other classes or on personal trips  Laboratory Reports  Cadets are required to submit three laboratory reports over the course of the semester  Reports will be based on data collected in lab  and they are to be written in standard scientific format  with a title page  abstract  introduction  methods  results  discussion  acknowledgments  and literature cited sections  and if appropriate  figures and tables  Additionally  reports must be written as concisely and accurately as humanly possible  Grading will be assessed using a rubric based on 1  whether papers adhere to the scientific format  2  the quality of writing  and 3  intellectual content  Because good scientific writing is an acquired skill  these reports are likely to be one of the most challenging aspects of the course  Accordingly  reports are worth 30  of the overall grade for the course  combined  Lt  Col  Paul Moosman Home Courses Research Publications Co curricular Interests VMI Foundation Keydet
