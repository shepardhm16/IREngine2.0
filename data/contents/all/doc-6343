vertebrates such as bats  amphibians and reptiles  While I am a conservation biologist at heart  you can t conserve something if you don t know anything about it  Therefore  most of my research attempts to inform the field of conservation by improving knowledge of ecology and natural history  Recent and ongoing projects are described below  Some of these have been featured on National Public Radio   you can listen to these interviews by visiting the following links  The Animal House  with host Sam Litzinger  30 October  2010  With Good Reason  with host Sarah McConnell  2 October  2010  Behavior and ecology of eastern small footed bats  The eastern small footed bat  Myotis leibii  is one of the rarest species of North American bats  Its populations are associated with exposed rock faces in mountainous portions of eastern North America  However  so few studies have been conducted on this species that wildlife managers don t know enough about their populations to know whether they are stable or declining  This lack of information will hamper any attempts to manage the species in the event populations ever do decline  Unfortunately  that situation appears to be upon us  The sudden arrival of White Nose Syndrome in the Northeast and its continued rapid spread into other parts of North America raises serious concerns for this and other species of bats  and highlights the need for basic ecological research  My students and I are addressing this problem by uncovering basic information about the ecology of M  leibii  such as their distribution  population status  diet and habitat needs  Basic information such as this will be critical for developing effective conservation plans  An adult eastern small footed bat  Myotis leibii  note the dark skin and small body size  Acquiring a bat s perspective on echolocation  an interdisciplinary approach to studying how bats use ultrasound to navigate and hunt  The ability of insectivorous bats to navigate and hunt with echolocation is impressive  but the amount of information they perceive with ultrasound remains poorly understood  Explanations about how bats echolocate are generally based on acoustic theory and are difficult to test empirically because most studies on echolocation have used stationary ground based microphones  The problem with ground based microphones is that they record bat calls and their echoes only after these have been influenced by the atmosphere and any number of objects in the environment  This makes interpretation of ground based recordings extremely difficult  To solve this problem  we developed instruments to record ultrasound calls and their resulting echoes in situ from free flying big brown bats  Eptesicus fuscus  The device has allowed us to successfully record vocalizations and the resulting echoes created by background vegetation  artificial targets  and flying insects  This work is ongoing and promises to produce valuable information for the field of bat biology  but also may have applications in technological fields such as rescue robotics  Click here to visit the project s web site   Setting mist nets to capture bats in New Hampshire Lt  Col  Paul
