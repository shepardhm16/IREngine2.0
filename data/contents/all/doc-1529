results  the high school record  foreign residency  and in some cases  a personal interview will all contribute to the recommendation for placement into an appropriate level course  It is possible for a cadet to place out of a portion or all of the language requirement  Placement credit means that a designated course does not have to be taken  However  semester credit hours are not awarded with placement credit and the required hours must be earned by taking elective courses  Dual Enrollment or Attendance at Another College  Subject to approval by appropriate curricular head  VMI will accept

activity in residence at VMI  Cadets matriculating with no advance standing credit must complete a minimum of six semesters or 75  of their degree requirements in residence at VMI  Decisions  The VMI

appropriate VMI curricular head toward fulfillment of baccalaureate degree requirements in that curriculum  Transfer courses that can be applied to degree requirements at VMI are determined by the curriculum selected  Transfer students are encouraged to review curriculum requirements in the VMI Catalogue to ensure appropriate course selection  No more than one half of the total hours required for VMI graduation may be transferred  Quality points are not transferable  Quality points earned at other colleges before transfer to VMI are not counted in the computation of the 2 0 quality point

Superintendent s decision will be final  Admission to VMI does not guarantee that a cadet will be eligible for commissioning  Only ROTC departments can determine eligibility for commissioning  Any questionable medical condition should be directed to the appropriate ROTC department  Applicants are advised that failure to report previously existing medical conditions will be grounds for termination of their cadetship with forfeiture of appropriate tuition and fees  Cadets who become unable to participate fully in all aspects of cadet life will be evaluated for retention on a case by

College Board and other test scores will be above average or better  Standardized Tests  The following standardized tests are required or recommended  as stated  for all applicants  REQUIRED  College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test  SAT I  or American College Testing Program  ACT  REQUIRED   if applicant s first language  mother tongue  is not English  College Board Test of English as a Foreign

Achievements  Since the VMI cadet is being trained for leadership  extracurricular achievement indicative of leadership potential  physical and moral stamina  and adaptability to a disciplined

editorship of student publications  athletic awards  significant civic or church work  and honors in such organizations as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts  Such achievements are not a substitute for academic qualifications  but they do represent an important supplement  Character Recommendations  Satisfactory character and personality evaluations must be furnished by the secondary school or schools attended by the applicant unless precluded by school policy  One or two letters of recommendation may be helpful if written by persons who know the applicant well  especially if the writer s relationship to the applicant has been that of teacher  employer  or leader in some significant activity  or if the writer is a VMI alumnus  Interviews and Visits  It is strongly recommended  though not required  that applicants visit VMI for an interview and a tour of the post  Both usually can be accomplished within a morning or afternoon  The Admissions Office will arrange for interviews and tours as far as possible to suit the convenience of the applicant  who should cite a preferred date when writing for an appointment  Preferred times Mon    Fri  are 9 11 30 a m  and 1 3 30 p m  Summary  The purpose of entrance requirements is to protect the standards of the college and also the interests of the applicant  which are not served if the applicant is accepted into a program for

Physical Education  Fitness Review Panel  Each member of the panel will submit a recommendation on eligibility to the Superintendent  The Superintendent s decision will be final  Admission to VMI does not guarantee that a cadet will be eligible for commissioning  Only ROTC departments can determine eligibility for commissioning  Any questionable medical condition should be directed to the appropriate ROTC department  Applicants are advised that failure to report previously existing medical conditions will be grounds for termination of their cadetship with forfeiture of appropriate tuition and fees  Cadets who become unable to participate fully in all aspects of cadet life will be evaluated for retention on a case by case basis by Institute officials  Academic Record  A college preparatory course comparable to the Commonwealth of Virginia s Advanced Studies Program  or higher  is preferred  The applicant should present a secondary school record showing at least 16 academic

better  Standardized Tests  The following standardized tests are required or recommended  as stated  for all applicants  REQUIRED  College Board Scholastic Aptitude Test  SAT I  or American College Testing Program  ACT  REQUIRED   if applicant s first language  mother tongue  is not English  College Board Test of English as a Foreign Language  TOEFL  The SAT or ACT should be taken in the senior

list of significant achievements would include membership in student government organizations  the National Honor Society  editorship of student publications  athletic awards  significant civic or church work  and honors in such organizations as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts  Such achievements are not a substitute for academic qualifications  but they do represent an important supplement  Character Recommendations  Satisfactory character and personality evaluations must be furnished by the secondary school or schools attended by the applicant unless precluded by school policy  One or two letters of recommendation may be helpful if written by persons who know the applicant well  especially if the writer s relationship to the applicant has been that of teacher  employer  or leader in some significant activity  or if the writer is a VMI alumnus  Interviews and Visits  It is strongly recommended  though not required  that applicants visit VMI for an interview and a tour of the post  Both usually can be accomplished within a morning or afternoon  The Admissions Office will arrange for interviews and tours as far as possible to suit the convenience of the applicant  who should cite a preferred date when writing for an appointment  Preferred times Mon    Fri  are 9 11 30 a m  and 1 3 30 p m  Summary  The purpose of entrance requirements is to protect the standards of

organizations as the Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts  Such achievements are not a substitute for academic qualifications  but they do represent an important supplement  Character Recommendations

academic qualifications  but they do represent an important supplement  Character Recommendations  Satisfactory character and personality evaluations must be furnished by the secondary school or schools attended by the applicant unless precluded by school policy  One or two letters of recommendation may be helpful if written by persons who know the applicant well  especially if the writer s

results  the high school record  foreign residency  and in some cases  a personal interview will all contribute to the recommendation for placement into an appropriate level course  It is possible for a cadet to place out of a portion or all of the language requirement  Placement credit means that a designated course does not have to be taken  However  semester credit hours are not awarded with placement credit and the required hours must be earned by taking elective courses  Dual Enrollment or Attendance at Another College  Subject to approval by appropriate curricular head  VMI will accept credits earned in another accredited college in advance of the applicant s matriculation  provided the course grade has been at least a  C  or the equivalent  Applicants should get advanced approval of course selections from the VMI Admissions Office  Transfer From Another College VMI welcomes applications from students wishing to transfer from another accredited college or university  The

activity in residence at VMI  Cadets matriculating with no advance standing credit must complete a minimum of six semesters or 75  of their degree requirements in residence at VMI  Decisions  The VMI

without regard to grades achieved on other courses of the same sequence or the average grade for the sequence  Credit transfer will also require that content of the course be acceptable by the appropriate VMI curricular head toward fulfillment of baccalaureate degree requirements in that curriculum  Transfer courses that can be applied to degree requirements at VMI are determined by the curriculum selected  Transfer students are encouraged to review curriculum requirements in the VMI Catalogue to ensure appropriate course selection  No more than one half of the total hours required for VMI graduation may be transferred  Quality points are not transferable  Quality points earned at other colleges before transfer to VMI are not counted in the computation of the 2 0 quality point average required for VMI graduation  Those students enrolled in another college must submit an official college transcript and catalogue in order to have these courses evaluated by the appropriate academic department head  Students enrolled in courses offered by the Virginia Community College System are directed to view the VCCS course listing in the VMI Transfer Guide to determine
