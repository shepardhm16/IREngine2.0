Peay for that kind introduction  I am disappointed that my wife Maryann can t be here tonight but she is in Staunton at a fund raiser for Stuart Hall School and as a major sponsor she had to attend  She also said she had heard me speak before and wasn t too concerned that she would miss anything I always love this occasion each year because it gives us a chance to bring cadet athletes  their parents  their donors and their coaches together to recognize their important contribution to the VMI experience  As a donor I want to especially thank the parents and guardians of these athletes for their support  VMI is a place where encouragement and support are indeed critical  I also want to thank the coaches and the cadet athletes for how you represent VMI and of course the donors whose financial support make so much of this possible  Your generosity makes it possible for these young people to participate in the sport they love while getting a world class education at an institution that will shape their life in almost every way  I want to thank Dr  Diles for his tireless work to help us be the best VMI can be athletically and of course I have to say how grateful I am that General Peay has been and continues to be so supportive of VMI athletics  When I thought about how I might craft some words that might be meaningful for this audience I started thinking about my time at VMI and what I hoped to do here in 1967 when I arrived in Lexington  My single ambition was to just get a college education  That was critical to me because no one in my family had ever gotten one and my father was 100  convinced the IF you had a college degree you would be set for life  I didn t know better and when I finally graduated I actually expected a long line of potential employers to line up and be dying to hire this redneck from Memphis Tennessee  Well that line was very very short  So I decided I was on my own and I began to pursuit my dream of being a college football coach  I wound up as an English teacher and football coach at Staunton Military Academy  through a VMI contact  and got my big break in 1974 when I was offered a job as a graduate assistant at Northeast Louisiana University tell NE LA story  I was 25 years old and my life s dream was over and that is when I decided to study what successful people do so I got a job   through a VMI contact  at a Pharmaceutical company and started really learn how to succeed in the business world  I remember one time my younger sister Joanne called me   her life s dream was to be an actress  She was all excited because she had gone to NYC to follow her dream  AIR FRANCE STORY  The lesson here is we can always learn a little bit more  Several years ago my friend Buzz Williams who was the head Basketball coach at Marquette asked me to speak to his team and share what I wish I knew when I was 22  That caused me to really think about what have I learned that I wish I knew long ago  Tonight I want to just share with you 5 of those things that I have learned that have meant so much to me  My sense is that whether you are a rat  in the graduating first class or a parent with all the responsibilities of family and work these may be worth some thought  The first one   everything matters  Every play matters  every class matters  every rebound matters  every parade matters  every test matters  everything matters  We never know when what we do will create wins and opportunities for us and that s why everything matters  You see my irresponsible approach to my academics when I was 19 and 20 cost me in a big way  It kept me from pursuing my dream  Everything matters  The second thing I learned along the way that I wish I knew earlier   Relationships aren t important they are everything  Our relationships with our families  our friends  our Creator  our brother rats  our co workers  our teammates  they define us  The quality of our life is directly related to the quality of our relationships  70  of all the jobs you will get in your entire life will be through your network  We need to build our networks with discipline and purpose because they will be what gets us through the good times and the bad times  The relationships you forge here and later in life with fellow alums will create a fullness in your life others will never know  Relationships are everything  Next   Obstacles are necessary for success  VMI was founded on this premise  There sure are a lot of obstacles here  But obstacles force us to get better or quit  You see it s ok to want to quit but it isn t ok to quit  Rats especially remember that  We must persist until we succeed because failure means nothing  if success eventually comes  Oliver Goldsmith said    Our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising very time we fall  In a book that sold 10 million copies Og Mandino said   It s not given to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal  Failure I may still encounter at the thousandth step  yet success hides just beyond the next bend in the road  And never will I know how close it lies unless I turn the corner  Never  ever give up  Success is never final and neither is failure unless we let it be  The 4th lesson for me was something I learned on May 16th 1969  Deaton Smith was the Valedictorian and in his valedictory address said this     A life without a sense of responsibility is a life without meaning  Knowing our purpose and why we strive is critical to extraordinary success  MLK had purpose  Abraham Lincoln had purpose  Rosa Parks had purpose  George Marshall had purpose  And each of them changed the world by living a purpose driven life  We must look for our purpose and find meaningful responsibility in our daily lives in order to make our difference in this world  No matter what we do we must never stop striving to make a meaningful contribution  That is true for everyone but I believe it is especially true if you have ever worn this uniform  Lastly  one of the greatest lessons of all for me is that when you give you get  Be a giver  Give your time  give your money  give your energy  give your enthusiasm to others  Givers are rewarded with abundance  Donnie Ross sat in my den 11 years ago and said to me   Jerry you are not doing enough for VMI  That phrase changed my life  At first when I gave to the Keydet Club and the Foundation I thought I was doing a good thing and felt proud to be supporting my alma mater  Little did I know the gifts I would get from our giving would be 10 times greater in meaning to me than whatever money we were contributing  I have been able to play a small part in the lives of athletes like Shawn Chapman  D J Covington  Quinton Upshur and my 3 main men in this room  Walker Hayes  Tim Marshall and Armani Branch  Just getting to know them and support their efforts and get to know their families is a gift of immeasurable worth  I am in touch to this day with every one of them and it s a constant reminder to me that giving doesn t cost it pays  Getting to meet and know the great coaches here  like Dan Earl and Scott Wachenheim and learn from them has also enriched my life beyond measure  So be a giver  Find a cause and look to have the same giving heart that someone else had that helped you in your athletic career  It will fill your life in a way that nothing else can  Let me close by saying   VMI has been an enormous gift to me  It s a gift that never stops giving  It gave me a world class education with incredible teachers  It gave me credibility when I had none  It gave me relationships that led me to a very rewarding career  It gave me leadership lessons at 21 that many people don t get until they are 30  It has given me relationships that have shaped and enriched my life  I believe there is some unfinished business in all of us  Each of us have things we still want to accomplish  All we can do is our best  But how will we know that we have done all we could  How will we know that we have utilized our gifts and talents to their fullest   I believe the answer is in the mirror  Many of you may have heard this poem  The Man in the Glass and I hope you will allow me to share it with you anyway because it says all I could ever say about giving to the world what the world needs and demands from us    The Man in the Glass When you get what you want in your struggle for self  And the world makes you king for a day  Just go to the mirror and look at yourself  And see what that man has to say  For it isn t your father or mother or wife  Who judgment upon you must pass  The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life  Is the one starring back from the glass  He s the fellow to please  never mind all the rest  For he s with you clear up to the end  And you ve passed the most dangerous  difficult test  If the man in the glass is your friend  You may be like Jack Horner and  chisel  a plum  And think you re a wonderful guy  But the man in the glass says you re only a bum  If you can t look him straight in the eye  You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years  And get pats on the back as you pass  But your final reward will be the heartaches and tears  If you ve cheated the man in the glass  Dale Wimbrow  c  1934  1895    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI   OUR MISSION  To

was very very short  So I decided I was on my own and I began to pursuit my dream of being a college football coach  I wound up as an English teacher and football coach at Staunton Military Academy  through a VMI contact  and got my big break in 1974 when I was offered a job as a graduate assistant at Northeast Louisiana University tell NE LA story  I was 25 years old and my life s dream was over and that is when I decided to study what successful people do so I got a job   through a VMI contact  at a Pharmaceutical company and started really learn how to succeed in the business world  I remember one time my younger sister Joanne called me   her life s dream was to be an actress  She was all excited because she had gone to NYC to follow her dream  AIR FRANCE STORY  The lesson here is we can always learn a little bit more  Several years ago my friend Buzz Williams who was the head Basketball coach at Marquette asked me to speak to his team and share what I wish I knew when I was 22  That caused me to really think about what have I learned that I wish I knew long ago  Tonight I want to just share with you 5 of those things that I have learned that have meant so much to me  My sense is that whether you are a rat  in the graduating first class or a parent with all the responsibilities of family and work these may be worth some thought  The first one   everything matters  Every play matters  every class matters  every rebound matters  every parade matters  every test matters  everything matters  We never know when what we do will create wins and opportunities for us and that s why everything matters  You see my irresponsible approach to my academics when I was 19 and 20 cost me in a big way  It kept me from pursuing my dream  Everything matters  The second thing I learned along the way that I wish I knew earlier   Relationships aren t important they are everything  Our relationships with our families  our friends  our Creator  our brother rats  our co workers  our teammates  they define us  The quality of our life is directly related to the quality of our relationships  70  of all the jobs you will get in your entire life will be through your network  We need to build our networks with discipline and purpose because they will be what gets us through the good times and the bad times  The relationships you forge here and later in life with fellow alums will create a fullness in your life others will never know  Relationships are everything  Next   Obstacles are necessary for success  VMI was founded on this premise  There sure are a lot of obstacles here  But obstacles force us to get better or quit  You see it s ok to want to quit but it isn t ok to quit  Rats especially remember that  We must persist until we succeed because failure means nothing  if success eventually comes  Oliver Goldsmith said    Our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising very time we fall  In a book that sold 10 million copies Og Mandino said   It s not given to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal  Failure I may still encounter at the thousandth step  yet success hides just beyond the next bend in the road  And never will I know how close it lies unless I turn the corner  Never  ever give up  Success is never final and neither is failure unless we let it be  The 4th lesson for me was something I learned on May 16th 1969  Deaton Smith was the Valedictorian and in his valedictory address said this     A life without a sense of responsibility is a life without meaning  Knowing our purpose and why we strive is critical to extraordinary success  MLK had purpose  Abraham Lincoln had purpose  Rosa Parks had purpose  George Marshall had purpose  And each of them changed the world by living a purpose driven life  We must look for our purpose and find meaningful responsibility in our daily lives in order to make our difference in this world  No matter what we do we must never stop striving to make a meaningful contribution  That is true for everyone but I believe it is especially true if you have ever worn this uniform  Lastly  one of the greatest lessons of all for me is that when you give you get  Be a giver  Give your time  give your money  give your energy  give your enthusiasm to others  Givers are rewarded with abundance  Donnie Ross sat in my den 11 years ago and said to me   Jerry you are not doing enough for VMI  That phrase changed my life  At first when I gave to the Keydet Club and the Foundation I thought I was doing a good thing and felt proud to be supporting my alma mater  Little did I know the gifts I would get from our giving would be 10 times greater in meaning to me than whatever money we were contributing  I have been able to play a small part in the lives of athletes like Shawn Chapman  D J Covington  Quinton Upshur and my 3 main men in this room  Walker Hayes  Tim Marshall and Armani Branch  Just getting to know them and support their efforts and get to know their families is a gift of immeasurable worth  I am in touch to this day with every one of them and it s a constant reminder to me that giving doesn t cost it pays  Getting to meet and know the great coaches here  like Dan Earl and Scott Wachenheim and learn from them has also enriched my life beyond measure  So be a giver  Find a cause and look to have the same giving heart that someone else had that helped you in your athletic career  It will fill your life in a way that nothing else can  Let me close by saying   VMI has been an enormous gift to me  It s a gift that never stops giving  It gave me a world class education with incredible teachers  It gave me credibility when I had none  It gave me relationships that led me to a very rewarding career  It gave me leadership lessons at 21 that many people don t get until they are 30  It has given me relationships that have shaped and enriched my life  I believe there is some unfinished business in all of us  Each of us have things we still want to accomplish  All we can do is our best  But how will we know that we have done all we could  How will we know that we have utilized our gifts and talents to their fullest   I believe the answer is in the mirror  Many of you may have heard this poem  The Man in the Glass and I hope you will allow me to share it with you anyway because it says all I could ever say about giving to the world what the world needs and demands from us    The Man in the Glass When you get what you want in your struggle for self  And the world makes you king for a day  Just go to the mirror and look at yourself  And see what that man has to say  For it isn t your father or mother or wife  Who judgment upon you must pass  The fellow whose verdict counts most in your life  Is the one starring back from the glass  He s the fellow to please  never mind all the rest  For he s with you clear up to the end  And you ve passed the most dangerous  difficult test  If the man in the glass is your friend  You may be like Jack Horner and  chisel  a plum  And think you re a wonderful guy  But the man in the glass says you re only a bum  If you can t look him straight in the eye  You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years  And get pats on the back as you pass  But your final reward will be the heartaches and tears  If you ve cheated the man in the glass  Dale Wimbrow  c  1934  1895

here tonight but she is in Staunton at a fund raiser for Stuart Hall School and as a major sponsor she had to attend  She also said she had heard me speak before and wasn t too concerned that she would miss anything I always love this occasion each year because it gives us a chance to bring cadet athletes  their parents  their donors and their coaches together to recognize their important contribution to the VMI experience  As a donor I want to especially thank the parents and guardians of these athletes for their support  VMI is a place where encouragement and support are indeed critical  I also want to thank the coaches and the cadet athletes for how you represent VMI and of course the donors whose financial support make so much of this possible  Your generosity makes it possible for these young people to participate in the sport they love while getting a world class education at an institution that will shape their life in almost every way  I want to thank Dr  Diles for his tireless work to help us be the best VMI can be athletically and of course I have to say how grateful I am that General Peay has been and continues to be so supportive of VMI athletics  When I thought about how I might craft some words that might be meaningful for this audience I started thinking about my time at VMI and what I hoped to do here in 1967 when I arrived in Lexington  My single

shape their life in almost every way  I want to thank Dr  Diles for his tireless work to help us be the best VMI can be athletically and of course I have to say how grateful I am that General Peay has been and continues to be so supportive of VMI athletics  When I thought about how I might craft some words that might be meaningful for this audience I started thinking about my time at VMI and what I hoped to do here in 1967 when I arrived in Lexington  My single ambition was to just get a college education  That was critical to me because no one in my family had ever gotten one and my father was 100  convinced the IF you had a college degree you would be set for life  I didn t know better and when I finally graduated I actually expected a long line of potential employers to line up and be dying to hire this redneck from Memphis Tennessee  Well that line was very very short  So I decided I was on my own and I began to pursuit my dream of being a college football coach  I wound up as an English teacher and football coach at Staunton Military Academy  through a VMI contact  and got my big break in 1974 when I was offered a job as a graduate assistant at Northeast Louisiana University tell NE LA story  I was 25 years old and my life s dream was over and that is when I decided to study what successful people do so I got a job   through a VMI contact  at a Pharmaceutical company and started really learn how to succeed in the business world  I remember one time my younger sister Joanne called me   her life s dream was to be an actress  She was all excited because she had gone to NYC to follow her dream  AIR FRANCE STORY  The lesson here is we can always learn a little bit more  Several years ago my friend Buzz Williams who was the head Basketball coach at Marquette asked me to speak to his team and share what I wish I knew when I was 22  That caused me to really think about what have I learned that I wish I knew long ago  Tonight I want to just share with you 5 of those things that I have learned that have meant so much to me  My sense is that whether you are a rat  in the graduating first class or a parent with all the responsibilities of family and work these may be worth some thought  The first one   everything matters  Every play matters  every class matters  every rebound matters  every parade matters  every test matters  everything matters  We never know when what we do will create wins and opportunities for us and that s why everything matters  You see my irresponsible approach to my academics when I was 19 and 20 cost me in a big way  It kept me from pursuing my dream  Everything matters  The second thing I learned along the way that I wish I knew earlier   Relationships aren t important they are everything  Our relationships with our families  our friends  our Creator  our brother rats  our co workers  our teammates  they define us  The quality of our life is directly related to the quality of our relationships  70  of all the jobs you will get in your entire life will be through your network  We need to build our networks with discipline and purpose because they will be what gets us through the good times and the bad times  The relationships you forge here and later in life with fellow alums will create a fullness in your life others will never know  Relationships are everything  Next   Obstacles are necessary for success  VMI was founded on this premise  There sure are a lot of obstacles here  But obstacles force us to get better or quit  You see it s ok to want to quit but it isn t ok to quit  Rats especially remember that  We must persist until we succeed because failure means nothing  if success eventually comes  Oliver Goldsmith said    Our greatest glory consists not in never falling but in rising very time we fall  In a book that sold 10 million copies Og Mandino said   It s not given to know how many steps are necessary in order to reach my goal  Failure I may still encounter at the thousandth step  yet success hides just beyond the next bend in the road  And never will I know how close it lies unless I turn the corner  Never  ever give up  Success is never final and neither is failure unless we let it be  The 4th lesson for me was something I learned on May 16th 1969  Deaton Smith was the Valedictorian and in his valedictory address said this     A life without a sense of responsibility is a life without meaning  Knowing our purpose and why we strive is critical to extraordinary success  MLK had purpose  Abraham Lincoln had purpose  Rosa Parks had purpose  George Marshall had purpose  And each of them changed the world by living a purpose driven life  We must look for our purpose and find meaningful responsibility in our daily lives in order to make our difference in this world  No matter what we do we must never stop striving to make a meaningful contribution  That is true for everyone but I believe it is especially true if you have ever worn this uniform  Lastly  one of the greatest lessons of all for me is that when you give you get  Be a giver  Give your time  give your money  give your energy  give your enthusiasm to others  Givers are rewarded with abundance  Donnie Ross sat in my den 11 years ago and said to me   Jerry you are not doing enough for VMI  That phrase changed my life  At first when I gave to the Keydet Club and the Foundation I thought I was doing a good thing and felt proud to be supporting my alma mater  Little did I know the gifts I would get from our giving would be 10 times greater in meaning to me than whatever money we were contributing  I have been able to play a small part in the lives of athletes like Shawn Chapman  D J Covington  Quinton Upshur and my 3 main men in this room  Walker Hayes  Tim Marshall and Armani Branch  Just getting to know them and support their efforts and get to know their families is a gift of immeasurable worth  I am in touch to this day with every one of them and it s a constant reminder to me that giving doesn t cost it pays  Getting to meet and know the great coaches here  like Dan Earl and Scott Wachenheim and learn from them has also enriched my life beyond measure  So be a giver  Find a cause and look to have the same giving heart that someone else had that helped you in your athletic career  It will fill your life in a way that nothing else can  Let me

How will we know that we have utilized our gifts and talents to their fullest   I believe the answer is in the mirror  Many of you may have heard this poem  The Man in the Glass and I hope you will allow me to share it with you anyway because it says all I could ever say about giving to the world what the world needs and demands from us    The Man in the Glass When you get what you want in your

words that might be meaningful for this audience I started thinking about my time at VMI and what I hoped to do here in 1967 when I arrived in Lexington  My single ambition was to just get a college education  That was critical to me because no one in my family had ever gotten one and my father was 100  convinced the IF you had a college degree you would be set for life  I didn t know better and when I finally graduated I actually expected a long line of potential employers to line up and be dying to hire this redneck from Memphis Tennessee  Well that line was very very short  So I decided I was on my own and I began to pursuit my dream of being a college football coach  I wound up as an English teacher and football coach at Staunton Military Academy  through a VMI contact  and got my big
