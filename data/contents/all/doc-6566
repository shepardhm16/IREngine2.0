Safety Invention Richard Hammond Finds New Use for Professors  Mine Safety Invention It s a pretty safe bet that when Col  Jay Sullivan and Col  Jim Squire were designing a device to help rescue trapped miners  they never once thought about an elephant  But in early June 2012  the two VMI professors found themselves surrounded by pachyderms in sub Saharan Africa  in a BBC production  Richard Hammond s Miracles of Nature  starring daredevil broadcast journalist Hammond  of Top Gear fame  The purpose of their journey was to demonstrate how their extremely low frequency seismic detector  or ELF SD  could be used to replicate the way elephants communicate with one another over long distances  What Sullivan  a professor of mechanical engineering  calls  the trip of a lifetime  began in February  when a researcher got in touch with the VMI duo to ask about the animal communication possibilities of the ELF SD   The idea was to take a look at all sorts of cool animal abilities  said Squire  a professor of electrical and computer engineering at VMI  Squire and Sullivan had been inspired to create the ELF SD after the Sago Mine disaster killed 12 coal miners in West Virginia in 2006  The two professors  along with then Cadet Will Flathers  08  sought to create a device that could send signals through solid rock  so people trapped hundreds of feet underground would have a way to communicate their whereabouts to the surface  The device was patented in 2010  and is now awaiting federal approval before commercial production can begin  When Squire and Sullivan first heard from the show s producers  they were surprised  to say the least   We had no idea who Richard Hammond was because we don t watch enough television  I guess  but he s a big deal  said Sullivan   If you ask the cadets  they all know who is because they all watch his show  Top Gear  Sullivan continued   We were thinking about miners  and all of a sudden somebody started talking about the seismic communication aspect of  the ELF SD  Squire explained that the TV show s staff had found out about the ELF through a Web search on seismic signaling  At first  Squire and Sullivan were asked to travel to Rosamond  Calif  to demonstrate the ELF SD s usefulness in the staged explosion of an abandoned gold mine  They made the trip over Easter weekend  and despite several setbacks  including the device itself being broken in transit and Squire s laptop computer getting  fried  by the X ray machine at the airport  they were able to demonstrate the ELF SD s ability to send signals through several hundred feet of rock  Squire and Sullivan returned to Virginia after the gold mine episode was filmed  thinking that they had done their part for Hammond s show  Two weeks later  they were invited to travel with Hammond and his team to Botswana  where they were to demonstrate that the ELF SD could also be used to mimic the ultra low frequency waves that elephants use to communicate with one another  Elephants produce such waves in their vocalizations  and scientists believe that those waves can then be transmitted through the ground  The weeks between receiving the invitation in April and departure in early June were spent packaging the ELF SD for trans Atlantic shipping and finding a company capable of shipping it  In the end  the producers of the show paid approximately  3 000 in shipping fees for the 140 pound device   and for a brief moment upon the device s arrival in South Africa  it looked like they might have to pay more  Sullivan explained that the ELF SD got hung up in customs  with South African officials demanding payment of a fee before it could be released   You get the feeling that you re not in Kansas anymore  said Sullivan  For a moment  Sullivan and Squire didn t know what would happen  but then a  fixer    an employee of the wildlife filming company Afriscreen Films   simply demanded that the ELF SD be freed  and the officials relented immediately   The fixers were rugged individuals  said Sullivan   They re very smart people  They know how to get stuff done  They have to be  When Squire and Sullivan joined the ELF SD in Botswana  after a journey that included a 14  hour flight from New York City to Johannesburg  they found a luxurious camp in the heart of the African bush   one that had already gained fame as a favorite getaway of Princes William and Harry of Great Britain  Camp Meno a Kwena  which translates into  Teeth of the Crocodile  boasted tents that were a far cry from those Americans might remember from summer camp   these had real beds with linens  rugs on the floor  and even shaving stands  used each morning after an African servant supplied hot water  Visitors took showers outdoors  after servants had filled 10 gallon bags with hot water  Solar lights provided illumination   It really looked like something out of  Raiders of the Lost Ark  said Squire of the camp  He added that the noise of animals  such as elephants  hippos  and zebras coming to drink in the nearby Boteti River  was a constant backdrop   It felt very much like an 1890s safari adventure  added Sullivan  He recalls an abundance of delicious food  plus French press coffee  There were even a few phone calls home  thanks to the iPhones carried by the British film crew  Working in the field meant spending several hours setting up the ELF SD and then waiting for elephants to show up  The episode of Miracles of Nature featuring the ELF SD  which is now available on YouTube  shows a herd of bull elephants doing a rather abrupt U turn in the device s direction when the ELF SD was turned on and set to the frequency of a female elephant  Squire and Sullivan  though  bring a scientist s skepticism to the behavior observed   It certainly seemed like they did  respond to the ELF SD s  signals  said Squire   But the jury s still out for me  It did seem like it was happening more often than chance would dictate  For his part  Sullivan said he d like to see a more controlled experiment   The elephants  responded to it  he said   The question in my mind is   Was it solely through the ground that they were feeling this  There s always the possibility that they were hearing the ELF SD s frequencies as well as feeling them  he explained  With their moment of televised fame behind them  the two professors and co inventors have turned their attention to another one of their inventions  a robot designed to remove ticks from people s yards and thereby stem the spread of Lyme disease  The  tick rover  which was patented in 2006  is scheduled to be tested this spring at Old Dominion University  said Squire   We have ideas  said Sullivan  referring to himself and Squire   We always have ideas   We ve had a great association working with each other on different things  On a number of occasions  we ve done work where we didn t have any realistic expectation of being successful but we rallied and were able to fix things    We ve had a really good run here  knock on wood  By   Mary Price IR   Feb  2013  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT
