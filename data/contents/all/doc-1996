The Maury River Area and Geologic Surroundings Geology The Maury River has been cutting its channel downward over many millions of years  that process  along with blasting for the railroad and canals  exposed large sections of cliff face along the trail  Users should beware of falling rocks along these sections and refrain from standing too close to the rocks  Along the trail  users can see evidence of the Alleghenian Orogeny   the most recent period of mountain building in the area  Many of the sedimentary rock layers seen along the trail were formed when this area was an ancient sea before the mountains were formed  As the Maury River has deepened its path  it  like most rivers  has undercut banks on the outside of curves and meanders  This can cause small landslides as banks collapse into the stream  and trail users might see spots of erosion at the edges of the trail as a result  The Chessie Trail is located in the Valley and Ridge physiographic province  which contains younger rocks formed in the Cambrian Period  early in the Paleozoic Era  These rocks are much younger than those found in the Blue Ridge  The sedimentary rocks seen along the trail were folded and faulted during the mountain building that formed the Appalachians  Rock formations seen along the trail include  starting with the Lexington end  the Edinburg Formation  Conococheague Formation  and Elbrook Formation  The deformation of these sedimentary rocks becomes apparent when examining the layering visible along the trail  Deformation can be observed on a large scale  massive rock outcrops  or a small scale  folds in the small scale layers of sediment  Toward the Buena Vista end of the trail  users will see many caves higher up in the rock face  these were formed from the dissolution of limestone bedrock long after the area s mountain building event  Hydrology Two U S  Geological Service gauging stations are present along the Maury  with one visible along the trail downstream of the confluence with South River  The highest flooding on record in the area was in August of 1969 when Hurricane Camille struck the area  The height of the water at that point would have covered the Chessie Trail with 10 15 feet of water  This flood halted the railroad usage in the area  and various other floods have washed out pedestrian bridges  at South River and Jordan s Point  and done further damage to the trail  Water Quality The Maury River has relatively high quality water  but is degraded along the trail as polluted tributaries flow into the river  Along the trail  the watershed shifts from forest dominated to agriculture dominated  Agricultural operations tend to contribute large amounts of nitrogen  phosphorus  fecal coliform  and sediment   some of the most serious pollutants in aquatic ecosystems  through runoff  Parking lots  interstates  buildings  and other city infrastructure also contribute high levels of pollution  Rockbridge County is part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed  and water seen along the trail will eventually end up there  Just as polluted tributaries lower the water quality of the Maury  the Chesapeake Bay suffers from severe pollution that it receives from all of its upstream tributaries   spanning four states  Land use practices and poor pollution management in watersheds can compound pollution downstream  whether it is in the Maury River or the Chesapeake Bay  These issues can only be mediated through a watershed based approach that considers all connecting waterways  The city of Lexington gets its water from the Maury River not far upstream of the start of the trail  The Maury Service Authority outflow pipe  carrying water after being treated by the Wastewater Treatment Plant  flows back into the river along the trail   a typical way to dispose of treated water  Wastewater treatment plant effluent can pollute waterways because of high levels of nitrogen  chlorine  sodium  fluoride  and other chemicals  Although aquatic ecosystems require and use nitrogen  any excess is passed downstream and becomes a problematic pollutant  An upgrade project  completed in December 2011  was necessary for the treatment plant to comply with new nutrient limits  The project will help reduce the local area s pollution contribution to the James River and the Chesapeake Bay  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
