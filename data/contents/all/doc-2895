conclusions into an acceptable final thesis  and to defend it in a second examination Entry into the honors program is voluntary  and although every qualified cadet is invited to apply for admission  none is under any pressure to do so  Admission to the program is not automatic  the departmental honors committee made up of three standing members screens candidates and consults with the potential

faculty mentor for the project To apply  a history major must have at least a 3 200 GPA in history  History 103 104  200  205 206  plus any other history courses taken through the cadet s first five
