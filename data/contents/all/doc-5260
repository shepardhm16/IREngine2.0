was the Superintendent of the Virginia Military Institute  Richardson was Adjutant General of Virginia  The final section of the letter is partially illegible  Brackets are used to indicate uncertainty in transcription  Head Quarters Virginia Mil  Institute Lynchburg  Va  June 17  1864 Maj  Gen  Wm  H  Richardson  A G  General  I have the honor to report that immediately on the receipt of the orders of the Governor  transmitted through your office under date of June 6  1864  I moved the Corps of Cadets from their camp near Richmond  and taking the Danville train on the morning of the 7th reached Lynchburg at 11 P M  Hearing at Lynchburg that the enemy was threatening Lexington from Staunton and that Gen  McCausland s command was resisting his advance  I determined to move immediately to Lexington to his support  The cadets were transported by freight boats back to the mouth of the North River  and marched into Lexington on Thursday  June 9  at 3 P M  On Friday  June 10  intelligence was brought to me from Gen  McCausland that the enemy in strong force  estimated by him at 10 000  was advancing on the two main roads from Staunton to Lexington  and by 7 P M  his command had been driven back from 1 1 2 miles of Staunton to Cameron s farm 2 miles from Lexington  I had a very long interview with Gen  McCausland that night  and said to him  that if  with the support of the Corps of Cadets  he could make an effective resistance  and save the town of Lexington  and with it  the public property placed in charge of the Corps of Cadets at the V M  Institute  I was prepared to make any sacrifice necessary to this end  But if a sanguinary resistance in front of Lexington could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  involving thereby a useless sacrifice of life and endangering the capture of the cadets by a flank movement on either side of the town  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or to run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think he could hold the position without support from Gen  Breckinridge  but he deeming it important to retard the advance of the enemy  I determined to hold the cadets on their  ground or guard  ready to give support if required  upon the conditions above specified  with the understanding that  early  notice should be given  for them  to withdraw when resistance was no longer effectual  A courier was immediately dispatched by me to Lynchburg with intelligence of the state of things to Gen  Bragg and Breckinridge and the Governor which I desired Gen  Nicholl s command at Lynchburg to transmit by telegram  About 8 A M  on the 11th intimation was given to me of the advance of the enemy towards the town and at 9 A M  three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills on the north side of the North River  Gen  McCausland having destroyed the bridge over the North River  planted a section of artillery on the Magazine hill  and occupied the adjacent hills south of the river with sharpshooters  Firing soon commenced  and an active artillery fire was kept up for several hours  without loss to our side  By 1 o clock it became evident that the enemy had crossed above Leyburn s mills  and was advancing by Kerr s Creek  I deemed it prudent at once to withdraw and gave orders to Lt  Col  Ship to move by the Fair Grounds road and cross the N  River by the bridge at its mouth  and encamp near Balcony Falls that night  At 2 1 2 P M  Gen  McCausland withdrew with his command   proceeded by the Fancy Hill road towards Buchanan  strongly pressed by the enemy who entered the town at 3 1 2 P M  As guard   protection to the citizens who were moving their servants   stock by the James River  to Bedford and Amherst  I determined to hold the pass at the Balcony Falls  Effective protection was thus given to a large amount of private property  while I was not without the hope that withdrawal of the enemy from Lexington might enable us to return  A raid  however  upon Amherst  and the advance of Averill   pursuit of McCausland into Bedford  made it unsafe to remain above Waugh s Ferry  and Wednesday I gave orders to to retire towards Lynchburg  We met a dispatch on the way from Gen  Breckinridge directing the movement  and at 8 A M  on Thursday the 16th we arrived in Lynchburg  and I immediately reported by telegraph to your office  for the orders of the Governor   Board of Visitors  On Sunday the 12 June all the public buildings of the Institute were burnt by the order of Major General D  Hunter  except my quarters and the quarters of the ordnance Sergeant  The peculiar condition of my daughter  with a child only 48 hours old  induced my wife  Sarah Henderson Smith  to throw herself upon the courtesy of the commanding General  The appeal was not in vain  and I acknowledge with pleasure  this relaxation of the devastation which was unsparingly applied to every species of property owned by the state at the V Mil  Institute  which we were unable to remove  The beautiful statue of Washington cast by Hubard from Houdon s model  was removed  I have brought with the command 4 Brass pieces  2 rifle guns 3 in  and ammunition  and had privately disposed of the section of the Letcher Battery given to the Institute  The mountain Howitzers  ammunition and old cadet muskets were turned over to the Confederate authorities  and I hold the receipt of the commanding officer at Lexington for them  I understand they were caught above the break in the canal  and were destroyed or captured  The most valuable part of the Library and Philosophical apparatus with the paintings had been removed to Washington College and to the houses of friends  I have not heard whether they had been removed or destroyed  The residence of Governor Letcher  with all his effects  was destroyed  and I have heard  the  house was searched and robbed of the essentials of life  especially of flour   meat  In a time of war it was not to be expected that the Va  Mil  Institute should escape the effects of the devastations which has visited by fire and rapine the fairest portions of our beloved commonwealth  and the apprehension of its capture became more serious as the necessities of the hour withdrew from from our support  the army  that  had defended the Valley of Va  It was a painful contemplation to all associated with the Va  Mil  Institute  to know  that the buildings erected by the liberality of the state for the use of her favored military school  were in the hands of the spoiler and when the clouds of heaven reflected the conflagration lighted by the torch of the invader  every eye was moistened that the home of the V M I  cadet was gone  But the Virginia Military Institute still proudly and defiantly stands  The brick and mortar which gave a temporary shelter to her nurturing sons  while they were buckling on the armor for the conflict  constituted not the Military school of Virginia  Thank God  that still lives  The Governor its Board of Visitors its Professors its cadets still remain in organized being  ready to work and able to send forth  year by year  its alumni  to fill up the ranks of those who have fallen in the deadly struggle  Some inconvenience will attend its losses but all are prepared to sacrifice comfort to promote the end of our Revolution  and all become apt scholars when the trials of persecution give spirit and point to the motive which animates them  It cheers the heart of the patriot   especially of every friend of the V M  Institute to witness the filial affection displayed by the cadets as they cluster around the proud standard committed to their charge by the Governor of Va  Homeless but not defenseless  night by night they pitch their moving camp  but around the camp fires there is a tie of brotherhood which bonds heart to heart  as each remembers he is a V M I  cadet  Some such spirit as this was indeed to have been expected by those of us who have watched the progress of the Institute from its first inception in 1839  and who have been familiar with the peculiar difficulties by which it has been surrounded  But the cheerful alacrity in the discharge of every duty  the patient endurance under great hardships  such only as veterans are accustomed to  and the buoyant spirit  not daunted by the late disaster  speak in  tones  which far transcend any description  and  can   stand  as hopeful auguries upon which to maintain and  support  the Military Institute  At present all our supplies are exhausted  except some 50 head of cattle should they

Virginia Mil  Institute Lynchburg  Va  June 17  1864 Maj  Gen  Wm  H  Richardson  A G  General  I have the honor to report that immediately on the receipt of the orders of the Governor  transmitted through your office under date of June 6  1864  I moved the Corps of Cadets from their camp near Richmond  and taking the Danville train on the morning of the 7th reached Lynchburg at 11 P M  Hearing at Lynchburg that the enemy was threatening Lexington from Staunton and that Gen  McCausland s command was resisting his advance  I determined to move immediately to Lexington to his support  The cadets were transported by freight boats back to the mouth of the North River  and marched into Lexington on Thursday  June 9  at 3 P M  On Friday  June 10  intelligence was brought to me from Gen  McCausland that the enemy in strong force  estimated by him at 10 000  was advancing on the two main roads from Staunton to Lexington  and by 7 P M  his command had been driven back from 1 1 2 miles of Staunton to Cameron s farm 2 miles from Lexington  I had a very long interview with Gen  McCausland that night  and said to him  that if  with the support of the Corps of Cadets  he could make an effective resistance  and save the town of Lexington  and with it  the public property placed in charge of the Corps of Cadets at the V M  Institute  I was prepared to make any sacrifice necessary to this end  But if a sanguinary resistance in front of Lexington could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  involving thereby a useless sacrifice of life and endangering the capture of the cadets by a flank movement on either side of the town  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or to run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think he could hold the position without support from Gen  Breckinridge  but he deeming it important to retard the advance of the enemy  I determined to hold the cadets on their  ground or guard  ready to give support if required  upon the conditions above specified  with the understanding that  early  notice should be given  for them  to withdraw when resistance was no longer effectual  A courier was immediately dispatched by me to Lynchburg with intelligence of the state of things to Gen  Bragg and Breckinridge and the Governor which I desired Gen  Nicholl s command at Lynchburg to transmit by telegram  About 8 A M  on the 11th intimation was given to me of the advance of the enemy towards the town and at 9 A M  three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills on the north side of the North River  Gen  McCausland having destroyed the bridge over the North River  planted a section of artillery on the Magazine hill  and occupied the adjacent hills south of the river with sharpshooters  Firing soon commenced  and an active artillery fire was kept up for several hours  without loss to our side  By 1 o clock it became evident that the enemy had crossed above Leyburn s mills  and was advancing by Kerr s Creek  I deemed it prudent at once to withdraw and gave orders to Lt  Col  Ship to move by the Fair Grounds road and cross the N  River by the bridge at its mouth  and encamp near Balcony Falls that night  At 2 1 2 P M  Gen  McCausland withdrew with his command   proceeded by the Fancy Hill road towards Buchanan  strongly pressed by the enemy who entered the town at 3 1 2 P M  As guard   protection to the citizens who were moving their servants   stock by the James River  to Bedford and Amherst  I determined to hold the pass at the Balcony Falls  Effective protection was thus given to a large amount of private property  while I was not without the hope that withdrawal of the enemy from Lexington might enable us to return  A raid  however  upon Amherst  and the advance of Averill   pursuit of McCausland into Bedford  made it unsafe to remain above Waugh s Ferry  and Wednesday I gave orders to to retire towards Lynchburg  We met a dispatch on the way from Gen  Breckinridge directing the movement  and at 8 A M  on Thursday the 16th we arrived in Lynchburg  and I immediately reported by telegraph to your office  for the orders of the Governor   Board of Visitors  On Sunday the 12 June all the public buildings of the Institute were burnt by the order of Major General D  Hunter  except my quarters and the quarters of the ordnance Sergeant  The peculiar condition of my daughter  with a child only 48 hours old  induced my wife  Sarah Henderson Smith  to throw herself upon the courtesy of the commanding General  The appeal was not in vain  and I acknowledge with pleasure  this relaxation of the devastation which was unsparingly applied to every species of property owned by the state at the V Mil  Institute  which we were unable to remove  The beautiful statue of Washington cast by Hubard from Houdon s model  was removed  I have brought with the command 4 Brass pieces  2 rifle guns 3 in  and ammunition  and had privately disposed of the section of the Letcher Battery given to the Institute  The mountain Howitzers  ammunition and old cadet muskets were turned over to the Confederate authorities  and I hold the receipt of the commanding officer at Lexington for them  I understand they were caught above the break in the canal  and were destroyed or captured  The most valuable part of the Library and Philosophical apparatus with the paintings had been removed to Washington College and to the houses of friends  I have not heard whether they had been removed or destroyed  The residence of Governor Letcher  with all his effects  was destroyed  and I have heard  the  house was searched and robbed of the essentials of life  especially of flour   meat  In a time of war it was not to be expected that the Va  Mil  Institute should escape the effects of the devastations which has visited by fire and rapine the fairest portions of our beloved commonwealth  and the apprehension of its capture became more serious as the necessities of the hour withdrew from from our support  the army  that  had defended the Valley of Va  It was a painful contemplation to all associated with the Va  Mil  Institute  to know  that the buildings erected by the liberality of the state for the use of her favored military school  were in the hands of the spoiler and when the clouds of heaven reflected the conflagration lighted by the torch of the invader  every eye was moistened that the home of the V M I  cadet was gone  But the Virginia Military Institute still proudly and defiantly stands  The brick and mortar which gave a temporary shelter to her nurturing sons  while they were buckling on the armor for the conflict  constituted not the Military school of Virginia  Thank God  that still lives  The Governor its Board of Visitors its Professors its cadets still remain in organized being  ready to work and able to send forth  year by year  its alumni  to fill up the ranks of those who have fallen in the deadly struggle  Some inconvenience will attend its losses but all are prepared to sacrifice comfort to promote the end of our Revolution  and all become apt scholars when the trials of persecution give spirit and point to the motive which animates them  It cheers the heart of the patriot   especially of every friend of the V M  Institute to witness the filial affection displayed by the cadets as they cluster around the proud standard committed to their charge by the Governor of Va  Homeless but not defenseless  night by night they pitch their moving camp  but around the camp fires there is a tie of brotherhood which bonds heart to heart  as each remembers he is a V M I  cadet  Some such spirit as this was indeed to have been expected by those of us who have watched the progress of the Institute from its first inception in 1839  and who have been familiar with the peculiar difficulties by which it has been surrounded  But the cheerful alacrity in the discharge of every duty  the patient endurance under great hardships  such only as veterans are accustomed to  and the buoyant spirit  not daunted by the late disaster  speak in  tones  which far transcend any description  and  can   stand  as hopeful auguries upon which to maintain and  support  the Military Institute  At present all our supplies are exhausted  except some 50 head of cattle should they have  to be of use  They were in good hands  The academic year was near its close    supplies were low of necessity  Flour   bacon may be obtained by the fall  if a suitable place can be provided  until the building can be repaired  Its walls are good  The following places

Lynchburg  Va  June 17  1864 Maj  Gen  Wm  H  Richardson  A G  General  I have the honor to report that immediately on the receipt of the orders of the Governor  transmitted through your office under date of June 6  1864  I moved the Corps of Cadets from their camp near Richmond  and taking the Danville train on the morning of the 7th reached Lynchburg at 11 P M  Hearing at Lynchburg that the enemy was threatening Lexington from Staunton and that Gen  McCausland s command was resisting his advance  I determined to move immediately to Lexington to his support  The cadets were transported by freight boats back to the mouth of the North River  and marched into Lexington on Thursday  June 9  at 3 P M  On Friday  June 10  intelligence was brought to me from Gen  McCausland that the enemy in strong force  estimated by him at 10 000  was advancing on the two main roads from Staunton to Lexington  and by 7 P M  his command had been driven back from 1 1 2 miles of Staunton to Cameron s farm 2 miles from Lexington  I had a very long interview with Gen  McCausland that night  and said to him  that if  with the support of the Corps of Cadets  he could make an effective resistance  and save the town of Lexington  and with it  the public property placed in charge of the Corps of Cadets at the V M  Institute  I was prepared to make any sacrifice necessary to this end  But if a sanguinary resistance in front of Lexington could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  involving thereby a useless sacrifice of life and endangering the capture of the cadets by a flank movement on either side of the town  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or to run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think he could hold the position without support from Gen  Breckinridge  but he deeming it important to retard the advance of the enemy  I determined to hold the cadets on their  ground or guard  ready to give support if required  upon the conditions above specified  with the understanding that  early  notice should be given  for them  to withdraw when resistance was no longer effectual  A courier was immediately dispatched by me to Lynchburg with intelligence of the state of things to Gen  Bragg and Breckinridge and the Governor which I desired Gen  Nicholl s command at Lynchburg to transmit by telegram  About 8 A M  on the 11th intimation was given to me of the advance of the enemy towards the town and at 9 A M  three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills on the north side of the North River  Gen  McCausland having destroyed the bridge over the North River  planted a section of artillery on the Magazine hill  and occupied the adjacent hills south of the river with sharpshooters  Firing soon commenced  and an active artillery fire was kept up for several hours  without loss to our side  By 1 o clock it became evident that the enemy had crossed above Leyburn s mills  and was advancing by Kerr s Creek  I deemed it prudent at once to withdraw and gave orders to Lt  Col  Ship to move by the Fair Grounds road and cross the N  River by the bridge at its mouth  and encamp near Balcony Falls that night  At 2 1 2 P M  Gen  McCausland withdrew with his command   proceeded by the Fancy Hill road towards Buchanan  strongly pressed by the enemy who entered the town at 3 1 2 P M  As guard   protection to the citizens who were moving their servants   stock by the James River  to Bedford and Amherst  I determined to hold the pass at the Balcony Falls  Effective protection was thus given to a large amount of private property  while I was not without the hope that withdrawal of the enemy from Lexington might enable us to return  A raid  however  upon Amherst  and the advance of Averill   pursuit of McCausland into Bedford  made it unsafe to remain above Waugh s Ferry  and Wednesday I gave orders to to retire towards Lynchburg  We met a dispatch on the way from Gen  Breckinridge directing the movement  and at 8 A M  on Thursday the 16th we arrived in Lynchburg  and I immediately reported by telegraph to your office  for the orders of the Governor   Board of Visitors  On Sunday the 12 June all the public buildings of the Institute were burnt by the order of Major General D  Hunter  except my quarters and the quarters of the ordnance Sergeant  The peculiar condition of my daughter  with a child only 48 hours old  induced my wife  Sarah Henderson Smith  to throw herself upon the courtesy of the commanding General  The appeal was not in vain  and I acknowledge with pleasure  this relaxation of the devastation which was

of Virginia  The final section of the letter is partially illegible  Brackets are used to indicate uncertainty in transcription  Head Quarters Virginia Mil  Institute Lynchburg  Va  June 17  1864 Maj  Gen  Wm  H  Richardson  A G  General  I have the honor to report that immediately on the receipt of the orders of the Governor  transmitted through your office under date of June 6  1864  I moved the Corps of Cadets from their camp near Richmond  and taking the Danville train on the morning of the 7th reached Lynchburg at 11 P M  Hearing at Lynchburg that the enemy was threatening Lexington from Staunton and that Gen  McCausland s command was resisting his advance  I determined to move immediately to Lexington to his support  The cadets were transported by freight boats back to the mouth of the North River  and marched into Lexington on Thursday  June 9  at 3 P M  On Friday  June 10  intelligence was brought to me from Gen  McCausland that the enemy in strong force  estimated by him at 10 000  was advancing on the two main roads from Staunton to Lexington  and by 7 P M  his command had been driven back from 1 1 2 miles of Staunton to Cameron s farm 2 miles from Lexington  I had a very long interview with Gen  McCausland that night  and said to him  that if  with the support of the Corps of Cadets  he could make an effective resistance  and save the town of Lexington  and with it  the public property placed in charge of the Corps of Cadets at the V M  Institute  I was prepared to make any sacrifice necessary to this end  But if a sanguinary resistance in front of Lexington could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  involving thereby a useless sacrifice of life and endangering the capture of the cadets by a flank movement on either side of the town  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or to run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think he could hold the position without support from Gen  Breckinridge  but he deeming it important to retard the advance of the enemy  I determined to hold the cadets on their  ground or guard  ready to give support if required  upon the conditions above specified  with the understanding that  early  notice should be given  for them  to withdraw when resistance was no longer effectual  A courier was immediately dispatched by me to Lynchburg with intelligence of the state of things to Gen  Bragg and Breckinridge and the Governor which I desired Gen  Nicholl s command at Lynchburg to transmit by telegram  About 8 A M  on the 11th intimation was given to me of the advance of the enemy towards the town and at 9 A M  three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills on the north side of the North River  Gen  McCausland having destroyed the bridge over the North River  planted a section of artillery on the Magazine hill  and occupied the adjacent hills south of the river with sharpshooters  Firing soon commenced  and an active artillery fire was kept up for several hours  without loss to our side  By 1 o clock it became evident that the enemy had crossed above Leyburn s mills  and was advancing by Kerr s Creek  I deemed it prudent at once to withdraw and gave orders to Lt  Col  Ship to move by the Fair Grounds road and cross the N  River by the bridge at its mouth  and encamp near Balcony Falls that night  At 2 1 2 P M  Gen  McCausland withdrew with his command   proceeded by the Fancy Hill road towards Buchanan  strongly pressed by the enemy who entered the town at 3 1 2 P M  As guard   protection to the citizens who were moving their servants   stock by the James River  to Bedford and Amherst  I determined to hold the pass at the Balcony Falls  Effective protection was thus given to a large amount of private property  while I was not without the hope that withdrawal of the enemy from Lexington might enable us to return  A raid  however  upon Amherst  and the advance of Averill   pursuit of McCausland into Bedford  made it unsafe to remain above Waugh s Ferry  and Wednesday I gave orders to to retire towards Lynchburg  We met a dispatch on the way from Gen  Breckinridge directing the movement  and at 8 A M  on Thursday the 16th we arrived in Lynchburg  and I immediately reported by telegraph to your office  for the orders of the Governor   Board of Visitors  On Sunday the 12 June all the public buildings of the Institute were burnt by the order of Major General D  Hunter  except my quarters and the quarters of the ordnance Sergeant  The peculiar condition of my daughter  with a child only 48 hours old  induced my wife  Sarah Henderson Smith  to throw herself upon the courtesy of the commanding General  The appeal was not in vain  and I acknowledge with pleasure  this relaxation of the devastation which was unsparingly applied to every species of property owned by the state at the V Mil  Institute  which we were unable to remove  The beautiful statue of Washington cast by Hubard from Houdon s model  was removed  I have brought
