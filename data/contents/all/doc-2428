deHart arrived in Canada last month for the 2014 World Aquathlon Championships   and left with bronze medals around their necks  Both deHarts have been competing in aquathlons  which combine swimming and running  for the past several years  They re now regulars at the world championships  which are sanctioned by the International Triathlon Union  or ITU  which governs both triathlons and aquathlons  The deHarts began as triathlon competitors before switching to aquathlon   Aquathlon is  simple and the training for the cycling leg  of a triathlon  is complicated  said Jenny deHart  staff engineer and sustainability coordinator at VMI s physical plant   It s a very portable sport  Pieter deHart  assistant professor of biology  added   It s a well balanced sport   Aquathlon is relatively even between swimming and running  It really favors the well balanced  Not surprisingly  both husband and wife got an early start with athletics  Jenny deHart has been a swimmer since elementary school and a runner since high school  Her husband competed in his first open water swimming event off the coast of New Jersey at the age of 11 or 12  and made his debut at the aquathlon national championships in 2003  In 2010  the deHarts made their first trip to the aquathlon world championships in Budapest  Hungary  and both earned bronze medals in their age group  The next year  a long plane trip to Beijing  China  for the world championships was rewarded with a silver medal for Pieter deHart and a bronze medal for Jenny deHart  The deHarts didn t compete in 2012  and last year they competed but didn t place in the top three  This year  their persistence and commitment paid off as each finished in third place in their age group at the world championships  which took place Aug  27 in Edmonton  Alberta  Both deHarts also finished as the highest placed Americans in their age group   It s great to be competing against the world s best  said Pieter deHart of this year s finish   We were well prepared  Jenny deHart noted  In readying themselves for the world championships each year  the deHarts face the challenge of finding the time to train while simultaneously fulfilling their obligations at VMI an undertaking that isn t always easy   We have to be very intentional about it  said Pieter deHart of the hunt for workout time  Lunchtime is often a good time to go for a workout  but sometimes meetings get scheduled for that hour  so he s found that having a backup plan is necessary if a lunchtime workout is on his calendar   We try to get in the water four or five times a week  and run the same amount  Pieter deHart noted  Both husband and wife have benefitted from the high intensity interval training workouts offered by VMI s wellness program  and Jenny deHart has also taken the Pilates classes at VMI  With this year s world championships now behind them  the deHarts are now focused on preparation for next year s competition  to be held in Chicago  Ill  Sept  15 20  2015   I think if we can beef up the running portion of our training a bit  this will allow us to break the bronze wall  said Pieter deHart  And when Pieter deHart left this year s world championships  he departed with not only a medal  but something perhaps even more valuable  the beginnings of an international friendship  The silver medalist in his age group was from Brazil  and as the two men were chatting on the podium  Pieter mentioned that he d soon be traveling to that nation while he s on sabbatical from VMI this fall  Immediately  the Brazilian said   I

Championships Pieter and Jenny deHart pause at the podium alongside the first and second place finishers    Photo courtesy of Maj  Jenny deHart  LEXINGTON  Va  Sept  11  2014   Continuing their pattern of athletic accomplishment  Maj  Pieter deHart and Maj  Jenny deHart arrived in Canada last month for the 2014 World Aquathlon Championships   and left with bronze medals around their necks  Both deHarts have been competing in aquathlons  which combine swimming and running  for the past several years  They re now regulars at the world championships  which are sanctioned by the International Triathlon Union  or ITU  which governs both triathlons and aquathlons  The deHarts began as triathlon competitors before switching to aquathlon   Aquathlon is  simple and the training for the cycling leg  of a triathlon  is complicated  said Jenny deHart  staff engineer and sustainability coordinator at VMI s physical plant   It s a very portable sport  Pieter deHart  assistant professor of biology  added   It s a well balanced sport   Aquathlon is relatively even between swimming and running  It really favors the well balanced  Not surprisingly  both husband and wife got an early start with athletics  Jenny deHart has been a swimmer since elementary school and a runner since high school  Her husband competed in his first open water swimming event off the coast of New Jersey at the age of 11 or 12  and made his debut at the aquathlon national championships in 2003  In 2010  the deHarts made their first trip to the aquathlon world championships in Budapest  Hungary  and both earned bronze medals in their age group  The next year  a long plane trip to Beijing  China  for the world championships was rewarded with a silver medal for Pieter deHart and a bronze medal for Jenny deHart  The deHarts didn t compete in 2012  and last year they competed but didn t place in the top three  This year  their persistence and commitment paid off as each finished in third place in their age group at the world championships  which took place Aug  27 in Edmonton  Alberta  Both deHarts also finished as the highest placed Americans in their age group   It s great to be competing against the world s best  said Pieter deHart of this year s finish   We were well prepared  Jenny deHart noted  In readying themselves for the world championships each year  the deHarts face the challenge of finding the time to train while simultaneously fulfilling their obligations at VMI an undertaking that isn t always easy   We have to be very intentional about it  said Pieter deHart of the hunt for workout time  Lunchtime is often a good time to go for a workout  but sometimes meetings get scheduled for that hour  so he s found that having a backup plan is necessary if a lunchtime workout is on his calendar   We try to get in the water four or five times a week  and run the same amount  Pieter deHart noted  Both husband and wife have benefitted from the high intensity interval training workouts offered by VMI s wellness program  and Jenny deHart has also taken the Pilates classes at VMI  With this year s world championships now behind them  the deHarts are now focused on preparation for next year s competition  to be held in Chicago  Ill  Sept  15 20  2015   I think if we can beef up the running portion of our training a bit  this will allow us to break the bronze wall  said Pieter deHart  And when Pieter deHart left this year s world championships  he departed with not only a medal  but something perhaps even more valuable  the beginnings of an international friendship  The silver medalist in his age group was from Brazil  and as the two men were chatting on the podium  Pieter mentioned that he d soon be traveling to that nation while he s on sabbatical from VMI this fall  Immediately  the Brazilian said   I help you  We training  Fortunately  Pieter deHart added  the language barrier shouldn t prove to be a problem   He speaks better English than I do Portuguese   Mary Price    VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos Cindy Bither Administrative Assistant P   540  464 7207
