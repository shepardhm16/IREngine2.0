Class of 1842  The  First Sentinel  Genealogy   Alumni Home John Bowie Strange was born in 1823 in Fluvanna County  Virginia  the son of Gideon Alloway Strange and Harriet J  Magruder When the new Virginia Military Institute opened its doors to cadets on November 11  1839 he was one of the small group who enrolled that first day  He had the additional distinction of serving as the first cadet sentinel assigned to guard duty  replacing the militia that had previously been charged with guarding the stores held in the Lexington Arsenal His classmate Edmund Pendleton  later described the scene   When  on the 11th of November  1839  the youthful band of raw and undisciplined cadets marched to the Institute hill to relieve Captain David E  Moore  who had up to that time guarded the arsenal and other public property there  it fell to the lot of young Strange to be the first to go on post as a sentinel  I doubt if he had ever seen a soldier or held a musket in his callow hands before  The business was as new to his comrades as to himself   and of course he was the object of the careful observation of all  I well remember  as if it were an event of yesterday  how promptly and resolutely he obeyed the first order to duty  how impressed he seemed to be with the dignity of his new position  how erectly he held his musket with bayonet fixed  and how soldier like was his posture  The tradition of guard duty continues to this day  Following his graduation on July 4  1842  Strange pursued a career in education  serving as a teacher  as Principal of Norfolk  VA  Academy  and as Superintendent of the Albemarle  VA  Military Academy  He married Agnes Gaines in the early 1850 s and the couple had four children  Agnes  Henry  VMI Class of 1873  Willoughby  and James  died in
