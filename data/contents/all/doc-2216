Temperature and Time Robert L  McMasters   Department of Mechanical Engineering Virginia Military Institute Ewen C  Todd   National Food Safety and Toxicology Center Michigan State University Introduction Food Safety Objectives  FSOs  are established in order to minimize the risk of foodborne illnesses to consumers  but these have not yet been incorporated into regulatory policy  A FSO states the maximum frequency and  or concentration of a microbiological hazard in a food at the time of consumption that provides an acceptable level of protection to the public and leads to a performance criterion for industry  However  in order to be implemented as a regulation  this criterion has to be achievable by the affected industry  The analysis performed as part of this work used existing models for growth of Listeria monocytogenes in conjunction with calculations of FSOs  to approximate the outcome of more than one introduction of the foodborne organism throughout the food processing path from the farm to the consumer  Calculation of FSO Logarithmic calculation based on single addition of contamination as originally proposed by ICMSF   1  Most models for the growth and reduction of foodborne illnesses are logarithmic in nature  which fits the nature of the growth of microorganisms  spanning many orders of magnitude  However  these logarithmic models are normally limited to a single introduction step and a single reduction step  The model presented as part of this research addresses more than one introduction of food contamination  each of which can be separated by a substantial amount of time  2  The advantage of treating the problem this way is the accommodation of multiple introductions of foodborne pathogens over a range of time durations and conditions  A new non logarithmic calculation based on two additions of contamination is  The logarithmic version of the above equation is    Fundamental Assumptions for Listeria monocytogenes Growth

growth Curves for L  monocytogenes at various temperatures  using the Buchanan and Phillips model  3  with no salt or sodium nitrite content and pH of 7  Figure 2  Growth curves for L  monocytogenes at 6oC with an introduction of 20 cfu g  In the case of the  Single Addition Curve  the introduction took place all at once at time zero  In the case of the  Double Addition Curve  there were 10 cfu g added at time zero and another 10 cfu g added at time 200 hours  The end result is that the FSO  arbitrarily established at 100 CFU  or a logarithmic value of 2  is reached 43 hours earlier in the case of the two step addition  even though the net amount of the addition is the same as in the single step case  Figure 3  A composite of outcomes for various time durations for a second addition of L  monocytogenes in comparison to a single addition  For these examples  the temperature was assumed to be that shown on the horizontal axis throughout the entire process  As in figure 2  the single addition case received one addition of 20 cfu g and the two step addition case received two introductions of L  monocytogenes  of 10 cfu g each  At the colder temperatures  the two step addition cases reach the FSO in a shorter amount of time  At the higher temperatures  the later two step addition cases actually take more time to reach the FSO because each of the two step additions of the bacteria are 1 2 the single addition case and they take benefit of a later kill step  The combination of these factors can actually lead to a longer storage life  Conclusions The time at which the introduction of the contamination takes place is critical in determining whether or not the product meets the FSO  This method accounts for increases in the potential for human illness  possibly stemming from growth of a microorganism introduced subsequent to cooking or processing  e g  by the producer  during transportation  at retail or in the home after the package is opened  followed by a long storage period  In the example of L  monocytogenes in broth culture at 6oC  with an introduction of 20 cfu g  the division of the contamination addition into two steps shortens the storage time 43 hours  from 411 hours to 368  before exceeding the FSO  arbitrarily set at 2 for this example  This method may represent a more realistic model for developing FSOs than the current ICMSF model and needs to be considered for setting policy  Selected References  1  International Commission on Microbiological Specifications for Foods  Microorganisms in Foods 7  Kluwer Academic   Plenum Publishers  New York
