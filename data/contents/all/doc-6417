vulnerability in versions 6 to 11 of Internet Explorer could lead to  the complete compromise  of an affected system  That is the blunt assessment in an advisory released on Monday morning by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team  a part of the Department of Homeland Security known as US CERT  VMI receives frequent alerts from US CERT  but  with the exception of the Heartbleed Bug  few recent threats have been described as so serious  In fact  since about 55  of ALL Windows based systems use some version of Internet Explorer  this threat could be even more widespread and serious than Heartbleed   We are currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem  Carnegie Mellon s Software Engineering Institute warned in a separate advisory that US CERT linked to in its warning  Microsoft s own advisory describes the threat  but also describes the kinds of risky user actions on which so many cyber threats depend  Those user actions  which risk aware users always avoid whatever the threat  are in bold below  Mitigating Factors By default  all supported versions of Microsoft Outlook  Microsoft Outlook Express  and Windows Mail open HTML email messages in the Restricted sites zone  The Restricted sites zone  which disables script and ActiveX controls  helps reduce the risk of an attacker being able to use this vulnerability to execute malicious code  If a user clicks a link in an email message  the user could still be vulnerable to exploitation of this vulnerability through the web based attack scenario  An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user  Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights  In a web based attack scenario  an attacker could host a website that contains a webpage that is used to exploit this vulnerability  In addition  compromised websites and websites that accept or host user provided content or advertisements could contain specially crafted content that could exploit this vulnerability  In all cases  however  an attacker would have no way to force users to visit these websites  Instead  an attacker would have to convince users to visit the website  typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker s website  Once again  a serious threat can be averted by alert users who understand that they are their own first and last lines of defense against cyber threats  The takeaway  Don t cooperate with those who are out to get you  and they WON T get you  If you have any questions  please contact the Help Desk at Help vmi edu or call 7643  VMI Foundation
