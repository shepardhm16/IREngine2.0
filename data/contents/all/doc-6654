by Sherri Tombarge  Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Who s Fighting Whom  Download pdf Tombarge  Southern Nigeria  which is primarily responsible for Nigeria s status as Africa s biggest producer of oil  is far from the center of violence  Nigeria s Muslim north  and Boko Haram  whose leader  I don t dare try to say it  Gire  Abubakar Shekau Tombarge   There you go  has referenced the  glory days of northern Nigeria s medieval Muslim empires   Julia Payne  Reuters  Nigerians face killings  hunger in Boko Haram s  state  Jan  19  2015  He seems to be at war with Nigeria s Muslim center  So what s going on  Who s fighting who and where does this come from  Hentz  There is still conflict in the south  so let me go back to that first  The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram  So why  This doesn t really answer your question  but I think it s really important  The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press  The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative  So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to  When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up  it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got  Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta  The conflict in the Niger Delta  though  is still a serious conflict  and it s still a serious problem  So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously  both   and this is from an academic perspective what I like to look at   both in peripheral areas far from the center  the center being Lagos and Abuja  and in Nigerian politics  the periphery  whether it s the south or the north  have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake  There are a lot of drivers to this conflict   I m sure between James and me we ll come up with a whole bunch   certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources  and it is not equitable  and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it  a place at the table to eat  Gire  It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta  The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control  they ve been ignored for so long  They believe that in the areas are where the bulk of the oil was derived  and if you ve seen oil spills here   what BP was made to go through and so on   there ve been tons of spills across the oil producing areas Hentz  And gas flaring Gire  and gas flares  and it s an environmental disaster  And because of the complacency of the central government and so on  efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate  leaving the people  some of whom are fishermen  unable to engage in very fulfilling day to day sustenance  And so the violence was to bring attention and say   Hey  we re here  and you ve got to take care of these issues that we ve been raving about  And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that  With respect to Boko Haram in the north  it s a little bit different  That is principally  a  religious kind of thing  and that s why it s scary  and that s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention  Because Boko Haram s intentions are to Islamize the whole country  including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south  And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north  guess what their next target is going to be  So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries  As Jim can testify  right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger  in Chad  in Cameroon   these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria  sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth  They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors  They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee  In fact  in the early days of Boko Haram  when they emerged in 2002  they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban  And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country  so that s why other Muslims are not safe  if they re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values  Hentz  The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons  it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear  You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer  Within Nigeria  some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta  although it provides 98 percent of the state s revenues  But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time  While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency   meaning   We want to reform the nature of the state    there s now side by side  maybe a better word would be integrated  with that a warlord conflict  what we call a war economy  And so there are insurgency groups   and there s an alphabet soup list of them   who actually make money off the conflict through in particular bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines  Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors  They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians  So there s many dimensions  There s another element to that conflict  The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden  The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam  but he was also saying that people with western education  which was mostly southerners  are dominating the government  And these southerners that dominate the government  which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated  or Western educated  so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam  it s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government which means they weren t getting the resources they believe they should have  It s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim  it s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country  Gire  Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria  so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country  At the same time  though  the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria  and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria  Ahmadu Bello  is believed to have delayed Nigeria s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready  that if they had given independence at that time  the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners  So there s a vestige of that  What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  I think at the bottom of it all is to control of the powerful economic resources that are available  Hentz  There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict  that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict  in other words it was more about power than it was about religion  And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad  into Cameroon  into Niger  as it is  you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons  So it may be that at the heart of this conflict   I m talking about Boko Haram  it s an Islamic conflict   it s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders  And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya  these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks  These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it s almost impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return  We call this again a war economy  And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram  more so than the Niger Delta  which has been a remarkably self contained conflict   it has not spread really  it s in the Niger Delta  it s spread a little bit in Nigeria  I m talking about across borders  Boko Haram has a different logic  The contagion effect there is much more severe  And I would argue because it s following the 400 year old trading routes in that part of the world  They re not doing anything different than what s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate  They re just adapting what they want to do  their trading networks  their conflicts  to age old Trans Sahel trading routes and alliances  And it s a very fluid situation  Gire  In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria  You probably read this too  Jim  The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers  Hentz  That s another dimension of the conflict  Gire  And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria  They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this  Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of  It s something that s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests  But there s also a broader  more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf  who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau  that s much broader  In fact  the original founder  this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy  the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder  was born in 1927 or something  And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied  And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not  the  prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will  So it dates way back  Hentz  To add to what James said  I think what we re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict  not a Nigerian conflict  And recently the United States is sort of I don t know if the word is celebrating  bragging  happy  that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram  So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface  The Chadian Army  though  is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims  so now you re bringing in another group  of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to  Gen  Idriss  Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims  which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active  Again  from the U S  foreign policy perspective   something that I look at   we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem  We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here  And it s not just northeast Nigeria  It s the Trans Sahel  it s Nigeria  it s the south   it s history  I mean  as James was talking about  you need to go all the way back to the 1920s to understand how this Boko Haram evolved  Gire  That is a very apt analogy  Jim  In fact  in some ways you can draw parallels with what s going on with ISIL in Syria  Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth  Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it  So in at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites  Guess what  It has now morphed out of control  And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened because this stuff has ballooned beyond what the initial expectations were  So this has the potential to be really a wide scale problem if it s not contained  Copyright   2015 Virginia Military Institute  For academic and news media use only  No quotes from

just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries  As Jim can testify  right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger  in Chad  in Cameroon   these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria  sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth  They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors  They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee  In fact  in the early days of Boko Haram  when they emerged in 2002  they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban  And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country  so that s why other Muslims are not safe  if they re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values  Hentz  The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons  it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear  You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer  Within Nigeria  some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta  although it provides 98 percent of the state s revenues  But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time  While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency   meaning   We want to reform the nature of the state    there s now side by side  maybe a better word would be integrated  with that a warlord conflict  what we call a war economy  And so there are insurgency groups   and there s an alphabet soup list of them   who actually make money off the conflict through in particular bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines  Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors  They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians  So there s many dimensions  There s another element to that conflict  The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden  The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam  but he was also saying that people with western education  which was mostly southerners  are dominating the government  And these southerners that dominate the government  which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated  or Western educated  so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam  it s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government which means they weren t getting the resources they believe they should have  It s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim  it s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country  Gire  Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria  so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country  At the same time  though  the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria  and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria  Ahmadu Bello  is believed to have delayed Nigeria s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready  that if they had given independence at that time  the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners  So there s a vestige of that  What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  I think at the bottom of it all is to control of the powerful economic resources that are available  Hentz  There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict  that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict  in other words it was more about power than it was about religion  And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad  into Cameroon  into Niger  as it is  you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons  So it may be that at the heart of this conflict   I m talking about Boko Haram  it s an Islamic conflict   it s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders  And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya  these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks  These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it s almost impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return  We call this again a war economy  And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram  more so than the Niger Delta  which has been a remarkably self contained conflict   it has not spread really  it s in the Niger Delta  it s spread a little bit in Nigeria  I m talking about across borders  Boko Haram has a different logic  The contagion effect there is much more severe  And I would argue because it s following the 400 year old trading routes in that part of the world  They re not doing anything different than what s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate  They re just adapting what they want to do  their trading networks  their conflicts  to age old Trans Sahel trading routes and alliances  And it s a very fluid situation  Gire  In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria  You probably read this too  Jim  The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers  Hentz  That s another dimension of the conflict  Gire  And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria  They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this  Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of  It s something that s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests  But there s also a broader  more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf  who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau  that s much broader  In fact  the original founder  this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy  the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder  was born in 1927 or something  And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied  And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not  the  prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will  So it dates way back  Hentz  To add to what James said  I think what we re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict  not a Nigerian conflict  And recently the United States is sort of I don t know if the word is celebrating  bragging  happy  that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram  So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface  The Chadian Army  though  is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims  so now you re bringing in another group  of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to  Gen  Idriss  Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims  which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active  Again  from the U S  foreign policy perspective   something that I look at   we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem  We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here  And it s not just northeast Nigeria  It s the Trans Sahel  it s Nigeria  it s the south   it s history  I mean  as James was talking about  you need to go all the way back to the 1920s to understand how this Boko Haram evolved  Gire  That is a very apt analogy  Jim  In fact  in some ways you can draw parallels with what s going on with ISIL in Syria  Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth  Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it  So in at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites  Guess what  It has now morphed out of control  And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened because this stuff has ballooned beyond what the initial expectations were  So this has the potential to be really a wide scale

Election Nigeria  A Dialogue Dr  Jim Hentz  Professor International Studies Dr  James Gire  Professor of Psychology Moderated by Sherri Tombarge  Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Who s Fighting Whom  Download pdf Tombarge  Southern Nigeria  which is primarily responsible for Nigeria s status as Africa s biggest producer of oil  is far from the center of violence  Nigeria s Muslim north  and Boko Haram  whose leader  I don t dare try to say it  Gire  Abubakar Shekau Tombarge   There you go  has referenced the  glory days of northern Nigeria s medieval Muslim empires   Julia Payne  Reuters  Nigerians face killings  hunger in Boko Haram s  state  Jan  19  2015  He seems to be at war with Nigeria s Muslim center  So what s going on  Who s fighting who and where does this come from  Hentz  There is still conflict in the south  so let me go back to that first  The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram  So why  This doesn t really answer your question  but I think it s really important  The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press  The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative  So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to  When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up  it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got  Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta  The conflict in the Niger Delta  though  is still a serious conflict  and it s still a serious problem  So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously  both   and this is from an academic perspective what I like to look at   both in peripheral areas far from the center  the center being Lagos and Abuja  and in Nigerian politics  the periphery  whether it s the south or the north  have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake  There are a lot of drivers to this conflict   I m sure between James and me we ll come up with a whole bunch   certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources  and it is not equitable  and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it  a place at the table to eat  Gire  It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta  The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control  they ve been ignored for so long  They believe that in the areas are where the bulk of the oil was derived  and if you ve seen oil spills here   what BP was made to go through and so on   there ve been tons of spills across the oil producing areas Hentz  And gas flaring Gire  and gas flares  and it s an environmental disaster  And because of the complacency of the central government and so on  efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate  leaving the people  some of whom are fishermen  unable to engage in very fulfilling day to day sustenance  And so the violence was to bring attention and say   Hey  we re here  and you ve got to take care of these issues that we ve been raving about  And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that  With respect to Boko Haram in the north  it s a little bit different  That is principally  a  religious kind of thing  and that s why it s scary  and that s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention  Because Boko Haram s intentions are to Islamize the whole country  including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south  And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north  guess what their next target is going to be  So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not

impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return  We call this again a war economy  And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram  more so than the Niger Delta  which has been a remarkably self contained conflict   it has not spread really  it s in the Niger Delta  it s spread a little bit in Nigeria  I m talking about across borders  Boko Haram has a different logic  The contagion effect there is much more severe  And I would argue because it s following the 400 year old trading routes in that part of the world  They re not doing anything different than what s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate  They re just adapting what they want to do  their trading networks  their conflicts  to age old Trans Sahel trading routes and alliances  And it s a very fluid situation  Gire  In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria  You probably read this too  Jim  The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers  Hentz  That s another dimension of the conflict  Gire  And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria  They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this  Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of  It s something that s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests  But there s also a broader  more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf  who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau  that s much broader  In fact  the original founder  this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy  the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder  was born in 1927 or something  And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied  And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not  the  prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will  So it dates way back  Hentz  To add to what James said  I think what we re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict  not a Nigerian conflict  And recently the United States is sort of I don t know if the word is celebrating  bragging  happy  that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram  So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface  The Chadian Army  though  is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims  so now you re bringing in another group  of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to  Gen  Idriss  Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims  which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active  Again  from the U S  foreign policy perspective   something that I look at   we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem  We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here  And it s not just northeast Nigeria  It s the Trans Sahel  it s Nigeria  it s the south   it s history  I mean  as James was talking about  you need to go all the way back to the 1920s to understand how this Boko Haram evolved  Gire  That is a very apt analogy  Jim  In fact  in some ways you can draw parallels with what s going on with ISIL in Syria  Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth  Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it  So in at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites  Guess what  It has now morphed out of control  And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened because this stuff has ballooned beyond what the initial expectations were  So this has the potential to be really a wide scale

Professor International Studies Dr  James Gire  Professor of Psychology Moderated by Sherri Tombarge  Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Who s Fighting Whom  Download pdf Tombarge  Southern Nigeria  which is primarily responsible for Nigeria s status as Africa s biggest producer of oil  is far from the center of violence  Nigeria s Muslim north  and Boko Haram  whose leader  I don t dare try to say it  Gire  Abubakar Shekau Tombarge   There you go  has referenced the  glory days of northern Nigeria s medieval Muslim empires   Julia Payne  Reuters  Nigerians face killings  hunger in Boko Haram s  state  Jan  19  2015  He seems to be at war with Nigeria s Muslim center  So what s going on  Who s fighting who and where does this come from  Hentz  There is still conflict in the south  so let me go back to that first  The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram  So why  This doesn t really answer your question  but I think it s really important  The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press  The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative  So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to  When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up  it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got  Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta  The conflict in the Niger Delta  though  is still a serious conflict  and it s still a serious problem  So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously  both   and this is from an academic perspective what I like to look at   both in peripheral areas far from the center  the center being Lagos and Abuja  and in Nigerian politics  the periphery  whether it s the south or the north  have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake  There are a lot of drivers to this conflict   I m sure between James and me we ll come up with a whole bunch   certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources  and it is not equitable  and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it  a place at the table to eat  Gire  It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta  The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control  they ve been ignored for so long  They believe that in the areas are where the bulk of the oil was derived  and if you ve seen oil spills here   what BP was made to go through and so on   there ve been tons of spills across the oil producing areas Hentz  And gas flaring Gire  and gas flares  and it s an environmental disaster  And because of the complacency of the central government and so on  efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate  leaving the people  some of whom are fishermen  unable to engage in very fulfilling day to day sustenance  And so the violence was to bring attention and say   Hey  we re here  and you ve got to take care of these issues that we ve been raving about  And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that  With respect to Boko Haram in the north  it s a little bit different  That is principally  a  religious kind of thing  and that s why it s scary  and that s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention  Because Boko Haram s intentions are to Islamize the whole country  including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south  And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north  guess what their next target is going to be  So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries  As Jim can testify  right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger  in Chad  in Cameroon   these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria  sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth  They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors  They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee  In fact  in the early days of Boko Haram  when they emerged in 2002  they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban  And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country  so that s why other Muslims are not safe  if they re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values  Hentz  The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons  it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear  You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer  Within Nigeria  some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta  although it provides 98 percent of the state s revenues  But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time  While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency   meaning   We want to reform the nature of the state    there s now side by side  maybe a better word would be integrated  with that a warlord conflict  what we call a war economy  And so there are insurgency groups   and there s an alphabet soup list of them   who actually make money off the conflict through in particular bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines  Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors  They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians  So there s many dimensions  There s another element to that conflict  The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden  The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam  but he was also saying that people with western education  which was mostly southerners  are dominating the government  And these southerners that dominate the government  which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated  or Western educated  so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam  it s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government which means they weren t getting the resources they believe they should have  It s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim  it s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country  Gire  Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria  so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country  At the same time  though  the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria  and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria  Ahmadu Bello  is believed to have delayed Nigeria s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready  that if they had given independence at that time  the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners  So there s a vestige of that  What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  I think at the bottom of it all is to control of the powerful economic resources that are available  Hentz  There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict  that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict  in other words it was more about power than it was about religion  And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad  into Cameroon  into Niger  as it is  you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons  So it may be that at the heart of this conflict   I m talking about Boko Haram  it s an Islamic conflict   it s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders  And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya  these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks  These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it s almost impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in

power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  I think at the bottom of it all is to control of the powerful economic resources that are available  Hentz  There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict  that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict  in other words it was more about power than it was about religion  And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad  into Cameroon  into Niger  as it is  you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons  So it may be that at the heart of this conflict   I m talking about Boko Haram  it s an Islamic conflict   it s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders  And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya  these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks  These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it s almost impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return  We call this again a war economy  And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram  more so than the Niger Delta  which has been a remarkably self contained conflict   it has not spread really  it s in the Niger Delta  it s spread a little bit in Nigeria  I m talking about across borders  Boko Haram has a different logic  The contagion effect there is much more severe  And I would argue because it s following the 400 year old trading routes in that part of the world  They re not doing anything different than what s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate  They re just adapting what they want to do  their trading networks  their conflicts  to age old Trans Sahel trading routes and alliances  And it s a very fluid situation  Gire  In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria  You probably read this too  Jim  The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers  Hentz  That s another dimension of the conflict  Gire  And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria  They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this  Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of  It s something that s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests  But there s also a broader  more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf  who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau  that s much broader  In fact  the original founder  this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy  the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder  was born in 1927 or something  And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied  And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not  the  prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will  So it dates way back  Hentz  To add to what James said  I think what we re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict  not a Nigerian conflict  And recently the United States is sort of I don t know if the word is celebrating  bragging  happy  that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram  So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface  The Chadian Army  though  is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims  so now you re bringing in another group  of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to  Gen  Idriss  Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims  which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active  Again  from the U S  foreign policy perspective   something that I look at   we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem  We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we

which is primarily responsible for Nigeria s status as Africa s biggest producer of oil  is far from the center of violence  Nigeria s Muslim north  and Boko Haram  whose leader  I don t dare try to say it  Gire  Abubakar Shekau Tombarge   There you go  has referenced the  glory days of northern Nigeria s medieval Muslim empires   Julia Payne  Reuters  Nigerians face killings  hunger in Boko Haram s  state  Jan  19  2015  He seems to be at war with Nigeria s Muslim center  So what s going on  Who s fighting who and where does this come from  Hentz  There is still conflict in the south  so let me go back to that first  The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram  So why  This doesn t really answer your question  but I think it s really important  The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press  The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative  So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to  When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up  it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got  Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta  The conflict in the Niger Delta  though  is still a serious conflict  and it s still a serious problem  So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously  both   and this is from an academic perspective what I like to look at   both in peripheral areas far from the center  the center being Lagos and Abuja  and in Nigerian politics  the periphery  whether it s the south or the north  have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake  There are a lot of drivers to this conflict   I m sure between James and me we ll come up with a whole bunch   certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources  and it is not equitable  and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it  a place at the table to eat  Gire  It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta  The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control  they ve been ignored for so long  They believe that in the areas are where the bulk of the oil was derived  and if you ve seen oil spills here   what BP was made to go through and so on   there ve been tons of spills across the oil producing areas Hentz  And gas flaring Gire  and gas flares  and it s an environmental disaster  And because of the complacency of the central government and so on  efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate  leaving the people  some of whom are fishermen  unable to engage in very fulfilling day to day sustenance  And so the violence was to bring attention and say   Hey  we re here  and you ve got to take care of these issues that we ve been raving about  And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that  With respect to Boko Haram in the north  it s a little bit different  That is principally  a  religious kind of thing  and that s why it s scary  and that s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention  Because Boko Haram s intentions are to Islamize the whole country  including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south  And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north  guess what their next target is going to be  So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries  As Jim can testify  right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger  in Chad  in Cameroon   these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria  sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth  They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors  They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee  In fact  in the early days of Boko Haram  when they emerged in 2002  they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban  And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country  so that s why other Muslims are not safe  if they re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values  Hentz  The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons  it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear  You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer  Within Nigeria  some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta  although it provides 98 percent of the state s revenues  But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time  While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency   meaning   We want to reform the nature of the state    there s now side by side  maybe a better word would be integrated  with that a warlord conflict  what we call a war economy  And so there are insurgency groups   and there s an alphabet soup list of them   who actually make money off the conflict through in particular bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines  Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors  They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians  So there s many dimensions  There s another element to that conflict  The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden  The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam  but he was also saying that people with western education  which was mostly southerners  are dominating the government  And these southerners that dominate the government  which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated  or Western educated  so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam  it s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government which means they weren t getting the resources they believe they should have  It s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim  it s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country  Gire  Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria  so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country  At the same time  though  the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria  and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria  Ahmadu Bello  is believed to have delayed Nigeria s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready  that if they had given independence at that time  the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners  So there s a vestige of that  What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  I think at the bottom of it all is to control of the powerful economic resources that are available  Hentz  There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict  that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict
