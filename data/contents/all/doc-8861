farm 150 years ago on this date  May 16  the 257 members of the VMI Corps of Cadets finally had a chance to begin to reflect on the events of the previous 48 hours It is easy to imagine that the cadets were ecstatic with the knowledge that their critical role on the battlefield had assured victory for the Confederate effort  Yet  in those early hours  the cadet corps could not have known that they had created an event unique in American history   never before  nor since  has a college student body participated in pitched combat as an independent unit and achieved victory  Those hours were transformative  The Bushong farm was now a battleground   it would  in time  resume its role as a farm and home for the family who had settled here almost 50 years earlier  but now it also was forever a battlefield  In those 48 hours lives  were changed as well  Two hundred fifty seven college boys were caught up in the swirling experiences of chaos and courage  of exhaustion and exhilaration  of violence and victory  of life and death  Even as they began to untangle their emotions  the reality of the moment demanded their attention  Forty seven wounded Brother Rats   that s what we call classmates   needed medical care  At this hour on May 16  Cadet Moses Ezekiel  the first Jewish cadet at VMI   realized that the grasp on life itself was slipping away from his best friend   Cadet Thomas Jefferson  descendent of the president  In those last hours  Jefferson asked Ezekiel to read to him from the New Testament    In My Father s House there are many mansions    In all  10 cadets   Atwill  Cabell  Crocket  Haynes  Hartsfield  Jones  Jefferson  McDowell  Standard and Wheelright   would die  all young lives of promise  These hours were the defining moments for those who lived  When we examine what became of those cadets who fought here  it is startling to realize the high level of achievement in their life beyond the battlefield and VMI  As great as was their accomplishment on the field of battle  perhaps their greatest triumph is found when they laid aside the dress of the soldier for the attire of the citizen  Cadets with family names of Colonna  Powell  Horsley  Wood  James  Corling and 250 others continue to impact the course of American history  In numbers disproportionate to what statistics would suggest  they became agents of change in the new nation born from civil war  In ways large and small they contributed to society  They pursued careers and  certainly of great importance to all of you here this evening  raised families  Nearly a dozen pursued the arts   including Cadet Moses Ezekiel  whose sculpture Virginia Mourning Her Dead located at VMI marks the graves of six of the New Market casualties  Ezekiel completed this moving allegorical statue just five years after the battle   five years after he held the dying Jefferson in his arms  I submit to you that the creation of this work was an act of healing for Ezekiel  For many cadets  the healing continued through their lives  Two dozen became medical doctors   what correlation can be drawn between the horrors witnessed here on May 15 and the commitment made by those New Market cadets to heal human suffering  Nearly 100 collectively became attorneys  elected public officials and legislators   could their experience here amidst civil war have committed them to careers dedicated to making the post war nation a stronger democracy  Seventeen became educators   teachers and college presidents   lives dedicated to the betterment of society through education  And now  a century and a half later  we gather to recognize their moment here and rededicate ourselves to the standard set for us by their deeds  Former Secretary of the Army Jack Marsh has identified the Battle of New Market as the birthplace of the inimitable Spirit of VMI  This was a proving ground for the VMI citizen soldier  Over the past 15 decades it has become the standard of conduct to which subsequent generations of cadets have been held  Whenever VMI alumni have been called to defend the nation in far off places   a muddy trench in the Somme or a beachhead in Normandy  a rice paddy in Vietnam or a mountaintop in Afghanistan   they do so with the knowledge of the model set by your New Market cadet here  Every year we bring our entering freshman class    rats  as we affectionately call them at VMI   to this place and introduce them to their VMI family heritage  They learn of the courage  determination  and resolve of your New Market cadet  The new cadets stand in Jacob Bushong s orchard  they hear the compelling story of when young people made the difference between victory and defeat  they discover new strength in the bonding with their Brother Rats   the echoes of May 15 touch another generation  just as they have for 150 years  Your family and the VMI family are linked by a moment in time a century and a half past   a moment that continues to change young lives in positive ways  This  in a very real way  is your historical site  We are stakeholders this unique moment  Your presence with us this weekend is a living connection to this heritage  This commemoration is an opportunity for us to rededicate to the telling of the moment in history we share so that the events of your ancestor continue to change the future  It falls to us as stewards of their legacy to assure that future generations of young Americans find inspiration from the story of your New Market cadet  We look forward to welcoming you back often  Thank you   Remarks given by Col  Keith E  Gibson  Director of the

Market Descendents Reception As the sun set over the Bushong farm 150 years ago on this date  May 16  the 257 members of the VMI Corps of Cadets finally had a chance to begin to reflect on the events of the previous 48 hours It is easy to imagine that the cadets were ecstatic with the knowledge that their critical role on the battlefield had assured victory for the Confederate effort  Yet  in those early hours  the cadet corps could not have known that they had created an event unique in American history   never before  nor since  has a college student body participated in pitched combat as an independent unit and achieved victory  Those hours were transformative  The Bushong farm was now a battleground   it would  in time  resume its role as a farm and home for the family who had settled here almost 50 years earlier  but now it also was forever a battlefield  In those 48 hours lives  were changed as well  Two hundred fifty seven college boys were caught up in the swirling experiences of chaos and courage  of exhaustion and exhilaration  of violence and victory  of life and death  Even as they began to untangle their emotions  the reality of the moment demanded their attention  Forty seven wounded Brother Rats   that s what we call classmates   needed medical care  At this hour on May 16  Cadet Moses Ezekiel  the first Jewish cadet at VMI   realized that the grasp on life itself was slipping away from his best friend   Cadet Thomas Jefferson  descendent of the president  In those last hours  Jefferson asked Ezekiel to read to him from the New Testament    In My Father s House there are many mansions    In all  10 cadets   Atwill  Cabell  Crocket  Haynes  Hartsfield  Jones  Jefferson  McDowell  Standard and Wheelright   would die  all young lives of promise  These hours were the defining moments for those who lived  When we examine what became of those cadets who fought here  it is startling to realize the high level of achievement in their life beyond the battlefield and VMI  As great as was their accomplishment on the field of battle  perhaps their greatest triumph is found when they laid aside the dress of the soldier for the attire of the citizen  Cadets with family names of Colonna  Powell  Horsley  Wood  James  Corling and 250 others continue to impact the course of American history  In numbers disproportionate to what statistics would suggest  they became agents of change in the new nation born from civil war  In ways large and small they contributed to society  They pursued careers and  certainly of great importance to all of you here this evening  raised families  Nearly a dozen pursued the arts   including Cadet Moses Ezekiel  whose sculpture Virginia Mourning Her Dead located at VMI marks the graves of six of the New Market casualties  Ezekiel completed this moving allegorical statue just five years after the battle   five years after he held the dying Jefferson in his arms  I submit to you that the creation of this work was an act of healing for Ezekiel  For many cadets  the healing continued through their lives  Two dozen became medical doctors   what correlation can be drawn between the horrors witnessed here on May 15 and the commitment made by those New Market cadets to heal human suffering  Nearly 100 collectively became attorneys  elected public officials and legislators   could their experience here amidst civil war have committed them to careers dedicated to making the post war nation a stronger democracy  Seventeen became educators   teachers and college presidents   lives dedicated to the
