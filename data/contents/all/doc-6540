Public Works Listen to the interview on NPR s  With Good Reason  Maj  Houston Johnson  assistant professor of history  has traveled across the country  delving into archives to research the Depression era public works initiatives that laid the foundations for America s aviation infrastructure  Among the many archives Johnson visited were THE Roosevelt Presidential Library  the Hoover Presidential Library  the National Archives  and the University of Wyoming  Johnson is presenting part of his research at the Organization of American Historians  annual conference April 10 in Atlanta  sharing with fellow historians how New Deal public works programs were vital to establishing municipal airfields in the infancy of commercial aviation  Many airports still in use today trace their roots to airfields set up under New Deal initiatives   They built just under 1 000 airports across the country  including Charlottesville  Roanoke  and a lot of other local fields  said Johnson   Without those federal expenditures  the commercial airline industry would not have been able to provide national service  Johnson found that New Deal projects encouraged long term economic development through construction of not only airports  but also other infrastructure  including roads  dams  and bridges   This goes against the prevailing historical interpretation of New Deal public works  which is that they were make work projects  said Johnson   I m arguing that they provided significant material benefit to the country that had long lasting ramifications  particularly for the airline industry  For that reason we have to re evaluate their significance  Johnson discovered an unbridled excitement and optimism about the potential of aviation within communities where airports were being constructed   On a local level  it s really interesting  said Johnson   15 000 people showed up on a really cold day to see the opening of the Knoxville airport  They had stunt planes  parachute jumpers  and a bunch of speeches  People embraced this with a lot of enthusiasm  The federal government spent hundreds of millions of dollars on airport development  providing improvements that municipalities were not capable of implementing because of the economic situation   By the mid 1930 s  American commercial flying had matured a lot from a technological perspective  said Johnson   Planes like the Douglas DC 3  which were really the first profitable commercial airliners  had retractable landing gear and could carry 16 20 passengers in relative high speed and comfort  Paved runways and passenger terminals were necessary to support the new breed of aircraft being flown by the nation s commercial airlines   That occurs at the very period when the Depression is making it fiscally impossible for localities to spend money on airport development  said Johnson   That s where the federal government comes in  Johnson is looking to publish his research in an academic journal later this year  The research will also form a chapter in a book Johnson is writing on the development of aviation in America from 1918 to 1938   The book looks at how and why the federal government sought to promote the development of commercial aviation in the U S  said Johnson   That includes the origins of the airmail system  which develops into the airlines that we still fly today  By John
