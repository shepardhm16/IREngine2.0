found that  among VMI cadets  asset bubbles formed even when the subjects knew the actual rates of return  and therefore the value  on assets  He presented his findings at the poster session of the Spring URI  Cadet Joseph TaylorDuring the spring of 2009  Colonel Gutermuth worked with Cadet Joe Taylor to implement a sales projection model for a specific firm  Detailed regression models were
