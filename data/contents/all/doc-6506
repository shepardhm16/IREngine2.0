Monday    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Sept  10  2014 Speaking at convocation for the beginning of VMI s 175th academic year Monday  Virginia Lt  Gov  Ralph Northam  81 reminded cadets gathered in Cameron Hall to live lives girded by three timeless components of leadership   service  a strong code of ethics  and honor  In his remarks  Northam drew upon not only his years at VMI  which included serving as honor court president during his 1st Class year  but also his time practicing medicine both in the U S  Army during Operation Desert Storm  and also in private practice  After graduating from high school on Virginia s Eastern Shore  Northam followed his brother  Tom Northam  79  to VMI  That auspicious start was almost aborted  though  when the now lieutenant governor decided midway through his first semester that he d be happier at another college  Over Thanksgiving dinner in 1977  his father scuttled that plan as soon as his younger son had voiced it  After experiencing breakout  in which the 4th Class cadets are officially acknowledged as part of the VMI community  Northam was glad he stayed   This experience here wasn t about me  said Northam of his change of heart at breakout   It was about the Class of 1981   we bonded with each other  As the Class of 1981 became stronger  the Virginia Military Institute became stronger and I became stronger  As the years at VMI passed  and Northam was exposed again and again to the words of Confederate Gen  Thomas J   Stonewall  Jackson   You may be whatever you resolve to be  inscribed over Jackson Arch  Northam decided to dedicate his life to serving others  That life of service has included not only Northam s eight years in the Army  but 16 years as medical director of Edmarc Hospice for Children in Portsmouth  Northam admitted he d had to be talked into taking the job  simply because he found the plight of terminally ill children to be troubling  but now considers it  a tremendous privilege  to support families who are going through the soul wrenching process of losing a child  Northam also served in the state Senate for five years before being elected lieutenant governor   I wanted to make a difference on another level  especially with health care  the Norfolk resident said of his decision to enter the political arena  Northam mentioned passing a ban on smoking in restaurants as among his proudest accomplishments from his years as a state senator  since secondhand smoke has proven to be a major health hazard  Turning his attention to ethics  Northam noted that when he first entered medical practice in the mid 1980s  pharmaceutical company representatives lured doctors to prescribe their company s drugs by offering free trips to the Caribbean and other exotic locales  Now  he noted  physicians don t even take free pens and pencils  The same evolution  he noted  needs to happen in politics  On the subject of honor  Northam said that he was pleased to see that VMI s honor code is the same as it was when he graduated   There s no gray in our honor system  he said   You do not lie  cheat  or steal  or tolerate those who do  Northam did note  though  that the operation of the honor court has changed to make the administration of justice fairer to cadets  Northam explained that when he was a cadet  the honor court itself served as the jury  Now  a jury of cadet peers is chosen   That s a step in the right direction  said Northam  Wrapping up his remarks  Northam reminded the Corps of Cadets of the tremendous opportunities available at the Institute  including a growing array of opportunities that Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  superintendent  enumerated just before Northam spoke  Among those opportunities are vastly increased undergraduate research prospects and new offerings in almost all academic departments   With great fortune comes a lot of responsibility  Northam continued   You don t have to look too far to see that we are living in a very dangerous and complex world  That danger and complexity  though  shouldn t be cause for the young to shrink back  Northam counseled   Aim high  the lieutenant governor told his audience   Do something better than just  living  for yourself  and don t be afraid of falling off the ladder  Get up  dust yourself off  and keep going   Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams

540  464 7443 111 Smith Hall Lexington  VA 24450 Northam Urges Corps to  Aim High  Virginia Lt  Gov  Ralph Northam  81 addresses cadets at convocation Monday    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Sept  10  2014 Speaking at convocation for the beginning of VMI s 175th academic year Monday  Virginia Lt  Gov  Ralph Northam  81 reminded cadets gathered in Cameron Hall to live lives girded by three timeless components of leadership   service  a strong code of ethics  and honor  In his remarks  Northam drew upon not only his years at VMI  which included serving as honor court president during his 1st Class year  but also his time practicing medicine both in the U S  Army during Operation Desert Storm  and also in private practice  After graduating from high school on Virginia s Eastern Shore  Northam followed his brother  Tom Northam  79  to VMI  That auspicious start was almost aborted  though  when the now lieutenant governor decided midway through his first semester that he d be happier at another college  Over Thanksgiving dinner in 1977  his father scuttled that plan as soon as his younger son had voiced it  After experiencing breakout  in which the 4th Class cadets are officially acknowledged as part of the VMI community  Northam was glad he stayed   This experience here wasn t about me  said Northam of his change of heart at breakout   It was about the Class of 1981   we bonded with each other  As the Class of 1981 became stronger  the Virginia Military Institute became stronger and I became stronger  As the years at VMI passed  and Northam was exposed again and again to the words of Confederate Gen  Thomas J   Stonewall  Jackson   You may be whatever you resolve to be  inscribed over Jackson Arch  Northam decided to dedicate his life to serving others  That life of service has included not only Northam s eight years in the Army  but 16 years as medical director of Edmarc Hospice for Children in Portsmouth  Northam admitted he d had to be talked into taking the job  simply because he found the plight of terminally ill children to be troubling  but now considers it  a tremendous privilege  to support families who are going through the soul wrenching process of losing a child  Northam also served in the state Senate for five years before being elected lieutenant governor   I wanted to make a difference on another level  especially with health care  the Norfolk resident said of his decision to enter the political arena  Northam mentioned passing a ban on smoking in restaurants as among his proudest accomplishments from his years as a state senator  since secondhand smoke has proven to be a major health hazard  Turning his attention to ethics  Northam noted that when he first entered medical practice in the mid 1980s  pharmaceutical company representatives lured doctors to prescribe their company s drugs by offering free trips to the Caribbean and other exotic locales  Now  he noted  physicians don t even take free pens and pencils  The same evolution  he noted  needs to happen in politics  On the subject of honor  Northam said that he was pleased to see that VMI s honor code is the same as it was when he graduated   There s no gray in our honor system  he said   You do not lie  cheat  or steal  or tolerate those who do  Northam did note  though  that the operation of the honor court has changed to make the administration of justice fairer to cadets  Northam explained that when he was a cadet  the honor court itself served as the jury  Now  a jury of cadet peers is chosen   That s a step in the right direction  said Northam  Wrapping up his remarks  Northam reminded the Corps of Cadets of the tremendous opportunities available at the Institute  including a growing array of opportunities that Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  superintendent  enumerated just before Northam spoke  Among those opportunities are vastly increased undergraduate research prospects and new offerings in almost all academic departments   With great fortune comes a lot of responsibility  Northam continued   You don t have to look too far to see that we are living in a very dangerous and complex world  That danger and complexity  though  shouldn t be cause for the young to shrink back  Northam counseled   Aim high  the lieutenant governor told his audience   Do something better than just  living  for yourself  and don t be afraid of falling off the ladder  Get up  dust yourself off  and keep going   Mary Price  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos
