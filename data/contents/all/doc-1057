GENERAL J  H  BINFORD PEAY  III SUPERINTENDENT 4 September 2013 Cameron Hall Welcome to this morning s Convocation marking the opening of the 2013 2014 academic year  We are honored to have with us Dr  Jonathan Lyons  today s Convocation speaker  whom I will have the pleasure of introducing to you in a few moments  First  I want to recognize the cadets who are seated to your front  They are Cadets Distinguished in Academic Merit  and I ask you to join me in expressing our congratulations to them on their accomplishments   Applause  Each year at this time we gather to acknowledge and to celebrate the central mission of the Institute  which is to produce educated  informed young men and women who have the knowledge  skills  fitness and character to be useful citizens for all professions  and ready  if qualified  to serve as citizen soldiers  The means by which we seek to accomplish this mission have changed over the course of the Institute s 173 years  but the mission remains the same  We begin this academic year at a time of much discussion as to the relevancy of higher education in the United States  Just one year ago  Newsweek magazine featured a cover story entitled  Is College a Lousy Investment  More recently  William J  Bennett  Secretary of Education under President Reagan  published a book entitled Is college Worth It  in which he asks if colleges have outlived their usefulness   Bennett  by the way  was our commencement speaker in 1987  Other publications  like the New York Review of Books  have asked if colleges are now an endangered species  Surely the mounting cost of higher education  plus the discouraging job prospects of college graduates in the current economy  have fueled such questions  I add  perhaps defensively  that greater than 90  of VMI graduates have jobs at graduation and the Institute is a national leader in that regard  But it appears that there is much more behind the current criticism of a four year  or more  college education  including   to suggest a few reasons   the availability of information at the fingertips of anyone with a  smart phone  or tablet  the availability of online instruction  the reluctance of many colleges to seriously question what undergraduate education should be all about  and even the example of some high profile creative individuals who  as college drop outs  have achieved enormous success and wealth  Today  some young people are asking   Why am I going to college  The situation we face today may affect more individuals than any at any time in our nation s past  but it is not new  The question of whether or not the education our young people receive is  useful    as our speaker today has investigated   has been with us since the early colonial days  Closer in time and closer to home  the question was of intense concern to the founders of VMI  who wanted to produce educated citizens of character for  as they put it   the varied work of civil life  and as Citizen Soldiers  It was no by accident that the Founders called their new creation an  institute  and not a  college  For the first 25 years of the history of VMI  the goal was to produce engineers  agriculturalists  teachers  militia officers  and other professionals who could be described as being  scientific  In the later nineteenth century  the debate in our nation often centered on  useful education  vs  moral education  In my own time  the nation went through extreme soul searching in 1957 when it appeared  because of the Soviet Union s launching of the first satellite  that our colleges and universities had failed to produce the scientists and engineers needed to keep the US ahead in the Cold War  As long as there are colleges and universities in this country  I am certain that  debate  will continue over their proper role and purpose  If the college or university experience were intended only to furnish the mind with  useful  information and prepare an individual for employment  some of the criticisms I have alluded to would probably be valid  Where the goal is simply to train a person for a profession  the task can be achieved in many  and perhaps more efficient  ways than four years in a classroom  There are  for example  many successful machine teaching and online educational programs  some sponsored by traditional colleges and some offered by businesses and industry  There are apprenticeship programs  But we should not abandon the idea that the traditional college or university experience  particularly at the undergraduate level  is broader than professional training or the amassing of information  A college or university is also an academic community  where ideas are developed  discussed  challenged  or defended even in a military structured environment  A college or university is an academic community that permits mental and emotional development of the individual before he or she launches out into the demanding so called  real world  where there is often little time for sustained reflection or intellectual experimentation  A college or university is an academic community where relationships   finding new friends and mentors   are created outside of one s familiar environment  And  a college or a university is  at its center  a world of ideas and learning  Are the years spent at a college or university wasted  Are the costs too high  Are the results open to question  Is the productivity too low  Have colleges and universities failed to do what the world wants done  Or  as Newsweek s cover story asks   Is College a Lousy Investment  The answers to these questions may depend on your perspective  What sort of an investment is it for the nation and society  What sort of an investment is it for the individual  How do you measure the  worth  of a college education  Certainly  there should be transparency and accountability by and for all of us  There is no clear single answer  perhaps there is only the answer of each student who invests four years   or more   of his or her life pursuing a degree  and perhaps there is only the answer that is reflected in what kind of nation and society we are  And since we are a nation of individuals  the former may shape the latter  Unlike some Wall Street investments  where the return is expected in the short term  a college or university education is an investment that often pays dividends  many unexpected  over a lifetime  I believe that is the case at and for VMI  Our speaker today is a journalist and a historian  but above all he is a student of ideas  Jonathan Lyons recently has been studying the history of the American Enlightenment  the subject of his recent book entitled Society for Useful Knowledge  In it he deals with the founders  belief that  the value of knowledge is directly proportional to its utility  and the modern world s loss of notions of wisdom and mystery  He holds a BA in Russian and History from Wesleyan University  and was a Fellow at Columbia University s Harriman Institute of Soviet Studies  He holds the doctorate in sociology and has taught at George Mason University  Georgetown University  and Monash University in Australia  He served as an editor and foreign correspondent for Reuters for more than twenty years  He has been especially interested in the relationship between the Islamic and Western worlds  which led to publication in 2003 of his Answering Only to God  Faith and Freedom in 21st Century Iran  He has also written The House of Wisdom  How the Arabs Transformed Western Civilization  and Islam Through Western Eyes  From the Crusades to the War on Terrorism  Dr  Lyons has said   The state of public discussion  news coverage  and political debate only reinforces his conviction that the

Hall Welcome to this morning s Convocation marking the opening of the 2013 2014 academic year  We are honored to have with us Dr  Jonathan Lyons  today s Convocation speaker  whom I will have the pleasure of introducing to you in a few moments  First  I want to recognize the cadets who are seated to your front  They are Cadets Distinguished in Academic Merit  and I ask you to join me in expressing our congratulations to them on their accomplishments   Applause  Each year at this time we gather to acknowledge and to celebrate the central mission of the Institute  which is to produce educated  informed young men and women who have the knowledge  skills  fitness and character to be useful citizens for all professions  and ready  if qualified  to serve as citizen soldiers  The means by which we seek to accomplish this mission have changed over the course of the Institute s 173 years  but the mission remains the same  We begin this academic year at a time of much discussion as to the relevancy of higher education in the United States  Just one year ago  Newsweek magazine featured a cover story entitled  Is College a Lousy Investment  More recently  William J  Bennett  Secretary of Education under President Reagan  published a book entitled Is college Worth It  in which he asks if colleges have outlived their usefulness   Bennett  by the way  was our commencement speaker in 1987  Other publications  like the New York Review of Books  have asked if colleges are now an endangered species  Surely the mounting cost of higher education  plus the discouraging job prospects of college graduates in the current economy  have fueled such questions  I add  perhaps defensively  that greater than 90  of VMI graduates have jobs at graduation and the Institute is a national leader in that regard  But it appears that there is much more behind the current criticism of a four year  or more  college education  including   to suggest a few reasons   the availability of information at the fingertips of anyone with a  smart phone  or tablet  the availability of online instruction  the reluctance of many colleges to seriously question what undergraduate education should be all about  and even the example of some high profile creative individuals who  as college drop outs  have achieved enormous success and wealth  Today  some young people are asking   Why am I going to college  The situation we face today may affect more individuals than any at any time in our nation s past  but it is not new  The question of whether or not the education our young people receive is  useful    as our speaker today has investigated   has been with us since the early colonial days  Closer in time and closer to home  the question was of intense concern to the founders of VMI  who wanted to produce educated citizens of character for  as they put it   the varied work of civil life  and as Citizen Soldiers  It was no by accident that the Founders called their new creation an  institute  and not a  college  For the first 25 years of the history of VMI  the goal was to produce engineers  agriculturalists  teachers  militia officers  and other professionals who could be described as being  scientific  In the later nineteenth century  the debate in our nation often centered on  useful education  vs  moral education  In my own time  the nation went through extreme soul searching in 1957 when it appeared  because of the Soviet Union s launching of the first satellite  that our colleges and universities had failed to produce the scientists and engineers needed to keep the US ahead in the Cold War  As long as there are colleges and universities in this country  I am certain that  debate  will continue over their proper role and purpose  If the college or university experience were intended only to furnish the mind with  useful  information and prepare an individual for employment  some of the criticisms I have alluded to would probably be valid  Where the goal is simply to train a person for a profession  the task can be achieved in many  and perhaps more efficient  ways than four years in a classroom  There are  for example  many successful machine teaching and online educational programs  some sponsored by traditional colleges and some offered by businesses and industry  There are apprenticeship programs  But we should not abandon the idea that the traditional college or university experience  particularly at the undergraduate level  is broader than professional training or the amassing of information  A college or university is also an academic community  where ideas are developed  discussed  challenged  or defended even in a military structured environment  A college or university is an academic community that permits mental and emotional development of the individual before he or she launches out into the demanding so called  real world  where there is often little time for sustained reflection or intellectual experimentation  A college or university is an academic community where relationships   finding new friends and mentors   are created outside of one s familiar environment  And  a college or a university is  at its center  a world of ideas and learning  Are the years spent at a college or university wasted  Are the costs too high  Are the results open to question  Is the productivity too low  Have colleges and universities failed to do what the world wants done  Or  as Newsweek s cover story asks   Is College a Lousy Investment  The answers to these questions may depend on your perspective  What sort of an investment is it for the nation and society  What sort of an investment is it for the individual  How do you measure the  worth  of a college education  Certainly  there should be transparency and accountability by and for all of us  There is no clear single answer  perhaps there is only the answer of each student who invests four years   or more   of his or her life pursuing a degree  and perhaps there is only the answer that is reflected in what kind of nation and society we are  And since we are a nation of individuals  the former may shape the latter  Unlike some Wall Street investments  where the return is expected in the short term  a college or university education is an investment that often pays dividends  many unexpected  over a lifetime  I believe that is the case at and for VMI  Our speaker today is a journalist and a historian  but above all he is a student of ideas  Jonathan Lyons recently has been studying the history of the American Enlightenment  the subject of his recent book entitled Society for Useful Knowledge  In it he deals with the founders  belief that  the value of knowledge is directly proportional to its utility  and the modern world s loss of notions of wisdom and mystery  He holds a BA in Russian and History from Wesleyan University  and was a Fellow at Columbia University s Harriman Institute of Soviet Studies  He holds the doctorate in sociology and has taught at George Mason University  Georgetown University  and Monash University in Australia  He served as an editor and foreign correspondent for Reuters

III SUPERINTENDENT 4 September 2013 Cameron Hall Welcome to this morning s Convocation marking the opening of the 2013 2014 academic year  We are honored to have with us Dr  Jonathan Lyons  today s Convocation speaker  whom I will have the pleasure of introducing to you in a few moments  First  I want to recognize the cadets who are seated to your front  They are Cadets Distinguished in Academic Merit  and I ask you to join me in expressing our congratulations to them on their accomplishments   Applause  Each year at this time we gather to acknowledge and to celebrate the central mission of the Institute  which is to produce educated  informed young men and women who have the knowledge  skills  fitness and character to be useful citizens for all professions  and ready  if qualified  to serve as citizen soldiers  The means by which we seek to accomplish this mission have changed over the course of the Institute s 173 years  but the mission remains the same  We begin this academic year at a time of much discussion as to the relevancy of higher education in the United States  Just one year ago  Newsweek magazine featured a cover story entitled  Is College a Lousy Investment  More recently  William J  Bennett  Secretary of Education under President Reagan  published a book entitled Is college Worth It  in which he asks if colleges have outlived their usefulness   Bennett  by the way  was our commencement speaker in 1987  Other publications  like the New York Review of Books  have asked if colleges are now an endangered species  Surely the mounting cost of higher education  plus the discouraging job prospects of college graduates in the current economy  have fueled such questions  I add  perhaps defensively  that greater than 90  of VMI graduates have jobs at graduation and the Institute is a national leader in that regard  But it appears that there is much more behind the current criticism of a four year  or more  college education  including   to suggest a few reasons   the availability of information at the fingertips of anyone with a  smart phone  or tablet  the availability of online instruction  the reluctance of many colleges to seriously question what undergraduate education should be all about  and even the example of some high profile creative individuals who  as college drop outs  have achieved enormous success and wealth  Today  some young people are asking   Why am I going to college  The situation we face today may affect more individuals than any at any time in our nation s past  but it is not new  The question of whether or not the education our young people receive is  useful    as our speaker today has investigated   has been with us since the early colonial days  Closer in time and closer to home  the question was of intense concern to the founders of VMI  who wanted to produce educated citizens of character for  as they put it   the varied work of civil life  and as Citizen Soldiers  It was no by accident that the Founders called their new creation an  institute  and not a  college  For the first 25 years of the history of VMI  the goal was to produce engineers  agriculturalists  teachers  militia officers  and other professionals who could be described as being  scientific  In the later nineteenth century  the debate in our nation often centered on  useful education  vs  moral education  In my own time  the nation went through extreme soul searching in 1957 when it appeared  because of the Soviet Union s launching of the first satellite  that our colleges and universities had failed to produce the scientists and engineers needed to keep the US ahead in the Cold War  As long as there are colleges and universities in this country  I am certain that  debate  will continue over their proper role and purpose  If the college or university experience were intended only to furnish the mind with  useful  information and prepare an individual for employment  some of the criticisms I have alluded to would probably be valid  Where the goal is simply to train a person for a profession  the task can be achieved in many  and perhaps more efficient  ways than four years in a classroom  There are  for example  many successful machine teaching and online educational programs  some sponsored by traditional colleges and some offered by businesses and industry  There are apprenticeship programs  But we should not abandon the idea that the traditional college or university experience  particularly at the undergraduate level  is broader than professional training or the amassing of information  A college or university is also an academic community  where ideas are developed  discussed  challenged  or defended even in a military structured environment  A college or university is an academic community that permits mental and emotional development of the individual before he or she launches out into the demanding so called  real world  where there is often little time for sustained reflection or intellectual experimentation  A college or university is an academic community where relationships   finding new friends and mentors   are created outside of one s familiar environment  And  a college or a university is  at its center  a world of ideas and learning  Are the years spent at a college or university wasted  Are the costs too high  Are the results open to question  Is the productivity too low  Have colleges and universities failed to do what the world wants done  Or  as Newsweek s cover story asks   Is College a Lousy Investment  The answers to these questions may depend on your perspective  What sort of an investment is it for the nation and society  What sort of an investment is it for the individual  How do you measure the  worth  of a college education  Certainly  there should be transparency and accountability by and for all of us  There is no clear single answer  perhaps there is only the answer of each student who invests four years   or more   of his or her life pursuing a degree  and perhaps there is only the answer that is reflected in what kind of nation and society we are  And since we are a nation of individuals  the former may shape the latter  Unlike some Wall Street investments  where the return is expected in the short term  a college or university education is an investment that often pays dividends  many unexpected  over a lifetime  I believe that is the case at and for VMI  Our speaker today is a journalist and a historian  but above all he is a student of ideas  Jonathan Lyons recently has been studying the history of the American Enlightenment  the subject of his recent book entitled Society for Useful Knowledge  In it he deals with the founders  belief that  the value of knowledge is directly proportional to its utility  and the modern world s loss of notions of wisdom and mystery  He holds a BA in Russian and History from Wesleyan University  and was a Fellow at Columbia University s Harriman Institute of Soviet Studies  He holds the doctorate in sociology and has taught at George Mason University  Georgetown University  and Monash University in Australia  He served as an editor and foreign correspondent for Reuters for more than twenty years  He has been especially interested in the relationship between the Islamic and Western worlds  which led to publication in 2003 of his Answering Only to God  Faith and Freedom in 21st Century Iran  He has also written The House of Wisdom  How the Arabs Transformed Western Civilization  and Islam Through Western Eyes  From the Crusades to the
