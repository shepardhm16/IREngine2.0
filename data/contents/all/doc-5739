Education Resource Center  is helping cadets excel in their mathematics coursework and nurturing an appreciation for mathematics across the region  This semester the MERC began offering open math labs  which provide the opportunity for cadets to study with access to a tutor Monday through Friday from 6 to 11 p m  The open lab model allows cadets to get the help they need when they need it   They don t have to make appointments  They don t have to show up with an agenda and perform like with a one to one tutoring system  said Maj  Randy Cone  associate professor of mathematics and computer science   They just show up with questions about their homework or their course material and they get help at will   I ve had cadets tell me that they appreciate having a place to come and get an answer  said Ruth Ann Hildreth  a math lab tutor   It s really helpful for them to be here and work at their own pace  Cadets are finding the labs valuable and seeing the lab time pay off in their coursework   Having the availability five hours a night is incredible  said Cadet Keith MacDonald  14   Here I can come in every night from 6 to 11 and there s help if I need it  Allowing cadets to work at their own pace and giving them a chance to figure out as much as they can on their own instills valuable skills   What we re trying to do is to encourage cadets to be independent learners  said Cone   The next step beyond that  the ultimate goal  is to teach cadets to be independent thinkers  The MERC had planned to open in the fall 2012 semester  but since there were so many cadets who could benefit  the center began offering services in January   For now we re serving seven courses  We re going to expand that when we come into our full opening next year  said Cone  The current seven courses are 100 level courses  The plan is to bring the total to 12 next semester  including courses in 200 and 300 levels  The MERC is also implementing an online resource through the Mathematical Association of America called WeBWorK that will offer the opportunity to practice mathematical skills  WeBWorK is open source software that offers cadets a library of 20 000 homework problems and is already being used for some math courses  In addition to serving the needs of cadets  the MERC is serving the community by becoming a regional hub for mathematical studies   What we would like to do is to create and foster a level of excitement about mathematics and science in general  and we would like to do that at all levels  said Cone   We can do this at the middle school level  we can do this at the high school level  and we can do this in our classrooms and labs  On Feb  22  53 students from area high schools competed in the 10th and 12th grade American Mathematics Competition  held at VMI  a test which challenges students with mathematical questions   We had a whole bunch of kids come here  and it was so much fun  said Cone   They got really excited about VMI  and they got really excited about participating in this big deal of a test when they wouldn t normally have had the opportunity  VMI s MERC is filling a void in the region   People in the region are really starving for genuine mathematical and scientific challenges  so it s a great way to serve our community  said Cone   Not only does that help us as an institute  but it helps the community as well  By bringing local students and cadets into contact with those challenges and appreciating the mathematics behind them  the MERC is helping them see math in a new light   This is about seeing that it s more than just numbers  said Cone   It s actually a bunch of interesting and beautiful ideas  That s what it really is  That s what mathematics can be  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni

Offers Open Math Lab Institute Report  March 2012 A new institution at VMI  the Mathematics Education Resource Center  is helping cadets excel in their mathematics coursework and nurturing an appreciation for mathematics across the region  This semester the MERC began offering open math labs  which provide the opportunity for cadets to study with access to a tutor Monday through Friday from 6 to 11 p m  The open lab model allows cadets to get the help they need when they need it   They don t have to make appointments  They don t have to show up with an agenda and perform like with a one to one tutoring system  said Maj  Randy Cone  associate professor of mathematics and computer science   They just show up with questions about their homework or their course material and they get help at will   I ve had cadets tell me that they appreciate having a place to come and get an answer  said Ruth Ann Hildreth  a math lab tutor   It s really helpful for them to be here and work at their own pace  Cadets are finding the labs valuable and seeing the lab time pay off in their coursework   Having the availability five hours a night is incredible  said Cadet Keith MacDonald  14   Here I can come in every night from 6 to 11 and there s help if I need it  Allowing cadets to work at their own pace and giving them a chance to figure out as much as they can on their own instills valuable skills   What we re trying to do is to encourage cadets to be independent learners  said Cone   The next step beyond that  the ultimate goal  is to teach cadets to be independent thinkers  The MERC had planned to open in the fall 2012 semester  but since there were so many cadets who could benefit  the center began offering services in January   For now we re serving seven courses  We re going to expand that when we come into our full opening next year  said Cone  The current seven courses are 100 level courses  The plan is to bring the total to 12 next semester  including courses in 200 and 300 levels  The MERC is also implementing an online resource through the Mathematical Association of America called WeBWorK that will offer the opportunity to practice mathematical skills  WeBWorK is open source software that offers cadets a library of 20 000 homework problems and is already being used for some math courses  In addition to serving the needs of cadets  the MERC is serving the community by becoming a regional hub for mathematical studies   What we would like to do is to create and foster a level of excitement about mathematics and science in general  and we would like to do that at all levels  said Cone   We can do this at the middle school level  we can do this at the high school level  and we can do this in our classrooms and labs  On Feb  22  53 students from area high schools competed in the 10th and 12th grade American Mathematics Competition  held at VMI  a test which challenges students with mathematical questions   We had a whole bunch of kids come here  and it was so much fun  said Cone   They got really excited about VMI  and they got really excited about participating in this big deal of a test when they wouldn t normally have had the opportunity  VMI s MERC is filling a void in the region   People in the region are really starving for genuine mathematical and scientific challenges  so it s a great way to serve our community  said Cone   Not only does that help us as an institute  but it helps the community as well  By bringing local students and cadets into contact with those challenges and appreciating the mathematics behind them  the MERC is helping them see math in a new light   This is about seeing that it s more than just numbers  said Cone   It s actually a bunch of interesting and beautiful ideas  That s what it really is  That s what mathematics can be Academics Home Jackson Hope Fund Video Testimonies Jackson Hope Stories Initiatives Funding Process About the Fund History Membership Jackson
