International Perspective to ECBU It s clich  to say that it s a small world after all   but in VMI s Department of Economics and Business  the shrinking world is a reality that s affecting the curriculum  Starting this fall  economics and business majors will have the opportunity to sign up for a concentration in global management  The new concentration was approved last spring by VMI s Academic Board  To earn the global management concentration  cadets must choose four out of six electives  International Business  International Marketing  International Finance  International Trade  Developmental Economics  and Institutions and Economic Development  Study abroad may be substituted for one of those courses  There are also five international studies courses that may be substituted for one of the ECBU courses  with the department head s approval  The global management concentration was conceived as a way to align the curriculum with the needs of today s business world  said Lt  Col  Ray MacDermott  associate professor of economics and business and one of the chief architects of the new concentration   In putting together the concentration  we were trying to achieve two goals  he said   The first was to allow or even encourage cadets to focus their economics and business electives on global management  Second  the concentration serves as a signal to future employers of this preparation  The need to strengthen VMI s offerings in the area of global economics was first pointed out by the department s accrediting agency  the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International  during a visit in the 2009 10 school year  explained Col  Bob Moreschi  professor of economics and business and now department head  At that point  Moreschi noted  the only internationally oriented classes the department offered were international finance and international economics   We were kind of light on international courses  he acknowledged  Moreschi explained that the need to offer more internationally focused courses has had an effect on hiring within the department over the past few years   In hiring  we want the best candidate  he said   But with all other things being equal  we want the best candidate interested in teaching electives with a foreign bent  Now  five out of the 13 professors in the department were born overseas   There s some natural interest in overseas courses from foreign born faculty  he noted  In keeping with this  Bulgarian born Maj  Valentina Dimitrova Grajzl is teaching Institutions and Economic Development  while Col  Tinni Sen  a native of India  is teaching International Finance  One cadet who s decided to undertake the global management concentration sees a clear path between the courses it offers and the future he s planned   After VMI  I hope to work with an international marketing firm  said Hunter Linton  15   So I feel this concentration will give me a good basis for global awareness upon entering into that field  Building such global awareness is the main goal of offering the new concentration  said Dimitrova Grajzl   Anyone in any profession would benefit from taking this concentration  she said   We re connected through the Internet and we re connected financially with the rest of the world  The other concentration offered within the ECBU Department is financial management  Moreschi said that concentration  which typically attracts 10 to 20 cadets per class  was already in place when he arrived at VMI in 2002  By   Mary Price IR   Oct  2013 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
