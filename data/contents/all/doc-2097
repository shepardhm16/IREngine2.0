Foundation decided that a new approach was needed to managing the VMI Endowment  That year  VMI Investment Holdings LLC was established and charged with finding a management firm that would actively manage the Endowment  After a lengthy and intensive search process  VMI Investment Holdings LLC contracted with the nationally recognized investment management firm Cliffwater LLC for the task  With an eye toward long term protection of the Endowment against possible future market volatility  VMI Investment Holdings LLC directed a change in asset allocation within the VMI Endowment  Previously weighted heavily toward equities and bonds  the new allocation entailed more fixed income and fixed income associated investments as well as what are termed  defensive alternative investments

Since 2004  the VMI Endowment has provided more than  100 million in support to the Institute  The level of support has been kept relatively high  the distribution rate has been 4 8  because of the need of the Institute for increased private support at a time when state support was decreasing  In the future  however  it is hoped that a sound  long term investment strategy will generate more
