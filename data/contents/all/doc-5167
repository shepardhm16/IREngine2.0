want her only interaction with students to occur within 50 minute blocks  Dimitrova Grajzl  who is assistant professor of economics and business  makes it her goal to get to know cadets both inside and outside the classroom  To that end  she coordinated a Habitat for Humanity building project that brought together female cadets  faculty  and staff  with the goal of building both relationships and houses  Dimitrova Grajzl grew up in Bulgaria  while that nation was still part of the Soviet bloc  and earned her bachelor s degree at Wittenberg University in Springfield  Ohio   Bulgaria was too small for me  she says of her desire to study abroad  She later earned a doctorate at the University of Maryland at College Park  with her doctoral work focusing on post socialist economies  She has taught at VMI since the fall of 2011  Dimitrova Grajzl believes that VMI s academic structure fosters a close relationship between cadets and faculty  as cadets are assigned an academic adviser immediately upon arriving at VMI  Because of this  students and faculty start getting to know each other sooner than they might elsewhere  Dimitrova Grajzl enjoys teaching the kind of students who come to VMI   Cadets  honesty and willingness to accept critique are very refreshing  she notes  Women Build Gallery  Habitat fits very nicely with the mission of VMI  which is to have leaders  but you also want to have people who have compassion and understand other people s positions   who they are and why they are where they are  It gives empathy  it gives leadership  and it gives some
