General J H  Binford Peay  III Superintendent November 11  2014 Ladies and gentlemen  members of the Institute Society and guests  I also welcome you to this annual gala gathering of friends and supporters of the Institute  This year is especially notable in the life of VMI  for not only is it the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Institute Society  but it marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  and the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  Earlier today  at the Founders Day Convocation  we celebrated that anniversary and welcomed Virginia s 72nd Governor  the Honorable Terry McAuliffe  who spoke to the VMI community gathered in Cameron Hall and to no surprise he declared amnesty for the Corps of Cadets  We followed that with the  Corps on Parade  How can any of us not be proud and stand tall watching the future of America pass by  it certainly gives me strength and great confidence in the Institute s and our nation s future  In my welcoming celebration convocation remarks this morning  I mentioned that the Institute was officially created two years before it actually began operations on 11 November 1839  The opening of the Institute had to be  postponed  because of the economic panic of that year   America s first depression   a financial downturn that strongly resembled what this nation has just endured  Undeterred  the Virginia General Assembly and the Institute s Founders   members of our first Board of Visitors along with Smith  Crozet  and Preston   did not give in or give up  but persevered and succeeded  And the Institute has lived on  through many other financial crises  the Civil War  the Great Depression of the 1930s  two World Wars  and other difficult times  Looking back over these eventful years and remarkable generations  we can truly say  that the Institute has had a glorious past and I think in the years ahead a brilliant future  for  VMI is truly a national treasure  For over a century and a half  VMI has provided leaders in science and engineering  education  the law  business  medicine  and the military   The Institute has fulfilled  an uncommon purpose  VMI fosters in its graduates values and capabilities for an expanding and extraordinarily complex world  Today  as we look at the Institute  we see a splendid academic program  a robust building plan to accommodate today s needs and tomorrow s opportunities   an athletic program that develops leaders   true student athletes with integrity  and a strong  vibrant  disciplined  and honorable Corps of Cadets  Like conditions at the founding of the Institute  however  economic reality presses hard on VMI  Declining state revenues have forced budget reductions  equally  in all the state colleges and universities across the Commonwealth  VMI s reductions have perhaps been felt greater than the average due mainly to its small size  compounded by VMI s significant growth in in state enrollment  thereby limiting higher paying out of state numbers   The growth in Virginia cadets ideally would have been accompanied by an increase in State general funds  but the State has lagged behind because of the two recessions which have occurred during the past decade    The situation is troubling  and there is  in my view after 12 years of working the halls of the Virginia legislature along with corporate business leaders who are equally concerned with an educated workforce for top jobs  little hope that things will  quickly  get better  Our state elected VMI friends have been incredibly helpful  particularly as regards construction resources  The lesson we have learned is that VMI cannot depend on State support in operational dollars for higher education  principally because of the decline in State revenues tied to reduced defense spending impacting Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads   Norfolk areas  We must not continue to increase the cost of a VMI education for cadets and their families  It is not in our tradition  nor favorable to the kinds of young men and women we want to enter Jackson Arch as our future graduates  Understanding the decade long record of State budget reductions  we   the Institute   need to be in the position that insures every qualified cadet that we accept to VMI  should receive some form of need based financial support or other merit scholarship tuition assistance  This is among the priorities of the new VMI Campaign  a  comprehensive campaign which focuses on significant support for  academics  Corps life  athletics  preserving the Institute s growing historical activities  and  importantly  unrestricted  annual and endowment support  These combinations will provide a  value based  education  the very best in America  There will be numerous campaigns at VMI before the Institute reaches its 200th birthday in 2039  We should set  stretch  and achieve a VMI Foundation endowment goal in 2039 of  2 0 billion dollars as we celebrate that Founders Day event  We can do that  We must do that  This campaign announcement this evening is a  wonderful first step  along that path that ensures our destiny and supports that 2039 goal  We are justifiably proud of the Institute s academic program and its talented faculty  We have limited degrees and they are all challenging  Greater than 50 percent of the Corps major in math  science  or engineering  All of our full time faculty hold the Ph D  degree  and all of our faculty teach  We have small classes and an excellent ratio of one faculty member to 12 cadets  We have partnerships with the best graduate schools in the nation  we are nationally ranked and have excellent high tech classrooms and facilities  Our cadet athletes are student athletes  setting a standard for America  One result  of many  is that 98 percent of our cadets annually have jobs at graduation  an unheard achievement in these economic times  All of this and more makes VMI distinctive and highly successful   And all of this comes with high costs that increase with each year   Excellence costs  But  the return on the investment is more than justified  as the splendid record of our alumni abundantly testifies leaders of the Commonwealth and our nation disproportionate to any in the nation  VMI graduates are trusted  Unfailing  They hone their sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust athletic program  The VMI experience prepares them for the life ahead  a life of strength  honor  and integrity  The VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  and perseverance   is the common bond of these true citizen soldiers who  in the military or as civilians  serve the nation in times of peace and of deepest peril  In the coming weeks and months  you will hear a lot about this VMI Campaign  and I believe you will be proud of what we will announce this evening  It is truly a team effort and I commend the staffs and volunteers of the VMI Foundation  the Keydet Club  the Alumni Association  our Parents Council  and the Campaign Cabinet for their dedication to the campaign s success  I express my heartfelt appreciation to all of our donors  past and present  who have made possible so much that has allowed VMI to thrive through its long history  And  I express my special thanks to all of you gathered here tonight  The Institute Society has made an enormous difference in the life of VMI  not only through your generosity  but your commitment to the mission of the Institute and your faith in its brilliant future  It is my pleasure  as we launch our next campaign  to introduce the gentleman who leads this important fund raising effort  Mr  Donald M  Wilkinson  Jr   He is a graduate of the Institute and a graduate of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia  He served as an officer in the U S  Army during the Cold War  and then founded Wilkinson O Grady  a New York based global investment management firm where he is Chairman and Chief Investment Officer today  He has given more than three decades of service to VMI  beginning with his volunteer work with VMI s

capabilities for an expanding and extraordinarily complex world  Today  as we look at the Institute  we see a splendid academic program  a robust building plan to accommodate today s needs and tomorrow s opportunities   an athletic program that develops leaders   true student athletes with integrity  and a strong  vibrant  disciplined  and honorable Corps of Cadets  Like conditions at the founding of the Institute  however  economic reality presses hard on VMI  Declining state revenues have forced budget reductions  equally  in all the state colleges and universities across the Commonwealth  VMI s reductions have perhaps been felt greater than the average due mainly to its small size  compounded by VMI s significant growth in in state enrollment  thereby limiting higher paying out of state numbers   The growth in Virginia cadets ideally would have been accompanied by an increase in State general funds  but the State has lagged behind because of the two recessions which have occurred during the past decade    The situation is troubling  and there is  in my view after 12 years of working the halls of the Virginia legislature along with corporate business leaders who are equally concerned with an educated workforce for top jobs  little hope that things will  quickly  get better  Our state elected VMI friends have been incredibly helpful  particularly as regards construction resources  The lesson we have learned is that VMI cannot depend on State support in operational dollars for higher education  principally because of the decline in State revenues tied to reduced defense spending impacting Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads   Norfolk areas  We must not continue to increase the cost of a VMI education for cadets and their families  It is not in our tradition  nor favorable to the kinds of young men and women we want to enter Jackson Arch as our future graduates  Understanding the decade long record of State budget reductions  we   the Institute   need to be in the position that insures every qualified cadet that we accept to VMI  should receive some form of need based financial support or other merit scholarship tuition assistance  This is among the priorities of the new VMI Campaign  a  comprehensive campaign which focuses on significant support for  academics  Corps life  athletics  preserving the Institute s growing historical activities  and  importantly  unrestricted  annual and endowment support  These combinations will provide a  value based  education  the very best in America  There will be numerous campaigns at VMI before the Institute reaches its 200th birthday in 2039  We should set  stretch  and achieve a VMI Foundation endowment goal in 2039 of  2 0 billion dollars as we celebrate that Founders Day event  We can do that  We must do that  This campaign announcement this evening is a  wonderful first step  along that path that ensures our destiny and supports that 2039 goal  We are justifiably proud of the Institute s academic program and its talented faculty  We have limited degrees and they are all challenging  Greater than 50 percent of the Corps major in math  science  or engineering  All of our full time faculty hold the Ph D  degree  and all of our faculty teach  We have small classes and an excellent ratio of one faculty member to 12 cadets  We have partnerships with the best graduate schools in the nation  we are nationally ranked and have excellent high tech classrooms and facilities  Our cadet athletes are student athletes  setting a standard for America  One result  of many  is that 98 percent of our cadets annually have jobs at graduation  an unheard achievement in these economic times  All of this and more makes VMI distinctive and highly successful   And all of this comes with high costs that increase with each year   Excellence costs  But  the return on the investment is more than justified  as the splendid record of our alumni abundantly testifies leaders of the Commonwealth and our nation disproportionate to any in the nation  VMI graduates are trusted  Unfailing  They hone their sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust athletic program  The VMI experience prepares them for the life ahead  a life of strength  honor  and integrity  The VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  and perseverance   is the common bond of these true citizen soldiers who  in the military or as civilians  serve the nation in times of peace and of deepest peril  In the coming weeks and months  you will hear a lot about this VMI Campaign  and I believe you will be proud of what we will announce this evening  It is truly a team effort and I commend the staffs and volunteers of the VMI Foundation  the Keydet Club  the Alumni Association  our Parents Council  and the Campaign Cabinet for their dedication to the campaign s success  I express my heartfelt appreciation to all of our donors  past and present  who have made possible so much that has allowed VMI to thrive through its long history  And  I express my special thanks to all of you gathered here tonight  The Institute Society has

also welcome you to this annual gala gathering of friends and supporters of the Institute  This year is especially notable in the life of VMI  for not only is it the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Institute Society  but it marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  and the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  Earlier today  at the Founders Day Convocation  we celebrated that anniversary and welcomed Virginia s 72nd Governor  the Honorable Terry McAuliffe  who spoke to the VMI community gathered in Cameron Hall and to no surprise he declared amnesty for the Corps of Cadets  We followed that with the  Corps on Parade  How can any of us not be proud and stand tall watching the future of America pass by  it certainly gives me strength and great confidence in the Institute s and our nation s future  In my welcoming celebration convocation remarks this morning  I mentioned that the Institute was officially created two years before it actually began

resembled what this nation has just endured  Undeterred  the Virginia General Assembly and the Institute s Founders   members of our first Board of Visitors along with Smith  Crozet  and Preston   did

welcome you to this annual gala gathering of friends and supporters of the Institute  This year is especially notable in the life of VMI  for not only is it the 40th anniversary of the creation of the Institute Society  but it marks the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  and the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  Earlier today  at the Founders Day Convocation  we celebrated that anniversary and welcomed Virginia s 72nd Governor  the Honorable Terry McAuliffe  who spoke to the VMI community gathered in Cameron Hall and to no surprise he declared amnesty for the Corps of Cadets  We followed that with the  Corps on Parade  How can any of us not be proud and stand tall watching the future of America pass by  it certainly gives me strength and great confidence in the Institute s and our nation s future  In my welcoming celebration convocation remarks this morning  I mentioned that the Institute was officially created two years before it actually began operations on 11 November 1839  The opening of the Institute had to be  postponed  because of the economic panic of that year   America s first depression   a financial downturn that strongly resembled what this nation has just endured  Undeterred  the Virginia General Assembly and the Institute s Founders   members of our first Board of Visitors along with Smith  Crozet  and Preston   did not give in or give up  but persevered and succeeded  And the Institute has lived on  through many other financial crises  the Civil War  the Great Depression of the 1930s  two World Wars  and other difficult times  Looking back over these eventful years and remarkable generations  we can truly say  that the Institute has had a glorious past and I think in the years ahead a brilliant future  for  VMI is truly a national treasure  For over a century and a half  VMI has provided leaders in science and engineering  education  the law  business  medicine  and the military   The Institute has fulfilled  an uncommon purpose  VMI fosters in its graduates values and capabilities for an expanding and extraordinarily complex world  Today  as we look at the Institute  we see a splendid academic program  a robust building plan to accommodate today s needs and tomorrow s opportunities   an athletic program that develops leaders   true student athletes with integrity  and a strong  vibrant  disciplined  and honorable Corps of Cadets  Like conditions at the founding of the Institute  however  economic reality presses hard on VMI  Declining state revenues have forced budget reductions  equally  in all the state colleges and universities across the Commonwealth  VMI s reductions have perhaps been felt greater than the average due mainly to its small size  compounded by VMI s significant growth in in state enrollment  thereby limiting higher paying out of state numbers   The growth in Virginia cadets ideally would have been accompanied by an increase in State general funds  but the State has lagged behind because of the two recessions which have occurred during the past decade    The situation is troubling  and there is  in my view after 12 years of working the halls of the Virginia legislature along with corporate business leaders who are equally concerned with an educated workforce for top jobs  little hope that things will  quickly  get better  Our state elected VMI friends have been incredibly helpful  particularly as regards construction resources  The lesson we have learned is that VMI cannot depend on State support in operational dollars for higher education  principally because of the decline in State revenues tied to reduced defense spending impacting Northern Virginia and the Hampton Roads   Norfolk areas  We must not continue to increase the cost of a VMI education for cadets and their families  It is not in our tradition  nor favorable to the kinds of young men and women we want to enter Jackson Arch as our future graduates  Understanding the decade long record of State budget reductions  we   the Institute   need to be in the position that insures every qualified cadet that we accept to VMI  should receive some form of need based financial support or other merit scholarship tuition assistance  This is among the priorities of the new VMI Campaign  a  comprehensive campaign which focuses on significant support for  academics  Corps life  athletics  preserving the Institute s growing historical activities  and  importantly  unrestricted  annual and endowment support  These combinations will provide a  value based  education  the very best in America  There will be numerous campaigns at VMI before the Institute reaches its 200th birthday in 2039  We should set  stretch  and achieve a VMI Foundation endowment goal in 2039 of  2 0 billion dollars as we celebrate that Founders Day event  We can do that  We must do that  This campaign announcement this evening is a  wonderful first step  along that path that ensures our destiny and supports that 2039 goal  We are justifiably proud of the Institute s academic program and its talented faculty  We have limited degrees and they are all challenging  Greater than 50 percent of the Corps major in math  science  or engineering  All of our full time faculty hold the Ph D  degree  and all of our faculty teach  We have small classes and an excellent ratio of one faculty member to 12 cadets  We have partnerships with the best graduate schools in the nation  we are nationally ranked and have excellent high tech classrooms and facilities  Our cadet athletes are student athletes  setting a standard for America  One result  of many  is that 98 percent of our cadets annually have jobs at graduation  an unheard achievement in these economic times  All of this and more makes VMI distinctive and highly successful   And all of this comes with high costs that increase with each year   Excellence costs  But  the return on the investment is more than justified  as the splendid record of our alumni abundantly testifies leaders of the Commonwealth and our nation disproportionate to any in the nation  VMI graduates are trusted  Unfailing  They hone their sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust athletic program  The VMI experience prepares them for the life ahead  a life of strength  honor  and integrity  The VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  and perseverance   is the common bond of these true citizen soldiers who  in the military or as civilians  serve the nation in times of peace and of deepest peril  In the coming weeks and months  you will hear a lot about this VMI Campaign  and I believe you will be proud of what we will announce this evening  It is truly a team effort and I commend the staffs and volunteers of the VMI Foundation  the Keydet Club  the Alumni Association  our Parents Council  and the Campaign Cabinet for their dedication to the campaign s success  I express my heartfelt appreciation to all of our donors  past and present  who have made possible so much that has allowed VMI to thrive through its long history  And  I express my special thanks to all of you gathered here tonight  The Institute Society has made an enormous difference in the life of VMI  not only through your generosity  but your commitment to the mission of the Institute and your faith in its brilliant future  It is my pleasure  as we launch our next campaign  to introduce the gentleman who leads this important fund raising effort  Mr  Donald M  Wilkinson  Jr   He is a graduate of the Institute and a graduate of the Darden School of Business at the University of Virginia  He served as an officer in the U S  Army during the Cold War  and then founded Wilkinson O
