New Market Ceremony History A History of the VMI New Market Ceremony New Market Resources Home The 19th Century Commemorations  The VMI Corps of Cadets fought as a unit at the Battle of New Market on May 15  1864  ten cadets died as a result of their wounds  In the Spring of 1866 the remains of Cadets Jones  McDowell  Jefferson  Wheelwright  and Atwill were brought to VMI for reburial  On May 15  the second anniversary of the battle  the bodies were escorted in a procession of the Corps of Cadets from the VMI hospital to the town s Presbyterian Church  where memorial services were held  Following the ceremony  the bodies were placed in a vault in the old Porter s Lodge located near the Limit Gates  In 1878 the remains were moved to the newly created cadet cemetery  it no longer exists  located in a wooded area which now is the northwest corner of the parade ground  and in 1912 to their final graves under the statue  Virginia Mourning Her Dead  the monument to the New Market cadets which was dedicated in 1903  Although individual headstones mark their graves  the remains are actually buried in a copper box set into the foundation of the monument  A sixth grave   that of Crockett   was added in 1960  Four of the cadets are buried elsewhere  The Institute has always observed the anniversary of the battle  with a formal ceremony in place by 1878  coinciding with the establishment of the cadet cemetery  For the next 34 years  until 1912  a ceremony was held annually on May 15 in the cemetery  In 1887  the French custom of the roll call of the dead was first used in a New Market Day observance  and for many years it was the usual to have the roll call at every formation of the Corps on that day  This description of the 1890 ceremony is typical of the era   Tomorrow the 15th of May being the twenty sixth anniversary there will be suspension of all drills and academic duties  at 5 30 p m  the flags on the Barracks will be set at half staff  and the Band will assemble in the cemetery and play appropriate music while the graves of the youthful heroes who there lie buried are being strewn with flowers in grateful memory of their selfless devotion to the cause of their country   The Modern Era  In 1912 the New Market Monument was moved to its present location  and the bodies of cadets were relocated from the old cadet cemetery to a niche under the monument Since 1912  when a single location first marked both graves and memorial statue  the annual ceremony has taken place in front of the monument  Today  the New Market Ceremony commemorates not only the bravery of the Cadets called to the battle at New Market in 1864  but the sacrifice of all Institute alumni who have served our nation It is held during VMI s Finals Week celebrations  and is open to the public Visitors should contact the Communications and Marketing Office for up to date schedule information  The event consists of three parts  The Ceremonial Formation  The Corps of Cadets
