Historical Development of VMI Before its formation as an institution of higher education in 1839  VMI s site was occupied by an arsenal  one of three in the State of Virginia  The arsenal guard of some 20 soldiers  although living a strict military life while on duty  lacked self discipline  and their leisure time activities upset the decorum of Lexington  In 1834  several of Lexington s leading citizens  including attorney John Thomas Lewis Preston  proposed that the arsenal be transformed into a military college so the cadets could pursue educational courses while protecting the stand of arms  The plan led to legislation establishing the Virginia Military Institute  It was Preston  generally credited for conceiving the idea of VMI  and later one of the original members of the faculty  who gave the new institution its name   Virginia a State institution  neither sectional nor denominational  Military its characteristic feature  Institute something different from either college or university  The three elements thus indicated are the basis of a triangular pyramid  of which the sides will preserve their mutual relation to whatever height the structure may rise  On November 11  1839  23 young Virginians were mustered into the service of the State and  in a falling snow the first cadet sentry  John B  Strange  relieved the old arsenal guard  To this day cadets perform guard duty and serve the State as a military corps  as the first Corps of Cadets did  Professor  later Major General  Francis H  Smith  a graduate of the United States Military Academy  was named the first Superintendent of VMI and presided over the affairs of the Institute for its first half century  During his 50 year tenure  the Corps increased in size  the curriculum broadened  and the faculty grew  Among them was a moody  eccentric professor of  natural philosophy physics  it is called today named Thomas Jonathan Jackson  who joined the faculty in 1851 and served until April  1861  At the outbreak of the Civil War  he resumed military duty and became a general of the Confederate forces  earning the name  Stonewall  Jackson  He is considered one of the greatest commanders in military history  The first president of the Board of Visitors was Colonel Claudius Crozet  a graduate of Ecole Polytechnique and former faculty member at West Point  who was the State engineer of Virginia at the time of his election to the board  With the outbreak of the war  the Cadet Corps  under command of its professor of physics  Major Jackson  was ordered to train recruits for the Confederate Army in the Richmond area  The Corps was later reconstituted at the Institute to supply officers for the Southern armies  The Cadet Corps was called into active service a number of times in the Valley of Virginia during the next three years  On May 15  1863  the Corps of Cadets escorted the body of  Stonewall  Jackson to his grave in Lexington  after his death in the battle of Chancellorsville  Just before the battle  Jackson  after surveying the field and seeing so many VMI men around him in key positions  spoke the oft quoted words   The Institute will be heard from today  One year to the day after the funeral of Jackson  the VMI Cadet Corps was engaged as a unit in pitched battle  Called upon to bolster the Southern line against the advance of Union General Franz Sigel  the Corps marched down the valley to New Market and  in the battle fought there  won credit for helping turn the tide in favor of the Confederate forces  Ten cadets were killed and 47 wounded  Six of the dead are buried on the VMI grounds  The Corps of Cadets pays tribute to the courage and valor of the New Market Cadets in formal ceremonies held at the Institute yearly on May 15  The Institute was shelled and burned on June 12  1864  by Union forces under the command of General David Hunter  The courageous efforts of General Smith and dedicated members of the faculty allowed the Institute to reopen on October 17  1865  The devoted service of the thirteen Superintendents who have followed General Smith has enabled the Institute to strengthen its position as a uniquely valuable source of honorable and dedicated citizen soldiers for the Commonwealth and the nation  Among VMI graduates are General of the Army George C  Marshall  Class of 1901  the World War II Army Chief of Staff  architect of the Marshall Plan and Nobel Peace Prize winner  and Jonathan M  Daniels  Class of 1961  murdered during the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960s and named a Lesser Saint of the Episcopal Church for his sacrifice  Early in VMI history  Colonel Preston declared that the Institute s unique program would produce  fair specimens of citizen soldiers  and this observation has been substantiated by the service of VMI graduates in peace and war  Since the Institute was founded  VMI alumni have fought in every war involving the United States  starting with the Mexican War just four years after VMI graduated its first class  VMI alumni continue to serve their nation with 266 having achieved the rank of General or Flag officer in the Armed Forces of the United States and several foreign countries  most notably Thailand and the Republic of China  During World Wars I and II  the Korean War  and the Vietnam War  over 300 alumni gave the ultimate sacrifice in service to their country  and two alumni were killed during Operation Desert Storm  Two VMI alumni were among those killed on September 11  2001 in the terrorist attacks on America and 12 alumni have been killed in Iraq and Afghanistan  VMI is proud of its uniquely rigorous and constantly evolving system of education  and its earned reputation as one of America s premier institutions of higher education  Our mission of producing leaders   educated men and women of unimpeachable character and absolute integrity   remains our clear focus today and for the future  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
