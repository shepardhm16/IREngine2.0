her senior thesis project in biochemistry    VMI Photo by Kevin Remington  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  19  2012   At one time or another  chemistry professor Lt  Col  Dan McCain meets in his classes most of the cadets preparing for medical school   no matter whether they are biology majors or chemistry majors  That s because McCain teaches biochemistry  a course that is increasingly important to cadets preparing for medical school as an area of major emphasis in the upcoming revised MCAT   Biochemistry is going to be virtually required in the future  said McCain  who serves as the chemistry department s premed adviser  He noted that VMI s chemistry department won t need to make many curriculum adjustments when the new test is launched because it already offers two semesters of biochemistry and a lab  The courses are part of a concentration in biochemistry and molecular biology that McCain encourages all cadets preparing for medical school to take  The concentration requires courses in genetics and cell biology offered by the biology department in addition to chemistry classes  Biochemistry and cell and molecular biology  McCain pointed out  are closely related fields   When you get below the level of the cell and you study individual molecules that make up your cell  you re in the region that is both biology and chemistry  he said  The course focuses heavily on proteins  which are molecules made up of many smaller molecules  Premed cadets often first learn about these smaller molecules in their organic chemistry class  a perquisite for biochemistry  Looked at another way  McCain s biochemistry class teaches cadets that the things going on in their bodies are the results of the laws of chemistry and physics   their bodies are  in effect  chemical systems   There s a huge amount of chemistry content in medical school  explained McCain   When you go to see your doctor  they re going to prescribe a drug  That drug has a specific chemical mechanism of action in your body  Not only does biochemistry prepare students to think about the chemical systems underlying the biological systems  but it also teaches skills sets that are important to success in medical school  skill sets that many cadets find challenging to master   I think it s hard because it s a combination between knowing a lot and being able to think critically and being able to do spacial reasoning and being able to do quantitative math problems   and just knowing some basic biological processes also  said McCain  McCain also advises cadets to prepare for medical school outside the classroom and lab   I steer them in the direction of making sure that they are shadowing doctors and volunteering in hospitals  said McCain  And he advises them to pursue undergraduate research in any of the sciences  whether at VMI or through the National Science Foundation s Research Experiences for Undergraduates program  which has offered off post research experiences to several chemistry majors in recent years  Cadets hoping to go on to medical school find ample opportunities to prepare at VMI  whether they choose biology  chemistry  or some other major   What we have seen is that our chemistry students that want to go to medical school   take our strong chemistry curriculum and fill in with biology courses that round out their premed focus  said chemistry department head Col  Darren Timmons   Then they go on to be very successful  both getting into medical school and succeeding while they re there   Sherri Tombarge  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams

relevant education within a military environment  It s an education that develops character  fosters a lifelong appreciation of physical fitness engenders a sense of responsibility to others  and cultivates the ability to master adversity  VIRGINIA MILITARY INSTITUTE Lexington  Virginia 24450 General Information   540  464 7230  Admissions  admissions vmi edu
