of Study   Engineering   ECE   Cadet Advising Advising  Life has but a handful of central conflicts  replayed by each person with the same ferocity and intensity as if they were the first  Zen Buddhist saying  Just like the quotation on life  there are a handful of deeply important  potentially life changing questions regarding students  academic careers that I hear many times  I ve arranged the most common below in the approximate chronological order of career development  from high school senior through first class year  Unfortunately I don t have the answers  but perhaps I can raise some new questions that aren t immediately obvious  Selecting a major  is ECE right for you  Ask yourself these questions when considering a major  Do you really enjoy learning it  Electrical engineering  for instance  is traditionally considered one of the toughest majors with heavy homework loads and relatively high dropout rates  No reason but finding it intrinsically fun will help you find the energy to finish that last problem set when it s 1AM and everyone else at VMI is asleep  If you are among the few that can t keep from asking  how does it work  when you see something new  if you ve taken apart even your most expensive toys from your earliest years  if find there s something inexplicably fascinating when you peer inside a computer or television set that you ve taken apart  then ECE may be your perfect match  Would you really enjoy doing it when you graduate  Do you know what professionals in your chosen major really do  If not  join a professional society as a student and find out  ECE has a very active student branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE  and we have monthly dinner meetings in Roanoke with other students and engineers  For that matter  can you do it when you graduate  There are some majors that have only very few post graduation opportunities  Get a copy of the Richmond Dispatch  or a newspaper from a major city near your hometown  and find out what jobs are being advertised  If you are commissioning  talk to your service representative and find out if there s a branch or assignment that fits your major  You ll have to do this anyway during your first class year  better do it early and avoid nasty surprises  Electrical and computer engineers are in worldwide short supply  and even in difficult economic times have little trouble finding employment  What kind of lifestyle do you want to have  Electrical engineers tend to earn a lot  ECE graduates have had higher average starting salaries than any other department for the past two years  although virtually tied with mechanical engineering  Engineers also tend to move frequently  about as frequently during the early career years as those in the military  To find out more about engineering as a career  visit the IEEE homepage for students  Finally  do you have the knack  Many successful students of engineering did not choose engineering  instead engineering chose them  Studying for engineering exams  Spend about 30 60 minutes quickly reviewing the text  While reviewing  start working each of the example problems  If you see how to set the problem up  don t waste time actually solving it  If you don t  stop and figure it out  Spend your remaining time  the majority of your time  working similar problems that you find in the board problem handouts homework problems student problem guide   Work a problem from each chapter  even if you feel confident in the material  Work additional problems in areas you identified that you feel weak  Only work problems that have solutions  but do not refer to the solutions unless you get really stuck or to check your answer  Don t fall into the trap of  speed preparing  by reading a problem and then immediately checking the solutions to see how should be worked   this is the most common studying pitfall I have seen and is not effective  Should I find a summer internship  You ll have to decide whether to spend the summer working at a company  doing research in VMI s SURI program  or just taking a long vacation  Being on a commissioning track still leaves time to do one of these three  Each of these options has its merits  and different ones are best for different people  or at different points in their cadet careers  Here are some reasons you may want to choose an internship  If you haven t worked in a company  you are ill prepared to make a decision about a job after graduation   You are also ill prepared to make the decision that you do not want to take a job  but instead prefer to go to graduate school  because you don t have information about industry  The same thing goes for learning about companies of specific size  big company  startup  etc  and particular types of work  programmer  sales  designer  tester  program manager  etc  Working in a company exposes you to a different way of thinking and working  This breadth of experience is likely to stand you in good stead when you approach problems  because you will be able to choose the most effective style rather than applying the same approach in every situation  Related to this point  internships develop skills from interpersonal interactions to specific development tools  A company may be the only or best way to obtain these skills  which you will find valuable in your future career as an engineer  Working on real products with real customers is particularly rewarding for some people  they like to see the concrete impact their jobs have on customers  on coworkers  and on the industry  It looks great on an application for a job or for graduate school  Forms  Institute academic forms  e g  to add drop  etc  Forms  Department academic forms  e g  concentration  minor  Declare a concentration  computer engineering vs  microelectronics  Declare a computer engineering minor How to get into graduate school  Graduate schools care about more than just grades  They want students who show initiative  who have sought out challenges in independent research  e g  VMI s URS or SURI program  who have found a summer internship  and who have held leadership positions  You can get into very competitive graduate schools if you have these distinguishing experiences even if you don t have a perfect GPA  but a 4 0 without these will probably earn you the  thin envelope  response to an application  Graduate schools place considerable emphasis on recommendations  Carefully consider whom to ask  and when you do  provide them with facts to help them write a good letter  Give them your resume and include whether you ve worked in any independent study projects  helped in any science fairs  open houses  IEEE activities  or honor societies  whether you re involved in any sports  clubs  or community activities  won recognition for anything you ve done in any group  tutored  volunteered  or done something unusual in another academic department  Take time to recall the events that distinguish you from the masses  Find out yourself what s important  Visit the school s webpage and download a copy of their application form  You may be surprised at what they value  and what they don t  M I T  for instance  won t even look at your GRE Engineering score if you send it to them  but they want a detailed account of engineering projects you have accomplished  Getting a great letter of recommendation  For every publicly announced scholarship or job there will be many tens  if not hundreds of applications  Think of a stack of resume s that are over an inch thick  Even if you have the right background  if you do the same thing every other applicant does  carefully complete the paperwork  put thought and multiple drafts into your essay  and ask professors with positive opinions of you to fill out a reference form  you have only have a small statistical chance at best  and even less if someone applies for the scholarship position that knows the following secret  You won t get a great letter of recommendation by giving your professor the recommendation form and hoping for the best  The most common result will be the professor will check the boxes  handwrite something like  Joe is an excellent student in my class and would make a great employee  in the essay portion  and sign his her name  While this type of recommendation is better than  Joe is a moron  and will keep your application from the immediate trash pile  it is only typical of what every other applicant is getting  and puts your paper in the thick wads of  maybes  If the job or scholarship is competitive  you ve just lost your chance  At worst  the professor will put the application in the to do pile  and attend instead to the current crises at hand  and come back to it two months later when the application deadline has expired  How should you do it  Offer to your professor to write your own recommendation and email it in editable format  It is presumptuous to hand your professor a recommendation ready for signature without asking if this is what he wants first  and it is almost guaranteed he will want to edit whatever you write anyway  But it is much easier and less time consuming to edit a rough draft than to start from a blank paper  and very few applicants will get their pushed for time professors to write a well written  comprehensive  typed essay  which by default will put your application into the reviewer s thin  first choice  pile  How should it be structured  It depends on the scholarship job  Read it carefully  and make sure your experiences address what the reviewing committee wants to see  Sometimes you must read between the lines to determine what the ideal qualifications are  An example  A military scholarship that sends an electrical engineering candidate to a language school probably has reviewers that want to see students with strong skills in leadership  it s the military  interpersonal relations  you ll be essentially serving in an ambassador role  a desire to learn about foreign cultures  and obviously  the innate talent to pick up foreign languages quickly  Since they re looking for electrical engineers  they probably also want to see how you can relate your creative analytic talents in engineering to a particular purpose that requires foreign language skill  perhaps you re interested in Military Intelligence and want to analyze foreign military weapons  I d recommend putting each of these categories into a bolded heading  and describing under each how your experiences and background make you a perfect match  How do you show your background experiences match the qualifications  You DO NOT want to restate things that are already in your resume  Joe s choice to join military ROTC training shows he has leadership skills  Even worse  do not simply state what you want the reviewer to believe  Joe is a very good leader  a sure shortcut to the trash pile  Instead  give plenty of examples that you have demonstrated in your reviewing professor s class that are not mentioned in your resume  Carrying the above example further  under the leadership bullet  you could write  Joe is a natural leader  in my laboratories the other students turn to him for advice and can often be seen huddling around his desk asking for help  I have observed the manner in which he assists them  and rather than simply solving the problem for them he leads them through the Socratic process of asking pointed questions that help them solve their own problems  thus building their independence  Won t this take a lot of time to write for each professor  Absolutely  This is why so few students do it  and why it s actually fairly easy for a reviewer to take 100 applications and quickly cull them down to 3 or 4 that actually stand a chance  Think of it this way  if it takes an additional 4 hours per professor  and you have 3 references that you need for a  12 000 scholarship  it s a  1 000 an hour investment in time you are taking to do it right  It s hard to find a campus job that pays that well  Selecting a graduate school  There are over 120 schools in the United States alone that offer graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering  One easy way to help you narrow your choices is to first decide what kind of degree you want  Contrary to popular understanding  the degree following a B S  in engineering may be either of two types of Masters degrees  or you may proceed directly to a Ph D  Here are some questions that may help  Do you want a Masters degree to work in industry  Perhaps you desire a consulting career with Anderson Consulting  you will then want what s often called an  Industrial Masters  These degree programs are course heavy  usually 10  research light  and focused on exposing you to practical skills and tools to let you hit the ground running on graduation  They typically take 12 18 months to complete and may or may not require a short  usually 6 month  thesis experience  Often there is an opportunity for a partial but not full tuition waiver if you agree to work as a teaching assistant  Not all universities offer this program  and those that do call it different things  call the graduate admissions office to find out  Do you think you want a PhD but want to get a Masters first  This will take longer than going straight for the PhD  but will keep your options open should you change your mind  This route will require what some universities call a  Science Masters  or a  Research Masters  These programs are course light  research heavy  and will prepare you for a career in engineering research  They typically take 24 30 months  always require a substantial thesis   and nearly always provide free tuition and a monthly stipend in return for teaching undergraduates  Once you begin a research project you may also compete for university or federal fellowships which also provide free tuition and a stipend  or receive research funding from your advisor  During the first few months you will interview with a variety of professors and select one whom you trust and is doing research you find fascinating  that professor will become your advisor  This is much more of a mentor apprenticeship learning experience than the industrial masters  Universities that do not offer a Ph D  will not have a science masters program  although universities that do may have only a science masters  e g  M I T  may have only an industrial masters  e g  Monmouth  or may have both  e g  Cornell  Do you know you want a doctorate  Perhaps you dream of returning to VMI as a professor  or want to perform cutting edge research in an R D laboratory  You will need a Ph D  to do these things  and you can earn one a few years faster by not obtaining a Masters degree first  Unlike many non engineering doctoral programs  you can expect full support during your doctoral program from a mixture of Teaching Assistantships  Research Assistantships  and fellowships  which will provide both tuition and a stipend  typically about 15k year  Universities structure PhD programs radically differently  some require a relatively heavy course load  some are entirely research focused  and the average length of time varies from a low of just over three years to a high of nearly eight  Some require a single doctoral qualification examination that s administered 6 months after arrival  some have a series of exams that continue for your first 3 years  The number of hurdles is often linked to prestige of the school Find out the details with a call to the graduate office before you apply and avoid unpleasant surprises  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families

average starting salaries than any other department for the past two years  although virtually tied with mechanical engineering  Engineers also tend to move frequently  about as frequently during the early career years as those in the military  To find out more about engineering as a career  visit the IEEE homepage for students  Finally  do you have the knack  Many successful students of engineering did not choose engineering  instead engineering chose them  Studying for engineering exams  Spend about 30 60 minutes quickly reviewing the text  While reviewing  start working each of the example problems  If you see how to set the problem up  don t waste time actually solving it  If you don t  stop and figure it out  Spend your remaining time  the majority of your time  working similar problems that you find in the board problem handouts homework problems student problem guide   Work a problem from each chapter  even if you feel confident in the material  Work additional problems in areas you identified that you feel weak  Only work problems that have solutions  but do not refer to the solutions unless you get really stuck or to check your answer  Don t fall into the trap of  speed preparing  by reading a problem and then immediately checking the solutions to see how should be worked   this is the most common studying pitfall I have seen and is not effective  Should I find a summer internship  You ll have to decide whether to spend the summer working at a company  doing research in VMI s SURI program  or just taking a long vacation  Being on a commissioning track still leaves time to do one of these three  Each of these options has its merits  and different ones are best for different people  or at different points in their cadet careers  Here are some reasons you may want to choose an internship  If you haven t worked in a company  you are ill prepared to make a decision about a job after graduation   You are also ill prepared to make the decision that you do not want to take a job  but instead prefer to go to graduate school  because you don t have information about industry  The same thing goes for learning about companies of specific size  big company  startup  etc  and particular types of work  programmer  sales  designer  tester  program manager  etc  Working in a company exposes you to a different way of thinking and working  This breadth of experience is likely to stand you in good stead when you approach problems  because you will be able to choose the most effective style rather than applying the same approach in every situation  Related to this point  internships develop skills from interpersonal interactions to specific development tools  A company may be the only or best way to obtain these skills  which you will find valuable in your future career as an engineer  Working on real products with real customers is particularly rewarding for some people  they like to see the concrete impact their jobs have on customers  on coworkers  and on the industry  It looks great on an application for a job or for graduate school  Forms  Institute academic forms  e g  to add drop  etc  Forms  Department

care about more than just grades  They want students who show initiative  who have sought out challenges in independent research  e g  VMI s URS or SURI program  who have found a summer internship  and who have held leadership positions  You can get into very competitive graduate schools if you have these distinguishing experiences even if you don t have a perfect GPA  but a 4 0 without these will probably earn you the  thin envelope  response to an application  Graduate schools place considerable emphasis on recommendations  Carefully consider whom to ask  and when you do  provide them with facts to help them write a good letter  Give them your resume and include whether you ve worked in any independent study projects  helped in any science fairs  open houses  IEEE activities  or honor societies  whether you re involved in any sports  clubs  or community activities  won recognition for anything you ve done in any group  tutored  volunteered  or done something unusual in another academic department  Take time to recall the events that distinguish you from the masses  Find out yourself what s important  Visit the school s webpage and download a copy of their application form  You may be surprised at what they value  and what they don t  M I T  for instance  won t even look at your GRE Engineering score if you send it to them  but they want a detailed account of engineering projects you have accomplished  Getting a great letter of recommendation  For every publicly announced scholarship or job there will be many tens  if not hundreds of applications  Think of a stack of resume s that are over an inch thick  Even if you have the right background  if you do the same thing every other applicant does  carefully complete the paperwork  put thought and multiple drafts into your essay  and ask professors with positive opinions of you to fill out a reference form  you have only have a small statistical chance at best  and even less if someone applies for the scholarship position that knows the following secret  You won t get a great letter of recommendation by giving your professor the recommendation form and hoping for the best  The most common result will be the professor will check the boxes  handwrite something like  Joe is an excellent student in my class and would make a great employee  in the essay portion  and sign his her name  While this type of recommendation is better than  Joe is a moron  and will keep your application from the immediate trash pile  it is only typical of what every other applicant is getting  and puts your paper in the thick wads of  maybes  If the job or scholarship is competitive  you ve just lost your chance  At worst  the professor will put the application in the to do pile  and attend instead to the current crises at hand  and come back to it two months later when the application deadline has expired  How should you do it  Offer to your professor to write your own recommendation and email it in editable format  It is presumptuous to hand your professor a recommendation ready for signature without asking if this is what he wants first  and it is almost guaranteed he will want to edit whatever you write anyway  But it is much easier and less time consuming to edit a rough draft than to start from a blank paper  and very few applicants will get their pushed for time professors to write a well written  comprehensive  typed essay  which by default will put your application into the reviewer s thin  first choice  pile  How should it be structured  It depends on the scholarship job  Read it carefully  and make sure your experiences address what the reviewing committee wants to see  Sometimes you must read between the lines to determine what the ideal qualifications are  An example  A military scholarship that sends an electrical engineering candidate to a language school probably has reviewers that want to see students with strong skills in leadership  it s the military  interpersonal relations  you ll be essentially serving in an ambassador role  a desire to learn about foreign cultures  and obviously  the innate talent to pick up foreign languages quickly  Since they re looking for electrical engineers  they probably also want to see how you can relate your creative analytic talents in engineering to a particular purpose that requires foreign language skill  perhaps you re interested in Military Intelligence and want to analyze foreign military weapons  I d recommend putting each of these categories into a bolded heading  and describing under each how your experiences and background make you a perfect match  How do you show your background experiences match the qualifications  You DO NOT want to restate things that are already in your resume  Joe s choice to join military ROTC training shows he has leadership skills  Even worse  do not simply state what you want the reviewer to believe  Joe is a very good leader  a sure shortcut to the trash pile  Instead  give plenty of examples that you have demonstrated in your reviewing professor s class that are not mentioned in your resume  Carrying the above example further  under the leadership bullet  you could write  Joe is a natural leader  in my laboratories the other students turn to him for advice and can often be seen huddling around his desk asking for help  I have observed the manner in which he assists them  and rather than simply solving the problem for them he leads them through the Socratic process of asking pointed questions that help them solve their own problems  thus building their independence  Won t this take a lot of time to write for each professor  Absolutely  This is why so few students do it  and why it s actually fairly easy for a reviewer to take 100 applications and quickly cull them down to 3 or 4 that actually stand a chance  Think of it this way  if it takes an additional 4 hours per professor  and you have 3 references that you need for a  12 000 scholarship  it s a  1 000 an hour investment in time you are taking to do it right  It s hard to find a campus job that pays that well  Selecting a graduate school  There are over 120 schools in the United States alone that offer graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering  One easy way to help you narrow your choices is to first decide what kind of degree you want  Contrary to popular understanding  the degree following a B S  in engineering may be either of two types of Masters degrees  or you may proceed directly to a Ph D  Here are some questions that may help  Do you want a Masters degree to work in industry  Perhaps you desire a consulting career with Anderson Consulting  you will then want what s often called an  Industrial Masters  These degree programs are course heavy  usually 10  research light  and focused on exposing you to practical skills and tools to let you hit the ground running on graduation  They typically take 12 18 months to complete and may or may not require a short  usually 6 month  thesis experience  Often there is an opportunity for a partial but not full tuition waiver if you agree to work as a teaching assistant  Not all universities offer this program  and those that do call it different things  call the graduate admissions office to find out  Do you think you want a PhD but want to get a Masters first  This will take longer than going straight for the PhD  but will keep your options open should you change your mind  This route will require what some universities call a  Science Masters  or a  Research Masters  These programs are course light  research heavy  and will prepare you for a career in engineering research  They typically take 24 30 months  always require a substantial thesis   and nearly always provide free tuition and a monthly stipend in return for teaching undergraduates  Once you begin a research project you may also compete for university or federal fellowships which also provide free tuition and a stipend  or receive research funding from your advisor  During the first few months you will interview with a variety of professors and select one whom you trust and is doing research you find fascinating  that professor will become your advisor  This is much more of a mentor apprenticeship learning experience than the industrial masters  Universities that do not offer a Ph D  will not have a science masters program  although universities that do may have only a science masters  e g  M I T  may have only an industrial masters  e g  Monmouth  or may have both  e g  Cornell  Do you know you want a doctorate  Perhaps you dream of returning to VMI as a professor  or want to perform cutting edge research in an R D laboratory  You will need a Ph D  to do these things  and you can earn one a few years faster by not obtaining a Masters degree first  Unlike many non engineering doctoral programs  you can expect full support during your doctoral program from a mixture of Teaching Assistantships  Research Assistantships  and fellowships  which will provide both tuition and a stipend  typically about 15k year  Universities structure PhD programs radically differently  some require a relatively heavy course load  some are entirely research focused  and the average length of time varies from a low of just over three years to a high of nearly eight  Some require a single doctoral qualification examination that s administered 6 months after arrival  some have a series of exams that continue for your first 3 years  The number of hurdles is often linked to prestige of the school Find out the details with a call to the graduate office before you apply and avoid unpleasant surprises  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI

 Ask yourself these questions when considering a major  Do you really enjoy learning it  Electrical engineering  for instance  is traditionally considered one of the toughest majors with heavy homework loads and relatively high dropout rates  No reason but finding it intrinsically fun will help you find the energy to finish that last problem set when it s 1AM and everyone else at VMI is asleep  If you are among the few that can t keep from asking  how does it work  when you see something new  if you ve taken apart even your most expensive toys from your earliest years  if find there s something inexplicably fascinating when you peer inside a computer or television set that you ve taken apart  then ECE may be your perfect match  Would you really enjoy doing it when you graduate  Do you know what professionals in your chosen major really do  If not  join a professional society as a student and find out  ECE has a very active student branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE  and we have monthly dinner meetings in Roanoke with other students and engineers  For that matter  can you do it when you graduate  There are some majors that have only very few post graduation opportunities  Get a copy of the Richmond Dispatch  or a newspaper from a major city near your hometown  and find out what jobs are being advertised  If you are commissioning  talk to your service representative and find out if there s a branch or assignment that fits your major  You ll have to do this anyway during your first class year  better do it early and avoid nasty

consider whom to ask  and when you do  provide them with facts to help them write a good letter  Give them your resume and include whether you ve worked in any independent study projects  helped in any science fairs  open houses  IEEE activities  or honor societies  whether you re involved in any sports  clubs  or community activities  won recognition for anything you ve done in any group  tutored  volunteered  or done something unusual in another academic department  Take time to recall the events that distinguish you from the masses  Find out yourself what s important  Visit the school s webpage and download a copy of their application form  You may be surprised at what they value  and what they don t  M I T  for instance  won t even look at your GRE Engineering score if you send it to them  but they want a detailed account of engineering projects you have accomplished  Getting a great letter of recommendation  For every publicly announced scholarship or job there will be many tens  if not hundreds of applications  Think of a stack of resume s that are over an inch thick  Even if you have the right background  if you do the same thing every other applicant does  carefully complete the paperwork  put thought and multiple drafts into your essay  and ask professors with positive opinions of you to fill out a reference form  you have only have a small statistical chance at best  and even less if someone applies for the scholarship position that knows the following secret  You won t get a great letter of recommendation by giving your professor the recommendation form and hoping for the best  The most common result will be the professor will check the boxes  handwrite something like  Joe is an excellent student in my class and would make a great employee  in the essay portion  and sign his her name  While this type of recommendation is better than  Joe is a moron  and will keep your application from the immediate trash pile  it is only typical of what every other applicant is getting  and puts your paper in the thick wads of  maybes  If the job or scholarship is competitive  you ve just lost your chance  At worst  the professor will put the application in the to do pile  and attend instead to the current crises at hand  and come back to it two months later when the application deadline has expired  How should you do it  Offer to your professor to write your own recommendation and email it in editable format  It is presumptuous to hand your professor a recommendation ready for signature without asking if this is what he wants first  and it is almost guaranteed he will want to edit whatever you write anyway  But it is much easier and less time consuming to edit a rough draft than to start from a blank paper  and very few applicants will get their pushed for time professors to write a well written  comprehensive  typed essay  which by default will put your application into the reviewer s thin  first choice  pile  How should it be structured  It depends on the scholarship job  Read it carefully  and make sure your experiences address what the reviewing committee wants to see  Sometimes you must read between the lines to determine what the ideal qualifications are  An example  A military scholarship that sends an electrical engineering candidate to a language school probably has reviewers that want to see students with strong skills in leadership  it s the military  interpersonal relations  you ll be essentially serving in an ambassador role  a desire to learn about foreign cultures  and obviously  the innate talent to pick up foreign languages quickly  Since they re looking for electrical engineers  they probably also want to see how you can relate your creative analytic talents in engineering to a particular purpose that requires foreign language skill  perhaps you re interested in Military Intelligence and want to analyze foreign military weapons  I d recommend putting each of these categories into a bolded heading  and describing under each how your experiences and background make you a perfect match  How do you show your background experiences match the qualifications  You DO NOT want to restate things that are already in your resume  Joe s choice to join military ROTC training shows he has leadership skills  Even worse  do not simply state what you want the reviewer to believe  Joe is a very good leader  a sure shortcut to the trash pile  Instead  give plenty of examples that you have demonstrated in your reviewing professor s class that are not mentioned in your resume  Carrying the above example further  under the leadership bullet  you could write  Joe is a natural leader  in my laboratories the other students turn to him for advice and can often be seen huddling around his desk asking for help  I have observed the manner in which he assists them  and rather than simply solving the problem for them he leads them through the Socratic process of asking pointed questions that help them solve their own problems  thus building their independence  Won t this take a lot of time to write for each professor  Absolutely  This is why so few students do it  and why it s actually fairly easy for a reviewer to take 100 applications and quickly cull them down to 3 or 4 that actually stand a chance  Think of it this way  if it takes an additional 4 hours per professor  and you have 3 references that you need for a  12 000 scholarship  it s a  1 000 an hour investment in time you are taking to do it right  It s hard to find a campus job that pays that well  Selecting a graduate school  There are over 120 schools in the United States alone that offer graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering  One easy way to help you narrow your choices is to first decide what kind of degree you want  Contrary to popular understanding  the degree following a B S  in engineering may be either of two types of Masters degrees  or you may proceed directly to a Ph D  Here are some questions that may help  Do you want a Masters degree to work in industry  Perhaps you desire a consulting career with Anderson Consulting  you will then want what s often called an  Industrial Masters  These degree programs are course heavy  usually 10  research light  and focused on exposing you to practical skills and tools to let you hit the ground running on graduation  They typically take 12 18 months to complete and may or may not require a short  usually 6 month  thesis experience  Often there is an opportunity for a partial but not full tuition waiver if you agree to work as a teaching assistant  Not all universities offer this program  and those that do call it different things  call the graduate admissions office to find out  Do you think you want a PhD but want to get a Masters first  This will take longer than going straight for the PhD  but will keep your options open should you change your mind  This route will require what some universities call a  Science Masters  or a  Research Masters  These programs are course light  research heavy  and will prepare you for a career in engineering research  They typically take 24 30 months  always require a substantial thesis   and nearly always provide free tuition and a monthly stipend in return for teaching undergraduates  Once you begin a research project you may also compete for university or federal fellowships which also provide free tuition and a stipend  or receive research funding from your advisor  During the first few months you will interview with a variety of professors and select one whom you trust and is doing research you find fascinating  that professor will become your advisor  This is much more of a mentor apprenticeship learning experience than the industrial masters  Universities that do not offer a Ph D  will not have a science masters program  although universities that do may have only a science masters  e g  M I T  may have only an industrial masters  e g  Monmouth  or may have both  e g  Cornell  Do you know you want a doctorate  Perhaps you dream of returning to VMI as a professor  or want to perform cutting edge research in an R D laboratory  You will need a Ph D  to do these things  and you can earn one a few years faster by not obtaining a Masters degree first  Unlike many non engineering doctoral programs  you can expect full support during your doctoral program from a mixture of Teaching Assistantships  Research Assistantships  and fellowships  which will provide both tuition and a stipend  typically about 15k year  Universities structure PhD programs radically differently  some require a relatively heavy course load  some are entirely research focused  and the average length of time varies from a low of just over three years to a high of nearly eight  Some require a single doctoral qualification examination that s administered 6 months after arrival  some have a series of exams that continue for your first 3 years  The number of hurdles is often linked to prestige of the school Find out the details with a call to the graduate office before you apply and avoid unpleasant surprises  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni

but a handful of central conflicts  replayed by each person with the same ferocity and intensity as if they were the first  Zen Buddhist saying  Just like the quotation on life  there are a handful of deeply important  potentially life changing questions regarding students  academic careers that I hear many times  I ve arranged the most common below in the approximate chronological order of career development  from high school senior through first class year  Unfortunately I don t have the answers  but perhaps I can raise some new questions that aren t immediately obvious  Selecting a major  is ECE right for you  Ask yourself these questions when considering a major  Do you really enjoy learning it  Electrical engineering  for instance  is traditionally considered one of the toughest majors with heavy homework loads and relatively high dropout rates  No reason but finding it intrinsically fun will help you find the energy to finish that last problem set when it s 1AM and everyone else at VMI is asleep  If you are among the few that can t keep from asking  how does it work  when you see something new  if you ve taken apart even your most expensive toys from your earliest years  if find there s something inexplicably fascinating when you peer inside a computer or television set that you ve taken apart  then ECE may be your perfect match  Would you really enjoy doing it when you graduate  Do you know what professionals in your chosen major really do  If not  join a professional society as a student and find out  ECE has a very active student branch of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers  IEEE  and we have monthly dinner meetings in Roanoke with other students and engineers  For that matter  can you do it when you graduate  There are some majors that have only very few post graduation opportunities  Get a copy of the Richmond Dispatch  or a newspaper from a major city near your hometown  and find out what jobs are being advertised  If you are commissioning  talk to your service representative and find out if there s a branch or assignment that fits your major  You ll have to do this anyway during your first class year  better do it early and avoid nasty surprises  Electrical and computer engineers are in worldwide short supply  and even in difficult economic times have little trouble finding employment  What kind of lifestyle do you want to have  Electrical engineers tend to earn a lot  ECE graduates have had higher average starting salaries than any other department for the past two years  although virtually tied with mechanical engineering  Engineers also tend to move frequently  about as frequently during the early career years as those in the military  To find out more about engineering as a career  visit the IEEE homepage for students  Finally  do you have the knack  Many successful students of engineering did not choose engineering  instead engineering chose them  Studying for engineering exams  Spend about 30 60 minutes quickly reviewing the text  While reviewing  start working each of the example problems  If you see how to set the problem up  don t waste time actually solving it  If you don t  stop and figure it out  Spend your remaining time  the majority of your time  working similar problems that you find in the board problem handouts homework problems student problem guide   Work a problem from each chapter  even if you feel confident in the material  Work additional problems in areas you identified that you feel weak  Only work problems that have solutions  but do not refer to the solutions unless you get really stuck or to check your answer  Don t fall into the trap of  speed preparing  by reading a problem and then immediately checking the solutions to see how should be worked   this is the most common studying pitfall I have seen and is not effective  Should I find a summer internship  You ll have to decide whether to spend the summer working at a company  doing research in VMI s SURI program  or just taking a long vacation  Being on a commissioning track still leaves time to do one of these three  Each of these options has its merits  and different ones are best for different people  or at different points in their cadet careers  Here are some reasons you may want to choose an internship  If you haven t worked in a company  you are ill prepared to make a decision about a job after graduation   You are also ill prepared to make the decision that you do not want to take a job  but instead prefer to go to graduate school  because you don t have information about industry  The same thing goes for learning about companies of specific size  big company  startup  etc  and particular types of work  programmer  sales  designer  tester  program manager  etc  Working in a company exposes you to a different way of thinking and working  This breadth of experience is likely to stand you in good stead when you approach problems  because you will be able to choose the most effective style rather than applying the same approach in every situation  Related to this point  internships develop skills from interpersonal interactions to specific development tools  A company may be the only or best way to obtain these skills  which you will find valuable in your future career as an engineer  Working on real products with real customers is particularly rewarding for some people  they like to see the concrete impact their jobs have on customers  on coworkers  and on the industry  It looks great on an application for a job or for graduate school  Forms  Institute academic forms  e g  to add drop  etc  Forms  Department academic forms  e g  concentration  minor  Declare a concentration  computer engineering vs  microelectronics  Declare a computer engineering minor How to get into graduate school  Graduate schools care about more than just grades  They want students who show initiative  who have sought out challenges in independent research  e g  VMI s URS or SURI program  who have found a summer internship  and who have held leadership positions  You can get into very competitive graduate schools if you have these distinguishing experiences even if you don t have a perfect GPA  but a 4 0 without these will probably earn you the  thin envelope  response to an application  Graduate schools place considerable emphasis on recommendations  Carefully consider whom to ask  and when you do  provide them with facts to help them write a good letter  Give them your resume and include whether you ve worked in any independent study projects  helped in any science fairs  open houses  IEEE activities  or honor societies  whether you re involved in any sports  clubs  or community activities  won recognition for anything you ve done in any group  tutored  volunteered  or done something unusual in another academic department  Take time to recall the events that distinguish you from the masses  Find out yourself what s important  Visit the

in Roanoke with other students and engineers  For that matter  can you do it when you graduate  There are some majors that have only very few post graduation opportunities  Get a copy of the Richmond Dispatch  or a newspaper from a major city near your hometown  and find out what jobs are being advertised  If you are commissioning  talk to your service representative and find out if there s a branch or assignment that fits your major  You ll have to do this anyway during your first class year  better do it early and avoid nasty surprises  Electrical and computer engineers are in worldwide short supply  and even in difficult economic times have little trouble finding employment  What kind of lifestyle do you want to have  Electrical engineers tend to earn a lot  ECE graduates have had higher average starting salaries than any other department for the past two years  although virtually tied with mechanical engineering  Engineers also tend to move frequently  about as frequently during the early career years as those in the military  To find out more about engineering as a career  visit the IEEE homepage for students  Finally  do you have the knack  Many successful students of engineering did not choose engineering  instead engineering chose them  Studying for engineering exams  Spend about 30 60 minutes quickly reviewing the text  While reviewing  start working each of the example problems  If you see how to set the problem up  don t waste time actually solving it  If you don t  stop and figure it out  Spend your remaining time  the majority of your time  working similar problems that you find in the board problem handouts homework problems student problem guide   Work a problem from each chapter  even if you feel confident in the material  Work additional problems in areas you identified that you feel weak  Only work problems that have solutions  but do not refer to the solutions unless you get really stuck or to check your answer  Don t fall into the trap of  speed preparing  by reading a problem and then immediately checking the solutions to see how should be worked   this is the most common studying pitfall I have seen and is not effective  Should I find a summer internship  You ll have to decide whether to spend the summer working at a company  doing research in VMI s SURI program  or just taking a long vacation  Being on a commissioning track still leaves time to do one of these three  Each of these options has its merits  and different ones are best for different people  or at different points in their cadet careers  Here are some reasons you may want to choose an internship  If you haven t worked in a company  you are ill prepared to make a decision about a job after graduation   You are also ill prepared to make the decision that you do not want to take a job  but instead prefer to go to graduate school  because you don t have information about industry  The same thing goes for learning about companies of specific size  big company  startup  etc  and particular types of work  programmer  sales  designer  tester  program manager  etc  Working in a company exposes you to a different way of thinking and working  This breadth of experience is likely to stand you in good stead when you approach problems  because you will be able to choose the most effective style rather than applying the same approach in every situation  Related to this point  internships develop skills from interpersonal interactions to specific development tools  A company may be the only or best way to obtain these skills  which you will find valuable in your future career as an engineer  Working on real products with real customers is particularly rewarding for some people  they like to see the concrete impact their jobs have on customers  on coworkers  and on the industry  It looks great on an application for a job or for graduate school  Forms  Institute academic forms  e g  to add drop  etc  Forms  Department academic forms  e g  concentration  minor  Declare a concentration  computer engineering vs  microelectronics  Declare a computer engineering minor How to get into graduate school  Graduate schools care about more than just grades  They want students who show initiative  who have sought out challenges in independent research  e g  VMI s URS or SURI program  who have found a summer internship  and who have held leadership positions  You can get into very competitive graduate schools if you have these distinguishing experiences even if you don t have a perfect GPA  but a 4 0 without these will probably earn you the  thin envelope  response to an application  Graduate schools place considerable emphasis on recommendations  Carefully consider whom to ask  and when you do  provide them with facts to help them write a good letter  Give them your resume and include whether you ve worked in any independent study projects  helped in any science fairs  open houses  IEEE activities  or honor societies  whether you re involved in any sports  clubs  or community activities  won recognition for anything you ve done in any group  tutored  volunteered  or done something unusual in another academic department  Take time to recall the events that distinguish you from the masses  Find out yourself what s important  Visit the school s webpage and download a copy of their application form  You may be surprised at what they value  and what they don t  M I T  for instance  won t even look at your GRE Engineering score if you send it to them  but they want a detailed account of engineering projects you have accomplished  Getting a great letter of recommendation  For every publicly announced scholarship or job there will be many tens  if not hundreds of applications  Think of a stack of resume s that are over an inch thick  Even if you have the right background  if you do the same thing every other applicant does  carefully complete the paperwork  put thought and multiple drafts into your essay  and ask professors with positive opinions of you to fill out a reference form  you have only have a small statistical chance at best  and even less if someone applies for the scholarship position that knows the following secret  You won t get a great letter of recommendation by giving your professor the recommendation form and hoping for the best  The most common result will be the professor will check the boxes  handwrite something like  Joe is an excellent student in my class and would make a great employee  in the essay portion  and sign his her name  While this type of recommendation is better than  Joe is a moron  and will keep your application from the immediate trash pile  it is only typical of what every other applicant is getting  and puts your paper in the thick wads of  maybes  If the job or scholarship is competitive  you ve just lost your chance  At worst  the professor will put the application in the to do pile  and attend instead to the current crises at hand  and come back to it two months later when the application deadline has expired  How should you do it  Offer to your professor to write your own recommendation and email it in editable format  It is presumptuous to hand your professor a recommendation ready for signature without asking if this is what he wants first  and it is almost guaranteed he will want to edit whatever you write anyway  But it is much easier and less time consuming to edit a rough draft than to start from a blank paper  and very few applicants will get their pushed for time professors to write a well written  comprehensive  typed essay  which by default will put your application into the reviewer s thin  first choice  pile  How should it be structured  It depends on the scholarship job  Read it carefully  and make sure your experiences address what the reviewing committee wants to see  Sometimes you must read between the lines to determine what the ideal qualifications are  An example  A military scholarship that sends an electrical engineering candidate to a language school probably has reviewers that want to see students with strong skills in leadership  it s the military  interpersonal relations  you ll be essentially serving in an ambassador role  a desire to learn about foreign cultures  and obviously  the innate talent to pick up foreign languages quickly  Since they re looking for electrical engineers  they probably also want to see how you can relate your creative analytic talents in engineering to a particular purpose that requires foreign language skill  perhaps you re interested in Military Intelligence and want to analyze foreign military weapons  I d recommend putting each of these categories into a bolded heading  and describing under each how your experiences and background make you a perfect match  How do you show your background experiences match the qualifications  You DO NOT want to restate things that are already in your resume  Joe s choice to join military ROTC training shows he has leadership skills  Even worse  do not simply state what you want the reviewer to believe  Joe is a very good leader  a sure shortcut to the trash pile  Instead  give plenty of examples that you have demonstrated in your reviewing professor s class that are not mentioned in your resume  Carrying the above example further  under the leadership bullet  you could write  Joe is a natural leader  in my laboratories the other students turn to him for advice and can often be seen huddling around his desk asking for help  I have observed the manner in which he assists them  and rather than simply solving the problem for them he leads them through the Socratic process of asking pointed questions that help them solve their own problems  thus building their independence  Won t this take a lot of time to write for each professor  Absolutely  This is why so few students do it  and why it s actually fairly easy for a reviewer to take 100 applications and quickly cull them down to 3 or 4 that actually stand a chance  Think of it this way  if it takes an additional 4 hours per professor  and you have 3 references that you need for a  12 000 scholarship  it s a  1 000 an hour investment in time you are taking to do it right  It s hard to find a campus job that pays that well  Selecting a graduate school  There are over 120 schools in the United States alone that offer graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering  One easy way to help you narrow your choices is to first decide what kind of degree you want  Contrary to popular understanding  the degree following a B S  in engineering may be either of two types of Masters degrees  or you may proceed directly to a Ph D  Here are some questions that may help  Do you want a Masters degree to work in industry  Perhaps you desire a consulting career with Anderson Consulting  you will then want what s often called an  Industrial Masters  These degree programs are course heavy  usually 10  research light  and focused on exposing you to practical skills and tools to let you hit the ground running on graduation  They typically take 12 18 months to complete and may or may not require a short  usually 6 month  thesis experience  Often there is an opportunity for a partial but not full tuition waiver if you agree to work as a teaching assistant  Not all universities offer this program  and those that do call it different things  call the graduate admissions office to find out  Do you think you want a PhD but want to get a Masters first  This will take longer than going straight for the PhD  but will keep your options open should you change your mind  This route will require what some universities call a  Science Masters  or a  Research Masters  These programs are course light  research heavy  and will prepare you for a career in engineering research  They typically take 24 30 months  always require a substantial thesis   and nearly always provide free tuition and a monthly stipend in return for teaching undergraduates  Once you begin a research project you may also compete for university or federal fellowships which also provide free tuition and a stipend  or receive research funding from your advisor  During the first few months you will interview with a variety of professors and select one whom you trust and is doing research you find fascinating  that professor will become your advisor  This is much more of a mentor apprenticeship learning experience than the industrial masters  Universities that do not offer a Ph D  will not have a science masters program  although universities that do may have only a science masters  e g  M I T  may have only an industrial masters  e g  Monmouth  or may have both  e g  Cornell  Do you know you want a doctorate  Perhaps you dream of returning to VMI as a professor  or want to perform cutting edge research in an R D laboratory  You will need a Ph D  to do these things  and you can earn one a few years faster by not obtaining a Masters degree first  Unlike many non engineering doctoral programs  you can expect full support during your doctoral program from a mixture of Teaching Assistantships  Research Assistantships  and fellowships  which will provide both tuition and a stipend  typically about 15k year  Universities structure PhD programs radically differently  some require a relatively heavy course load  some are entirely research focused  and the average length of time varies from a low of just over three years to a high of nearly eight  Some require a single doctoral qualification examination that s administered 6 months after arrival  some have a series of exams that continue for your first 3 years  The number of hurdles is often linked to prestige of the school Find out the details with a call to the graduate office before you apply and avoid unpleasant surprises Home   Academics   Areas of Study   Engineering   ECE   Cadet Advising

regarding students  academic careers that I hear many times  I ve arranged the most common below in the approximate chronological order of career development  from high school senior through first class year  Unfortunately I don t have the answers  but perhaps I can raise some new questions that aren t immediately obvious  Selecting a major  is ECE right for you  Ask yourself these questions when considering a major  Do you really enjoy learning it  Electrical engineering  for instance  is traditionally considered one of the toughest majors with heavy homework loads and relatively high dropout rates  No reason but finding it intrinsically fun will help you find the energy to finish that last problem set when it s 1AM and everyone else at VMI is asleep  If you are among the few that can t keep from asking  how does it work  when you see something new  if you ve taken apart even your most expensive toys from your earliest years  if find there s something inexplicably fascinating

development tools  A company may be the only or best way to obtain these skills  which you will find valuable in your future career as an engineer Working on real products with real customers is particularly rewarding for some people  they like to see the concrete impact their jobs have on customers  on coworkers  and on the industry It looks great on an application for a job or for graduate

get into graduate school Graduate schools care about more than just grades  They want students who show initiative  who have sought out challenges in independent research  e g  VMI s URS or SURI program  who have found a summer internship  and who have held leadership positions  You can get into very competitive graduate schools if you have these distinguishing experiences even if you don t have a perfect GPA  but a 4 0 without these will probably earn you the  thin envelope  response to an application  Graduate schools place considerable emphasis on recommendations  Carefully consider whom to ask  and when you do  provide them with facts to help them write a good letter  Give them your resume and include whether you ve worked in any independent study projects  helped in any science fairs  open houses  IEEE activities  or honor societies  whether you re involved in any sports  clubs  or community activities  won recognition for anything you ve done in any group  tutored  volunteered  or done something unusual in another academic department  Take time to recall the events that distinguish you from the masses  Find out yourself what s important  Visit the school s webpage and download a copy of their application form  You may be surprised at what they value  and what they don t  M I T  for instance  won t even look at your GRE Engineering score if you send it to them  but they want a detailed account of engineering projects you have accomplished Graduate schools care about more than just grades  They want students who show initiative  who have sought out

even look at your GRE Engineering score if you send it to them  but they want a detailed account of engineering projects you have accomplished Getting a great letter of recommendation Getting a great letter of recommendation For every publicly announced scholarship or job there will be many tens  if not hundreds of applications  Think of a stack of resume s that are over an inch thick  Even if you have the right background  if you do the same thing every other applicant does  carefully complete the paperwork  put thought and multiple drafts into your essay  and ask professors with positive opinions of you to fill out a reference form  you have only have a small statistical chance at best  and even less if someone applies for the scholarship position that knows the following secret You won t get a great letter of recommendation by giving your professor the recommendation form and hoping for the best  The most common result will be the professor will check the boxes  handwrite something like  Joe is an excellent student in my class and would make a great employee  in the essay portion  and sign his her name  While this type of recommendation is better than  Joe is a moron  and will keep your application from the immediate trash pile  it is only typical of what every other applicant is getting  and puts your paper in the thick wads of  maybes  If the job or scholarship is competitive  you ve just lost your chance  At worst  the professor will put the application in the to do pile  and attend instead to the current crises at hand  and come back to it two months later when the application deadline has expired  How should you do it  Offer to your professor to write your own recommendation and email it in editable format  It is presumptuous to hand your professor a recommendation ready for signature without asking if this is what he wants first  and it is almost guaranteed he will want to edit whatever you write anyway  But it is much easier and less time consuming to edit a rough draft than to start from a blank paper  and very few applicants will get their pushed for time professors to write a well written  comprehensive  typed essay  which by default will put your application into the reviewer s thin  first choice  pile  How should it be structured  It depends on the scholarship job  Read it carefully  and make sure your experiences address what the reviewing committee wants to see  Sometimes you must read between the lines to determine what the ideal qualifications are  An example  A military scholarship that sends an electrical engineering candidate to a language school probably has reviewers that want to see students with strong skills in leadership  it s the military  interpersonal relations  you ll be essentially serving in an ambassador role  a desire to learn about foreign cultures  and obviously  the innate talent to pick up foreign languages quickly  Since they re looking for electrical engineers  they probably also want to see how you can relate your creative analytic talents in engineering to a particular purpose that requires foreign language skill  perhaps you re interested in Military Intelligence and want to analyze foreign military weapons  I d recommend putting each of these categories into a bolded heading  and describing under each how your experiences and background make you a perfect match  How do you show your background experiences match the qualifications  You DO NOT want to restate things that are already in your resume  Joe s choice to join military ROTC training shows he has leadership skills  Even worse  do not simply state what you want the reviewer to believe  Joe is a very good leader  a sure shortcut to the trash pile  Instead  give plenty of examples that you have demonstrated in your reviewing professor s class that are not mentioned in your resume  Carrying the above example further  under the leadership bullet  you could write  Joe is a natural leader  in my laboratories the other students turn to him for advice and can often be seen huddling around his desk asking for help  I have observed the manner in which he assists them  and rather than simply solving the problem for them he leads them through the Socratic process of asking pointed questions that help them solve their own problems  thus building their independence  Won t this take a lot of time to write for each professor  Absolutely  This is why so few students do it  and why it s actually fairly easy for a reviewer to take 100 applications and quickly cull them down to 3 or 4 that actually stand a chance  Think of it this way  if it takes an additional 4 hours per professor  and you have 3 references that you need for a  12 000 scholarship  it s a  1 000 an hour investment in time you are taking to do it right  It s hard to find a campus job that pays that well You won t get a great letter of recommendation by giving your professor the recommendation form and hoping for

school Selecting a graduate school There are over 120 schools in the United States alone that offer graduate degrees in Electrical Engineering  One easy way to help you narrow your choices is to first decide what kind of degree you want  Contrary to popular understanding  the degree following a B S  in engineering may be either of two types of Masters degrees  or you may proceed directly to a Ph D  Here are some questions that may help Do you want a Masters degree to work in industry  Perhaps you desire a consulting career with Anderson Consulting  you will then want what s often called an  Industrial Masters  These degree programs are course heavy  usually 10  research light  and focused on exposing you to practical skills and tools to let you hit the ground running on graduation  They typically take 12 18 months to complete and may or may not require a short  usually 6 month  thesis experience  Often there is an opportunity for a partial but not full tuition waiver if you agree to work as a teaching assistant  Not all universities offer this program  and those that do call it different things  call the graduate admissions office to find out  Do you think you want a PhD but want to get a Masters first  This will take longer than going straight for the PhD  but will keep your options open should you change your mind  This route will require what some universities call a  Science Masters  or a  Research Masters  These programs are course light  research heavy  and will prepare you for a career in engineering research  They typically take 24 30 months  always require a substantial thesis   and nearly always provide free tuition and a monthly stipend in return for teaching undergraduates  Once you begin a research project you may also compete for university or federal fellowships which also provide free tuition and a stipend  or receive research funding from your advisor  During the first few months you will interview with a variety of professors and select one whom you trust and is doing research you find fascinating  that professor will become your advisor  This is much more of a mentor apprenticeship learning experience than the industrial masters  Universities that do not offer a Ph D  will not have a science masters program  although universities that do may have only a science masters  e g  M I T  may have only an industrial masters  e g  Monmouth  or may have both  e g  Cornell  Do you know you want a doctorate  Perhaps you dream of returning to VMI as a professor  or want to perform cutting edge research in an R D laboratory  You will need a Ph D  to do these things  and you can earn one a few years faster by not obtaining a Masters degree first  Unlike many non engineering doctoral programs  you can expect full support during your doctoral program from a mixture of Teaching Assistantships  Research Assistantships  and fellowships  which will provide both tuition and a stipend  typically about 15k year  Universities structure PhD programs radically differently  some require a relatively heavy course load  some are entirely research focused  and the average length of time varies from a low of just over three years to a high of nearly eight  Some require a single doctoral qualification examination that s administered 6 months after arrival  some have a series of exams that continue for your first 3 years  The number of hurdles is often linked to prestige of the school Find out the details with a call to the graduate office before you apply and avoid unpleasant surprises Do you want a Masters degree to work
