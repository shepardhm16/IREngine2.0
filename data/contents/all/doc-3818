documentation unless accompanied by a current and complete evaluation    Beyond these nine elements needed for documentation  recommendations for accommodations  adaptive devices  assistive services  compensatory strategies  and or collateral support services will be considered on a case by case basis  Qualified professionals may refer to the Educational Testing Services Guidelines for Attention Deficit Disorder  Learning Disability  or Psychological Disability for more specific information regarding the documentation of a disability  Copies of each may be obtained from the ETS website www ets org  Guidelines for Documentation of a Specific Disability Learning Disability  Cadets with a learning disability are required to submit a comprehensive psychological and educational evaluation  Assessment  and any resulting diagnosis  must consist of and be based on a comprehensive assessment battery that does not rely on any one test or subtest  see general documentation guidelines  The ODS recognizes that once a person is diagnosed as having a qualified learning disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act  the disability is normally viewed as life long  Although the learning disability will continue  the academic impact may change in different educational settings  Therefore  documentation for learning disabilities should include current measures  within the past three to five years  using adult normed instruments  when appropriate  of the following  Aptitude   Cognitive Ability  e g  WAIS IV  Academic Achievement  e g  current levels of functioning in reading  mathematics  oral and written language  Information Processing  e g  short  long term  working memory  visual and auditory processing  executive functioning  A qualified professional must conduct the evaluation    Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  ADHD  Cadets with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  ADHD  are required to submit comprehensive documentation that substantiates the ADHD  This documentation should include evidence of   Early Impairment   Evidence of early impairment although it may not have been formally diagnosed and how symptoms manifested in more than one setting  relevant historical information is essential  Evidence of current impairment  Relevant testing information  see documentation guidelines  Interpretive summary based on a comprehensive evaluation   A qualified professional must conduct the evaluation  In the case of all disabilities  documentation must indicate that the disability substantially limits some major life activity  including learning  Those cadets who have been diagnosed with ADHD and are seeking medication from the Post Physician  must complete the Verification Form for Cadets with ADHD found through the Post Health Center  This documentation is required for medication purposes and is also a requirement for NCAA athletes currently taking stimulant medications  While this documentation is required for medication purposes  it is not substantial enough to fulfill documentation requirements for academic accommodations    Psychological Cadets with a psychological disability are provided accommodations and coordinated support services through the ODS  Support services and accommodations are determined by the individual diagnostic information submitted by the cadet  Because psychological disabilities can change over time  current diagnosis is critical for providing appropriate accommodations  Therefore  documentation may be required on a yearly basis  The following information will be needed   Qualifications of the Evaluator The documentation must include the following information and be typed on letterhead  dated  and signed  Names  titles  address and phone numbers of evaluator s  License certification  area of specialization  place of employment of evaluator s  Documentation for psychological disabilities should come from primary health care professionals  psychiatrists  psychologists  psychological nurses  and other appropriate licensed mental health professionals  The diagnosing professional may not be a relative  Diagnosis The documentation must include a clear statement of the individual s psychological condition  DSM V diagnosis with Axes I  II  and V  with a description of diagnostic tests  methods  and or criteria used  Evaluation and Treatment The documentation must give dates of evaluation or treatment  from   to    in order to establish the history of the condition and recency of the evaluation  must be within the last year  This should include specific results and the examiner s narrative interpretation  The evaluation should include treatments  medications  or assistive devices services currently prescribed or in use  In addition  please provide a description of the expected progression or stability of the impact of the disability over time  particularly the next five years  If this person has been referred for a complete battery of testing for learning disabilities or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to rule out any co morbidity  please provide a copy of the documentation and date completed  Accommodations The documentation should indicate how the individual s condition might affect him her in the academic college setting  The evaluation should list functional limitations experienced by the cadet  This is very helpful in choosing appropriate accommodations  NOTE  Beyond the four  4  elements needed for documentation  recommendations for accommodations  adaptive device  assistive services  compensatory strategies  and or collateral support services  i e  counseling  etc  will be considered within the context of the cadet s program  NOTE TO CADETS  Due to the nature of Psychological Disabilities  recency of documentation is critical for providing appropriate accommodations and support services  Depending on the disability  evaluations may need to be updated as often as every six  6  months  VMI
