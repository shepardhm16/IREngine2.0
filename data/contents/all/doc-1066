1950 A B  1955  1960 April 20 21  2015 Good evening  ladies and gentlemen  Welcome back to VMI and to this reunion celebration  Represented in this room tonight are graduates from two of the most critical decades in recent American history  the 1940s and the 1950s  These two decades experienced the greatest Global War in modern history and the height of what came to be called the  Cold War  These events gripped our nation for more than two decades and influenced almost every aspect of your lives  The period also saw remarkable social  scientific  and cultural developments that continue to shape our lives to this day  From the Classes of 1940 and 1945  members of which served in World War II  through the Classes of 1950 A B  and 1955  some of whom had served in World War II and others in Korea  to the Class of 1960  whose members served in Vietnam  you experienced challenges that tested the strength and resolve of our nation  Through your service   in the military and as civilians   you extended the contributions and enhanced the reputation of the Virginia Military Institute  VMI and the nation owe you a deep debt of thanks  Your years as cadets coincided with the administrations of three presidents  Franklin Delano Roosevelt  Harry S  Truman  and Dwight D  Eisenhower  You served under four superintendents  MG John A  Lejeune  LTG Charles E  Kilbourne  LTG Richard J  Marshall  and MG William H  Milton  Jr  And your classes served under seven commandants  COL Withers A  Burress  COL John M  Fray  COL Oliver B  Bucher  COL Frank R  Pancake  LTC Henry C  Kerlin  LTC Gilbert E  Butler  and COL Glover S  Johns  The time period represented by these classes can be sandwiched between two popular movies  The film Brother Rat  starring Ronald Reagan and released in 1937 while the Class of 1940 was still in Barracks  stands at one end  The film Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone and filmed at VMI in 1958  stands at the other end  The evolution of the Institute can be seen clearly in comparing those popular film productions  Also as a sign of the changing times  horses made their last appearance at VMI and the Institute built Mallory Hall  the physics building  as the world entered the nuclear age  The Class of 1940 matriculated 250 strong in September of 1937 and graduated 136 members in June 1940  The class entered while MG John A  Lejeune was Superintendent  but when he sustained a serious accident  he retired and was succeeded in 1938 by MG Charles E  Kilbourne  The Commandant was Major Withers A  Burress  There were two battalions  Six companies   A through F   containing infantry  cavalry  and artillery platoons  Horses were a prominent feature of the Corps  both at parades and on White s Farm  Barracks in those years consisted only of  Old Barracks  completed into a square  and old  Smith Hall  was located where New Barracks is now located  There were six academic departments and a military department  which only offered the Army ROTC program  Daily life at the Institute had not changed much for several decades  there were the frequent bugle calls  drills  classes  after taps escapades  and yelling in support of the Big Red Team  But all that was soon to change  The Class of 1940 was not officially the VMI  Centennial  class  but it was present on November 11th  1939  the day that marked the one hundredth anniversary of the founding of VMI  and heard the words of President Roosevelt by telephone hookup from The White House  He had been scheduled to be present at the Institute for that event  but he cancelled his visit as war broke out in Europe  In his transmitted address  the president said   The whole history of VMI is a triumphant chronicle of the part which the citizen soldier can play in a democracy  Almost immediately after the start of the war in Europe  the number of cadets enrolled steadily declined as the wartime Draft and enlistments drew its members into the Armed Forces  The class that entered a year later  the Class of 1945  matriculated 234 cadets  some records depict the number as 256  but by May of 1943  their brother rats had begun to depart two years early  By June of 1943  only 14 members of the class of 1945 were present for duty  Some brother rats returned later from the Army or as Army Specialized Training Cadets  but the number in the class continued to decline until there were only eleven cadets  mainly pre med cadets  four civil engineers  and one electrical engineer  When the normally scheduled graduation ceremony was held on 9 June 1945  only two members of the class remained  Cadet Captain F  T  Dresser and Cadet Captain M  P  Echols  Jr  Both were distinguished graduates  The entire Corps was eventually reduced to about 250 cadets  mainly Fourth Classmen who were too young for the Draft  Lieutenant General Charles E  Kilbourne  your tireless Superintendent in those momentous days  reported a shortage of rifles resulting from a requirement to turn in all serviceable weapons to the Army for use by the troops  so poorly prepared were we for the outbreak of war  VMI received some old Springfield rifles that had been declared  unfit for use by combat units  Moreover  there was a shortage of gray cloth for uniforms and even metal for badges  belt buckles  and other uniform items  General Kilbourne addressed this shortage by calling on alumni to send in coatees  shakos  breast and belt plates  and other items that they might have retained upon their graduation  From some source  he was able to obtain 24 swords for cadet officers  But times were tough  At the Final Ball in June 1945  there were not enough dress uniforms at the Institute  so uniforms had to be borrowed from Staunton Military Academy and Augusta Military Academy to outfit the 30 cadets who participated in the ball  Academic classes for VMI cadets at this time were accelerated so that what had taken four years to graduate now took two years and nine months  and a new class entered twice a year  Cadets had only one month off during the summer and ten days for Christmas  After the end of the war  many former cadets whose education had been interrupted by the war began returning to the Institute  At one time  there were seven classes in Barracks  1948A and B  1949A  B  and C  and 1950 A and B  these classes contained cadets  war veterans  and some commissioned officers  originally from the classes of 1944  1945  1946  and 1947  The presence of veterans  some commissioned officers  as members of the Corps led to the creation of Company G  a  home  for ex officers who were ineligible for ROTC  Returning veterans who were married were allowed to live in town  By the late 1940s  life at VMI had begun to  settle down  to its regular academic schedule  The Classes of 1950 A and 1950 B attended the Institute when it was operating under wartime conditions and finished just as life at the Institute was returning to normal  The Class of 1950 A was the last class to attend under the accelerated wartime program  matriculating 43 cadets on 4 March 1946  and by January 1950  the time you graduated  there were only 23 of you remaining in the Corps because of wartime demands  Your class was the last to enter under General Charles E  Kilbourne who  as superintendent emeritus  gave your graduation address  The Class of 1950 B matriculated 354 cadets in September 1946  the largest entering class in VMI history up to that time  Although your class included Brother Rats of a number of earlier classes  it was the first post war class to attend under the normal four year schedule  During your time  horses were eliminated from the military instruction program at the Institute  The horses remained at VMI for a couple of years  but units of mounted cadets participated in ceremonies only on a volunteer basis  In 1950  the old Riding Hall was converted into an indoor basketball court  later known as  The Pit  with an indoor track  One hundred and seventy six of you graduated in June of 1950  The superintendent at the time was General Richard J  Marshall  VMI s seventh superintendent  and your graduation speaker was General George C  Marshall  VMI  01  With overlapping classes  VMI must have been a complicated place for the administration and the Corps of Cadets  but no more baffling than for the Rats who entered at the time and faced two Third Classes  Before the war  plans had been made to expand the VMI Barracks  but wartime conditions caused a delay in those plans  In 1948  the plans were revived and  in preparation for construction  the old Library Building was torn down and a portion of the parade ground was lowered  Construction on New Barracks began immediately  and the facility opened one year later  when VMI opened its 111th session with 800 cadets in the Corps  The New Barracks were designed to accommodate an eventual corps of 1050  and it included administrative offices  and the Office of the Superintendent  Major change were also made to the Rat Line  Pressure had been mounting among the faculty  staff  alumni  and in the Virginia General Assembly to eliminate or significantly change the VMI Rat Line  Your class tackled the problem and  after much effort  the major defects were corrected and the entire class system was revamped  A year later  418 young men of the Class of 1955 signed the VMI Matriculation Book  making your class then the largest class in VMI history  About three months before you entered the Institute  Marshall Arch was dedicated in honor of General George C  Marshall  01  who was serving as Secretary of Defense at the time  General Marshall often visited VMI during your cadetship as he was elected President of the VMI Board of Visitors and Chairman of the Board of the VMI Foundation  Four years later  in 1955  232 of you graduated with VMI diplomas and  for many  commissions in the Armed Forces  During your cadetship  the Corps marched in the Presidential Inaugural Parade of General Eisenhower on 20 January 1953  700 cadets in two battalions  and in the rain in January 1954 for the Inaugural Parade of Governor Thomas B  Stanley  In your First Class year  the VMI Glee Club  under the direction of COL Herbert Nash  Dodo  Dillard  sang for President Eisenhower in Washington  and then formed an honor guard for the President as he was introduced to each cadet  On  Turkey Day  1953  VMI beat VPI by the score of 28 13 in Roanoke s Victory Stadium and won the Virginia Big 6 Football Championship  VMI had been picked to finish last by the sports writers  During your Rat year  there was the last major  Step Off  in recent history  Revisions to the Blue Book  made under COL Pancake s administration  led to an early Sunday morning protest in December 1951  The official history of VMI says that  Property was destroyed  windows  furniture  and lights were broken  and rooms flooded  When it was over  COL Pancake ordered the Corps to hike under full field equipment from 1 A M  to 4 A M  in what the newspapers referred to as  The Rebellion of Virginia Cadets  and what you called  the Midnight March  In addition to the full occupation of New Barracks  there were several other important physical changes to VMI during your cadetship  Mallory Hall was completed in 1952 and the renovation and extension of Scott Shipp Hall was begun  On the Parade ground  an old landmark that had been around since the very first days of the Institute finally disappeared in 1954  the VMI Guard Tree  an old hickory that was then just a stump  was cut down and replaced with a permanent monument  In September 1956  337 of you signed the VMI Matriculation Book as the Class of 1960  marking the beginning of VMI s 117th year  You may recall the uneasy freedom your class experienced during two weeks under no class system  In the Spring of your Rat Year  according to the Alumni Review   I quote   taking issue with an Institute order issued by MG William H  Milton  Jr  VMI Superintendent  which banned resurrections in the Corps and was designed to curb other abuses in barracks discipline  the upper three classes voted to drop the Rat Line  The result  for two weeks Rats strolled the stoops free of the Rat Line and all cadets exercised mutual class privileges  The Rat Line was restored on 9 April  May of 1957 saw a change in the  Spring Hike  as directed by COL Glover Johns  who became Commandant of Cades in the summer of 1957  The  hike  became a four day field training exercise considerably more strenuous than Spring hikes of prior years  In the fall of 1957  during your Third Class Year  the Big Red Team went undefeated with 9 victories and one tie  The record represented the first undefeated season for VMI in 37 years  In compiling this record  the Keydets captured the Big Six Championship of Virginia and their first undisputed Southern Conference Championship  and at one point in the season were ranked 13th nationally by the Associated Press  At the start of your Second Class year  1958 1959   the barracks population rose to 1030  near to its capacity of 1038  This marked the largest Cadet Corps in VMI history and the first time enrollment exceeded 1000  As you entered your First Class year  1959 1960  General Milton and Colonel Johns announced that they would retire at Finals  A new Superintendent was selected  Marine General George R  E  Shell  VMI s ninth superintendent in its 120 year history  And a new Commandant was selected  LTC Jeffrey G  Smith  At graduation  177 members of your class received diplomas  The future looked bright  A new  young president was about to be elected  A new decade was about to begin  But hidden from most was the rising specter of war in Southeast Asia and the beginning of a transformative and at time violent decade that would change the nation  As I prepared my remarks this evening  I had initially intended to mention several of your classmates and their significant contributions to VMI and to the nation  Frankly  the numbers are far too many  Your classes include former Board of Visitors members  a Superintendent  trustees of alumni agencies  staff and instructors here  highly decorated war veterans   many honored in this Hall of Valor   academic and corporate leaders  and significant donors to the Institute  Your record of service to the nation has been superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting outstanding men and women to its faculty and staff  and today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South has been a solid home for VMI athletics for the past ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of the past nine years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We have been fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who takes the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job over many years for the Institute  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally and individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national boxing collegiate championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  a  19 6 full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  as  Maury Brooke Hall  We have secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the relocation of the Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from 12 496 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and continuing education for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Best wishes for a rewarding and enjoyable reunion and please
