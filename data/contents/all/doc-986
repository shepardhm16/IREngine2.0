Upon our arrival  we presented a check of over  7 000 to the organization  And for this group  made up of juniors and seniors  to spend their Spring Break in a third world country rather than on a cruise ship is commendable  I am so proud to have had the opportunity to work alongside the cadets on this trip  I know the trips to come will be just as impactful and will surely show Zanmi Beni the good that VMI has to give  Carrie Worttham April 17  2012 at 12 03 pm   Reply Carrie Worttham April 17  2012 at 12 03 pm   Reply April 17  2012 at 12 03 pm Reply As I had been to Haiti a year ago  I was prepared for the stark reality of an earthquake devastated country and the overwhelming poverty  The greatest challenge for me was coming to terms with my small capacity to give back  I was reminded by just how much need there is in Haiti  At times I was discouraged by how small an impact I was making or could make  But I was also reminded that just one person can make a difference  What the VMI team and the people of Zanmi Beni showed me was that no matter what the odds  there is always reason to give back  or at least try  From the beginning  the team demonstrated what it means to truly care about a cause  Along with homework  military duties  and athletics  most of the cadets went out of their way to find time to raise money for Foundation Manmo  the nonprofit we committed to serve  Upon our arrival  we presented a check of over  7 000 to the organization  And for this group  made up of juniors and seniors  to spend their Spring Break in a third world country rather than
