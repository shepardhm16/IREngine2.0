association of primarily collegiate members and chapters whose purposes are to encourage and recognize superior scholarship and or leadership achievement either in broad fields of education or in departmental fields at either undergraduate or graduate levels The honor society has followed the expansion and specialization of higher education in America  When Phi Beta Kappa was organized in 1776 no thought was given to its proper field  since all colleges then in existence were for the training of men for  the service of the church and the state  With the expansion of education into new fields  a choice had to be made  and the society elected to operate in the field of the liberal arts and sciences  Although this was not finally voted until 1898  the trend was evident years earlier  and 1885 saw the establishment of Tau Beta Pi Tau Beta Pi is the only engineering honor society representing the entire engineering profession  It is the nation s second oldest honor society  founded
