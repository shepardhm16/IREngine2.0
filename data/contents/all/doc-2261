structure in the Rio Negro  Amazonas  Brazil  I recently embarked upon a long term research project in the Brazilian Amazon in conjunction with Dr  Carlos Freitas at the Federal University of the Amazon  UFAM  in Brazil  As one of the world s most unique and fragile ecosystems  the seasonally changing tropical rainforest Amazon River is facing the combined deadly threats of deforestation  agricultural development  and global climate change  The predicted changes as a result of these threats will likely have dire effects on the huge diversity of resident fish species important for the ecosystem  native subsistence communities  and cultural value  The Rio Negro  blackwater river  is a huge mineral poor and acidic  pH  3 9 4 2  river  the second largest contributor of freshwater to the central Amazon  and home to 800 900 different species of fish  We are embarking upon critical research to both establish current trends in species dynamics of these fish  as well as predict how these patterns may change over time  Current classifications of trophic guild are rudimentary at best  and based on either little biological data or information extrapolated from white water  alkaline neutral pH  rivers  In particular  the established understanding of something as fundamental as the source identity of the food web base in this uniquely acidic environment is still in question We have designed and are now pursuing a robust experiment to identify  once and for all  the food web base in the Rio Negro    Arthropod Predator Trophic Dynamics  Top predators in arthropod assemblages  such as Praying Mantids  can exert a controlling influence on biodiversity by virtue of what is known as top down trophic cascades that extend all the way down to the primary producers in an ecosystem  Since most animal species on earth are arthropods  these systems are appropriate models for studying the general properties of ecosystem trophic interactions  While it is known from captive studies that mantids are tritrophic predators  able to survive on three distinct known diets  herbivores  carnivores  and plant material  the degree to which these different strategies occur in nature has yet to be determined  Since the summer of 2012 I have been pursuing research to help decipher the important relationships these predators have with species on other trophic levels  thus determining both their influence on current food web structures as well as their true behavioral plasticity in the face of global climate change  In collaboration with Dr  Larry Hurd  Washington   Lee University  I have been working to explore the trophic dynamics of praying mantids using stable isotope analyses  Analysis of the Carbon  Nitrogen  Oxygen  and Hydrogen isotope ratios in field collected mantids from Virginia are being compared to mantids raised in the laboratory on three distinct known diets  A  grasshoppers and moths  herbivores  B  spiders and wasps  carnivores  and C  pollen  plant material  to find out the relative importance of these different trophic levels in the diet of these generalist predators during different stages of their life cycle  This research will finally give us insight into some key life history characteristics  1  Exactly which components of the food web are most important or essential for Mantid survival in the wild  2  Determining the influence of Mantids on the trophic dynamics and structure of local ecosystems  and 3  highlight any inter  and intra species variations in foraging strategy    Coyote Foraging Ecology  The coyote  Canis latrans  has increased in population throughout the east coast of North America  especially in the recent decade and particularly in Virginia  As a consequence of this range expansion  human coyote interactions have increased  both directly through preying on livestock and indirectly through resource competition with local hunters  Effective management of these interactions in multiple habitat interfaces can be significantly enhanced by broadening the scientific understanding of both the basic foraging ecology of the coyote  as well as the specific diet of the species in Virginia  Since Spring of 2010  I have been examining the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signature from the hairs of wild coyotes and potential prey  livestock  wild mammals  and domesticated pets  throughout Appalachia in forest  agricultural  and urban habitats in order to investigate the specific trophic role of the coyote in this ecosystem  I am currently obtaining samples from wild coyotes through noninvasive hair traps  as well as through cooperative agreements with educational  governmental  and private entities and landowners  To more precisely pinpoint which prey are utilized by coyotes in which habitats  I am incorporating delta15N and delta13C signatures from my samples into isotopic mixing models  and comparing proposed diets geographically between multiple habitats  Macroinvertebrate diversity in Appalachian Streams This research endeavor is investigating the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and trophic structure across aquatic ecosystems  Through the survey and collection of freshwater invertebrates  I am examining the population structure of native organisms in comparison to the environment in which they reside to establish a dynamic model of trophic structure  This work will provide essential baseline knowledge into the passage of nutrients through local ecosystems  as well as yield specific insight on the impacts of climate change on Virginia s mountain ecosystems that will increase the state s ability to adapt and prepare for these changes  In addition  the results of this effort will aid the Virginia Save Our Streams and Maury

field  learn the intricacies of environmental sampling  and further develop laboratory skills     Marine Mammal Population Dynamics    Ever since my first bit of graduate studies at Woods Hole through Boston University and the Marine Biology Laboratory  I have been interested in the population biology and physiology of marine mammals  As critical components of the marine ecosystem  marine mammals are often both keystone species and  canaries in the coalmine  for the effects of global climate change on our dynamic ecosystems  I started my scientific endeavors in this field by exploring the Population biology of Harbor  Phoca vitulina concolor  and Gray seals  Halichoerus grypus  in Southern New England in conjunction with work through the National Marine Fisheries Service  NEFSC  I then continued my exploration of marine mammals through an examination of Bowhead whale  Balaena mysticetus  migratory patterns and Steller sea lion  Eumetopias jubatus  feeding patterns using stable isotope analyses at the University of Alaska Fairbanks  There  I examined seasonal and multi year migratory patterns of the Bowhead whale through an analysis of Oxygen and Hydrogen isotopes in the baleen of harvested whales  Connected with that project  I investigated the way in which O   H are passed through multiple trophic levels in a marine food web  from water up to whale  Additionally  I explored the historical ecology of Steller sea lions through changes in diet recorded in individuals  growth layers in teeth  and throughout the population  bone samples  Since 2007 I have been exploring further population dynamics of marine mammals through a field course in New Brunswick  Canada and in conjunction with the Huntsman Marine Science Centre there  With the assistance of students from throughout Ontario  I am collecting a long term dataset on Harbor and Gray seal population dynamics in the Passamaquoddy Bay region    Lt  Col  Pieter deHart Home Courses Office Hours

issues relating to global climate change  I focus on ecological sampling techniques equally wide ranging  from population assessments through photo identification of individuals to stable isotope analyses of keratinous tissues and collagen  Please read below for further description of a few more specific areas of recent interest  Trophic structure in the Rio Negro  Amazonas  Brazil  I recently embarked upon a long term research project in the Brazilian Amazon in conjunction with Dr  Carlos Freitas at the Federal University of the Amazon  UFAM  in Brazil  As one of the world s most unique and fragile ecosystems  the seasonally changing tropical rainforest Amazon River is facing the combined deadly threats of deforestation  agricultural development  and global climate change  The predicted changes as a result of these threats will likely have dire effects on the huge diversity of resident fish species important for the ecosystem  native subsistence communities  and cultural value  The Rio Negro  blackwater river  is a huge mineral poor and acidic  pH  3 9 4 2  river  the second largest contributor of freshwater to the central Amazon  and home to 800 900 different species of fish  We are embarking upon critical research to both establish current trends in species dynamics of these fish  as well as predict how these patterns may change over time  Current classifications of trophic guild are rudimentary at best  and based on either little biological data or information extrapolated from white water  alkaline neutral pH  rivers  In particular  the established understanding of something as fundamental as the source identity of the food web base in this uniquely acidic environment is still in question We have designed and are now pursuing a robust experiment to identify  once and for all  the food web base in the Rio Negro    Arthropod Predator Trophic Dynamics  Top predators in arthropod assemblages  such as Praying Mantids  can exert a controlling influence on biodiversity by virtue of what is known as top down trophic cascades that extend all the way down to the primary producers in an ecosystem  Since most animal species on earth are arthropods  these systems are appropriate models for studying the general properties of ecosystem trophic interactions  While it is known from captive studies that mantids are tritrophic predators  able to survive on three distinct known diets  herbivores  carnivores  and plant material  the degree to which these different strategies occur in nature has yet to be determined  Since the summer of 2012 I have been pursuing research to help decipher the important relationships these predators have with species on other trophic levels  thus determining both their influence on current food web structures as well as their true behavioral plasticity in the face of global climate change  In collaboration with Dr  Larry Hurd  Washington   Lee University  I have been working to explore the trophic dynamics of praying mantids using stable isotope analyses  Analysis of the Carbon  Nitrogen  Oxygen  and Hydrogen isotope ratios in field collected mantids from Virginia are being compared to mantids raised in the laboratory on three distinct known diets  A  grasshoppers and moths  herbivores  B  spiders and wasps  carnivores  and C  pollen  plant material  to find out the relative importance of these different trophic levels in the diet of these generalist predators during different stages of their life cycle  This research will finally give us insight into some key life history characteristics  1  Exactly which components of the food web are most important or essential for Mantid survival in the wild  2  Determining the influence of Mantids on the trophic dynamics and structure of local ecosystems  and 3  highlight any inter  and intra species variations in foraging strategy    Coyote Foraging Ecology  The coyote  Canis latrans  has increased in population throughout the east coast of North America  especially in the recent decade and particularly in Virginia  As a consequence of this range expansion  human coyote interactions have increased  both directly through preying on livestock and indirectly through resource competition with local hunters  Effective management of these interactions in multiple habitat interfaces can be significantly enhanced by broadening the scientific understanding of both the basic foraging ecology of the coyote  as well as the specific diet of the species in Virginia  Since Spring of 2010  I have been examining the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signature from the hairs of wild coyotes and potential prey  livestock  wild mammals  and domesticated pets  throughout Appalachia in forest  agricultural  and urban habitats in order to investigate the specific trophic role of the coyote in this ecosystem  I am currently obtaining samples from wild coyotes through noninvasive hair traps  as well as through cooperative agreements with educational  governmental  and private entities and landowners  To more precisely pinpoint which prey are utilized by coyotes in which habitats  I am incorporating delta15N and delta13C signatures from my samples into isotopic mixing models  and comparing proposed diets geographically between multiple habitats  Macroinvertebrate diversity in Appalachian Streams This research endeavor is investigating the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and trophic structure across aquatic ecosystems  Through the survey and collection of freshwater invertebrates  I am examining the population structure of native organisms in comparison to the environment in which they reside to establish a dynamic model of trophic structure  This work will provide essential baseline knowledge into the passage of nutrients through local ecosystems  as well as yield specific insight on the impacts of climate change on Virginia s mountain ecosystems that will increase the state s ability to adapt and prepare for these changes  In addition  the results of this effort will aid the Virginia Save Our Streams and Maury River Watershed Monitors program in their long term monitoring efforts through data sharing and feedback on sampling techniques  This research is also incorporated into coursework  as it is supported by both independent research cadets and students in my Aquatic Ecosystems course  This project provides cadets interested in ecology and conservation biology an opportunity to work hands on in the field  learn the intricacies of environmental sampling  and further develop laboratory skills     Marine Mammal Population Dynamics    Ever since my first bit of graduate studies at Woods Hole through Boston University and the

Boston University and the Marine Biology Laboratory  I have been interested in the population biology and physiology of marine mammals  As critical components of the marine ecosystem  marine mammals are often both keystone species and  canaries in the coalmine  for the effects of global climate change on our dynamic ecosystems  I started my scientific endeavors in this field by exploring the Population biology of Harbor  Phoca vitulina concolor  and Gray seals  Halichoerus grypus  in Southern New England in conjunction with work through the National Marine Fisheries Service  NEFSC  I then continued my exploration of marine mammals through an examination of Bowhead whale  Balaena mysticetus  migratory patterns and Steller sea lion  Eumetopias jubatus  feeding patterns using stable isotope analyses at the University of Alaska Fairbanks  There  I examined seasonal and multi year migratory patterns of the Bowhead whale through an analysis of Oxygen and Hydrogen isotopes in the baleen of harvested whales  Connected with that project  I investigated the way in which O   H are passed through multiple trophic levels in a marine food web  from water up to whale  Additionally  I explored the historical ecology of Steller sea lions through changes in diet recorded in individuals  growth layers in teeth  and throughout the population  bone samples  Since 2007 I have been exploring further population dynamics of marine mammals through a field course in New Brunswick  Canada and in conjunction with the Huntsman Marine Science Centre there  With the assistance of students from throughout Ontario  I am collecting a long term dataset on Harbor and Gray seal population dynamics in the Passamaquoddy Bay region    Lt  Col  Pieter deHart Home Courses Office Hours

project in the Brazilian Amazon in conjunction with Dr  Carlos Freitas at the Federal University of the Amazon  UFAM  in Brazil  As one of the world s most unique and fragile ecosystems  the seasonally changing tropical rainforest Amazon River is facing the combined deadly threats of deforestation  agricultural development  and global climate change  The predicted changes as a result of these threats will likely have dire effects on the huge diversity of resident fish species important for the ecosystem  native subsistence communities  and cultural value  The Rio Negro  blackwater river  is a huge mineral poor and acidic  pH  3 9 4 2  river  the second largest contributor of freshwater to the central Amazon  and home to 800 900 different species of fish  We are embarking upon critical research to both establish current trends in species dynamics of these fish  as well as predict how these patterns may change over time  Current classifications of trophic guild are rudimentary at best  and based on either little biological data or information extrapolated from white water  alkaline neutral pH  rivers  In particular  the established understanding of something as fundamental as the source identity of the food web base in this uniquely acidic environment is still in question We have designed and are now pursuing a robust experiment to identify  once and for all  the food web base in the Rio Negro    Arthropod Predator Trophic Dynamics  Top predators in arthropod assemblages  such as Praying Mantids  can exert a controlling influence on biodiversity by virtue of what is known as top down trophic cascades that extend all the way down to the primary producers in an ecosystem  Since most animal species on earth are arthropods  these systems are appropriate models for studying the general properties of ecosystem trophic interactions  While it is known from captive studies that mantids are tritrophic predators  able to survive on three distinct known diets  herbivores  carnivores  and plant material  the degree to which these different strategies occur in nature has yet to be determined  Since the summer of 2012 I have been pursuing research to help decipher the important relationships these predators have with species on other trophic levels  thus determining both their influence on current food web structures as well as their true behavioral plasticity in the face of global climate change  In collaboration with Dr  Larry Hurd  Washington   Lee University  I have been working to explore the trophic dynamics of praying mantids using stable isotope analyses  Analysis of the Carbon  Nitrogen  Oxygen  and Hydrogen isotope ratios in field collected mantids from Virginia are being compared to mantids raised in the laboratory on three distinct known diets  A  grasshoppers and moths  herbivores  B  spiders and wasps  carnivores  and C  pollen  plant material  to find out the relative importance of these different trophic levels in the diet of these generalist predators during different stages of their life cycle  This research will finally give us insight into some key life history characteristics  1  Exactly which components of the food web are most important or essential for Mantid survival in the wild  2  Determining the influence of Mantids on the trophic dynamics and structure of local ecosystems  and 3  highlight any inter  and intra species variations in foraging strategy    Coyote Foraging Ecology  The coyote  Canis latrans  has increased in population throughout the east coast of North America  especially in the recent decade and particularly in Virginia  As a consequence of this range expansion  human coyote interactions have increased  both directly through preying on livestock and indirectly through resource competition with local hunters  Effective management of these interactions in multiple habitat interfaces can be significantly enhanced by broadening the scientific understanding of both the basic foraging ecology of the coyote  as well as the specific diet of the species in Virginia  Since Spring of 2010  I have been examining the carbon and nitrogen isotopic signature from the hairs of wild coyotes and potential prey  livestock  wild mammals  and domesticated pets  throughout Appalachia in forest  agricultural  and urban habitats in order to investigate the specific trophic role of the coyote in this ecosystem  I am currently obtaining samples from wild coyotes through noninvasive hair traps  as well as through cooperative agreements with educational  governmental  and private entities and landowners  To more precisely pinpoint which prey are utilized by coyotes in which habitats  I am incorporating delta15N and delta13C signatures from my samples into isotopic mixing models  and comparing proposed diets geographically between multiple habitats  Macroinvertebrate diversity in Appalachian Streams This research endeavor is investigating the impacts of environmental change on biodiversity and trophic structure across aquatic ecosystems  Through the survey and collection of freshwater invertebrates  I am examining the population structure
