Institute 303 Shell Hall Lexington  VA  24450 Academic Advising Academic Advising The mission of the Institute Academic Advising Program is to guide cadets through the exploration and clarification of their academic  career and life goals to help them develop skills and strategies that will contribute to their academic success and enable them to achieve a balanced engagement in co curricular and academic activities  Faculty advisors both support and challenge cadets in an effort to increase each cadet s confidence and self sufficiency until graduation  Upon entry into VMI  each cadet is assigned a faculty advisor who  unless the cadet subsequently changes academic major  will work with the cadet until graduation  During the first year there is extensive contact between the advisor and cadet in order to facilitate the cadet s transition into the VMI culture  assist the cadet in mastering the academic policies and regulations  and assist the cadet in coordinating the demands of a multi faceted academic and co curricular experience  As cadets advance through their cadetship  they are expected to assume increased responsibility for complying with academic standards and regulations  initiating the use of support services  and making good decisions about the integration of the academic and co curricular activities  The academic advising program is a pivotal element of the broader program of academic support services provided by the Virginia Military Institute and a major force in ensuring a successful progression through the VMI program  Cadets are encouraged to take full advantage of the Institute s commitment to the academic advising process   VMI Academic Advising  Insight for Incoming Cadets  Vision  The Academic Advising Program at VMI  aspires to produce cadets who are committed to pursuing their intellectual goals and who are actively engaged in the process of achieving those goals  It aspires to produce cadets who are actively engaged in planning  implementing and completing their academic careers with mentoring and guidance from faculty advisors  strives to create faculty advisors who are committed to serving the academic program goals by mentoring cadets  Each faculty advisor should be dedicated to the welfare of his or her advisees and to be someone to whom the cadet may go  at any time during the cadetship  for guidance on any aspect of VMI or career choices  seeks to form a partnership between the cadet and the faculty advisor in which the cadet assumes an increasingly more active role in academic decisions as she or he progresses through his her cadetship  The vision is consistent with the academic program vision because it emphasizes developing the whole cadet through engagement in academic and co curricular activities as well as faculty development and mentorship  The National Academic Advising Association Core Values Exposition   VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES
