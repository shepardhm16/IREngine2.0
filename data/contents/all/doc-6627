that not only sharpened their engineering skills  but also allowed them to serve the local community and gave them a head start on spreading holiday cheer  Under the direction of Col  Grigg Mullen Jr   76  professor of civil engineering  about 10 cadets joined 20 25 civilians to cut and raise a frame for a 10  by 16 foot shed  The shed was auctioned off to benefit Project Horizon at the group s annual Deck the Halls event Nov  22  Project Horizon is an organization that assists victims of domestic abuse in Rockbridge County   Col  Mullen and the cadets at VMI do something for us almost every year  said Judy Casteele  executive director of Project Horizon   It gives cadets an opportunity to do something with engineering as well as help our organization  We are very excited about the continued partnership  Mullen said the partnership with Project Horizon goes back to 1999  when cadets  along with Washington and Lee University students and other timber framers  constructed what became Lisa s House  the organization s domestic violence shelter  At the time  timber framing was a novel concept to cadets  but since then the skills needed for such projects have been passed down from year to year   Over Fall FTX  we had 12 civilian students who were paying through the Timber Framers Guild   to learn the basics of timber framing  said Mullen   which means we ve come full circle because when we did the first project  none of the cadets knew anything about timber framing  and we hired timber framing guild members as instructors    Now we re helping to teach novice timber framers  Though the basic plans for the buildings are usually from outside sources  cadets make adjustments to the design and figure out all the joinery  The most valuable part of the experience comes once the construction process begins  however   When you teach engineering students and you draw up the plans  somehow they have to become reality  and that never quite goes the way you plan    In the transition from a design on paper to a completed project  there are quality control issues and communication issues  Mullen explained   In addition to the construction process  they also get leadership experience  making sure everything happens in an appropriate manner  When it comes to assembly  we re lifting heavy pieces where somebody gets hurt if you do it wrong  and so they learn appropriate safety procedures and how to safely control a group of people engaged in heavy work   Every time we build a new frame  I learn something new  said Cadet Christopher Gray  15  who with Alex Palagyi  15 serves as cadet in charge of timber framing   Guidance from experts allows cadets and workshop attendees to strengthen their skills in order to perform more efficiently on the next frame we build  Gray also acknowledged the opportunity the project gave cadets to serve the local community   It s a true win win situation  As a cadet  the opportunities for community service during the school year are small due to academic and military demands  This allows cadets to get involved in the community as well as make themselves better  not only in the timber framing aspect  but

Fundraiser Project Supports Holiday Fundraiser During Fall FTX Oct  3 5  a group of cadets completed a timber framing project that not only sharpened their engineering skills  but also allowed them to serve the local community and gave them a head start on spreading holiday cheer  Under the direction of Col  Grigg Mullen Jr   76  professor of civil engineering  about 10 cadets joined 20 25 civilians to cut and raise a frame for a 10  by 16 foot shed  The shed was auctioned off to benefit Project Horizon at the group s annual Deck the Halls event Nov  22  Project Horizon is an organization that assists victims of domestic abuse in Rockbridge County   Col  Mullen and the cadets at VMI do something for us almost every year  said Judy Casteele  executive director of Project Horizon   It gives cadets an opportunity to do something with engineering as well as help our organization  We are very excited about the continued partnership  Mullen said the partnership with Project Horizon goes back to 1999  when cadets  along with Washington and Lee University students and other timber framers  constructed what became Lisa s House  the organization s domestic violence shelter  At the time  timber framing was a novel concept to cadets  but since then the skills needed for such projects have been passed down from year to year   Over Fall FTX  we had 12 civilian students who were paying through the Timber Framers Guild   to learn the basics of timber framing  said Mullen   which means we ve come full circle because when we did the first project  none of the cadets knew anything about timber framing  and we hired timber framing guild members as instructors    Now we re helping to teach novice timber framers  Though the basic plans for the buildings are usually from outside sources  cadets make adjustments to the design and figure out all the joinery  The most valuable part of the experience comes once the construction process begins  however   When you teach engineering students and you draw up the plans  somehow they have to become reality  and that never quite goes the way you plan    In the transition from a design on paper to a completed project  there are quality control issues and communication issues  Mullen explained   In addition to the construction process  they also get leadership experience  making sure everything happens in an appropriate manner  When it comes to assembly  we re lifting heavy pieces where somebody gets hurt if you do it wrong  and so they learn appropriate safety procedures and how to safely control a group of people engaged in heavy work   Every time we build a new frame  I learn something new  said Cadet Christopher Gray  15  who with Alex Palagyi  15 serves as cadet in charge of timber framing   Guidance from experts allows cadets and workshop attendees to strengthen their skills in order to perform more efficiently on the next frame we build  Gray also acknowledged the opportunity the project gave cadets to serve the local community   It s a true win win situation  As a cadet  the opportunities for community service during the school year are small due to academic and military demands  This allows cadets to get involved in the community as well as make themselves better  not only in the timber framing aspect  but in forming the well rounded citizen soldier that VMI is
