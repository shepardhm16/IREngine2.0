Audiology Hearing Impairment Simulator by G  Will Flathers  08  It is estimated that up to 6 newborns per 1000 are born with congenital hearing loss  The purpose of this project is to assist the parents of these children by developing computer software that simulates the patient s hearing for parent  patient education and reassurance  In conjuncture with Dr  James Squire Ph D  and Dr  Roger Ruth M D  I have created an interactive computer program that is designed to be easy to use  widely distributed to the general public  and give parents a tool to help them understand children that have common hearing impairments  Parents  when armed with a greater  more experiential understanding of how the world sounds to their children  will be able to confidently raise and teach them  Users may record short sound clips onto the computer or select provided samples such as music  sirens  and voice  The program then uses the results of a standard audiogram from infant screening tests and any other audiologist s data to create a personalized audio output that constructs what the patient actually hears  In addition to the primary goal of parent  patient education  other possible benefits of the program include increased safety for hearing impaired children  improved teacher interaction with these children  and potential academic use as a teaching aid for medical students  The Hearing Impairment Simulator was presented at the 2006 National Conference of Undergraduate Research and VMI s Undergraduate Research Symposium  where it won second place in the poster competition
