semester during their cadetship   Summer programs do not count  Cadets cannot be on ACPRO or CONPRO to be approved for study abroad  VMI does not authorize study abroad or visits to countries that are under a State Department warning The current warning list at www travel state gov  Financial Concerns  The average cost of a semester abroad is  12 000 and varies significantly by location  There are a number of ways to help offset these costs  Military Exchanges   VMI has direct exchanges with St  Cyr  the French Military Academy  the Bundeswehr University in Hamburg  Germany  L Ecole Polytechnique  the Military Academy of Lithuania  Zrinyi Miklos National Defense University in Hungary  and Salford University in the United Kingdom  When cadets participate in one of these programs  they pay approximately what they would pay to attend VMI  plus airfare  Scholarships   VMI has a number of scholarships available  Check our scholarship web page for detailed information  Additionally  all cadets studying through third party providers are strongly encouraged to apply for a scholarship from the provider  A large percentage of applicants receive awards  Spending money   Before your son or daughter leaves the United States  discuss with them how they are going to access money  In most cases  an ATM or credit card is the most efficient way to get funds in the local currency at the best rate  It is important that cadets ask their banks in advance what fees there are for overseas transactions and if those can be waived while abroad  Also notify the bank before going overseas to prevent ATM or credit card accounts from being  frozen  Health  Health Insurance   All cadets studying abroad must certify that their health insurance will cover them while abroad or purchase a student policy that will provide coverage  Our office has information about several providers of study abroad health insurance  The Center for Disease Control website has country specific health information  Communication  Discuss in advance how you plan to communicate with your son or daughter while he or she is abroad  Also discuss when and how often you expect to hear from them  While most cadets have access to internet service while they are abroad  it may not be available immediately upon arrival in the host country  An international calling card or an international cell phone may be easier  There are also internet phone options that are very inexpensive  Checklist for action by you and or your cadet  Apply for passport or passport renewal well in advance  Passports can take 6 8 weeks to process  Check with the consulate of the host country and be aware of visa requirements  Make flight arrangements as soon as your cadet has been accepted and has the dates of the program  Be sure that at least one parent holds a valid passport in case of emergency  Keep photocopies of your son or daughter s important documents and contact information  including Social Security card  passport  and foreign address  Be sure that your cadet has signed a Release of Information Form so that our office can give you information while he or she is abroad  Be prepared to deal with the culture shock and reverse culture shock that your son or daughter may face  Make sure that your cadet has completed all relevant financial aid paperwork  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
