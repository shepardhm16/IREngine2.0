Research Confocal Microscope Advances Cadet Cardiovascular Research Researchers at VMI are working towards uncovering the secrets of blood vessel development and maintenance using a state of the art confocal microscope located at Washington and Lee University  Cadet Fritz Dawson  13 is examining the role that estrogen plays in blood vessel development and  in a related project  Cadet Pete VanSteyn  13 is looking into the importance of nitric oxide in blood vessel development  Both cadets are using developing zebrafish  which are prime candidates for study for many reasons  including the fact that they have relatively simple and regular blood vessel patterns   Why would anyone be working with a fish  some ask   when you re interested in the human heart and blood vessels  said Col  Jim Turner  65  head of VMI s biology department and mentor for the cadet research projects  Turner explained that what is learned from studying zebrafish blood vessels should be applicable to human blood vessels   The belief is that estrogen plays a key role in micro concentrations in both blood vessel development and blood vessel maintenance  said Dawson   We use the zebrafish for a few reasons  They grow really fast  they re transparent so we can see their blood vessels and internal anatomy  and they can internalize chemical solutions through their skin very quickly  Researchers at VMI are working with a type of zebrafish that has been genetically altered to optimize their usefulness in blood vessel research   They have a jellyfish protein gene inserted into their DNA  so that makes their developing blood vessels glow bright green when they re hit with a certain wavelength of light  said Dawson   When you look at them normally they just look like a normal fish  but when they re hit with the laser  all of a sudden you see all of their blood vessels light up  Dawson worked with three groups of zebrafish  a control group  a group that received an estrogen supplement  and a group that was treated with an aromatase inhibitor  which made the fish unable to produce estrogen   What we found is that when estrogen was restricted  the blood vessels would all deteriorate  You can see a significant difference in the normal blood vessel structure  It looks like someone went in there with a weed whacker and cut all these gaps  said Dawson   The fish that received the estrogen supplement showed increased angiogenesis  or blood vessel growth  Just noticing that the blood vessels were deteriorating wasn t enough  Dawson had to find a way to precisely quantify the levels of deterioration to produce a usable set of data   With his creativity and imagination  he was the first person to find a way to get some quantitative data on the development of blood vessels  said Turner   He does that so precisely that his data has already shown a significant difference in the treatment types  Among the factors that Dawson considers are numbers of gaps and the thickness of blood vessels  To do that he needs an image that shows all the blood vessels isolated and in focus  That s what the confocal microscope makes possible   We have the technology here at VMI to view the blood vessels in real time  but what the equipment at W L allows us to do is take a z stack  which is a stack of images taken of different focal points to produce a composite image  said Dawson   So by doing that you can see all the blood vessels at once and quantify the level of blood vessel development  Dawson is currently working on an Institute Honors thesis on his research  and a manuscript has been accepted by the refereed journal General and Comparative Endocrinology  Dawson was one of 10 undergraduates contributing to the paper   Estrogen Prevents Cardiac and Vascular Failure in the  Listless  Zebrafish Developmental Model   Pete VanSteyn wanted to dig deeper into the process that s going on here  said Turner   We know that estrogen has a direct effect on the synthesis of a unique molecule called nitric oxide   Nitric oxide has powerful influences on the cardiovascular system  said Turner   VanSteyn s results this summer indicated that you can treat the fish with nitric oxide inhibitors and get the same or even more pronounced results than Fritz saw with the estrogen inhibitors  and if you add estrogen back  then you get recovery  This line of research is likely to be picked up by cadet researchers for years to come   We re trolling down the possible pathway for an actual mechanism  and we think we re getting very close with the nitric oxide paradigm  said Turner   Then we can go further into the cell and see what nitric oxide is actually doing  The research is another example of VMI cadets making real contributions to scientific discourse   No one can tell you that undergraduates can t do high end science work and can t be trusted with equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars  said Turner   They can  and they do  I ve had the pleasure and the honor to include all the undergraduates that I work with on my scientific publications as co authors because they all add important bits and pieces to the overall project  That high end science work is possible  in part  because of the equipment available to cadets   The quality of the equipment we have here is just as good as what you would find in a research lab at a large university  said Turner   Our philosophy is that we have this nice equipment and we re certainly not going to keep the cadets from it  The confocal microscope was acquired last year through a  366 000 National Science Foundation grant  VMI professors were among those who contributed project descriptions to the proposal for that grant  according to W L   We have this wonderful scope that was set up last year at Washington and Lee due to the collaboration of faculty members at both institutions  said Turner   You can imagine how convenient it is for cadets who have a restricted lifestyle just to walk a block

has been accepted by the refereed journal General and Comparative Endocrinology  Dawson was one of 10 undergraduates contributing to the paper   Estrogen Prevents Cardiac and Vascular Failure in the  Listless  Zebrafish Developmental Model   Pete VanSteyn wanted to dig deeper into the process that s going on here  said Turner   We know that estrogen has a direct effect on the synthesis of a unique molecule called nitric oxide   Nitric oxide has powerful influences on the cardiovascular system  said Turner   VanSteyn s results this summer indicated that you can treat the fish with nitric oxide inhibitors and get the same or even more pronounced results than Fritz saw with the estrogen inhibitors  and if you add estrogen back  then you get recovery  This line of research is likely to be picked up by cadet researchers for years to come   We re trolling down the possible pathway for an actual mechanism  and we think we re getting very close with the nitric oxide paradigm  said Turner   Then we can go further into the cell and see what nitric oxide is actually doing  The research is another example of VMI cadets making real contributions to scientific discourse   No one can tell you that undergraduates can t do high end science work and can t be trusted with equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars  said Turner   They can  and they do  I ve had the pleasure and the honor to include all the undergraduates that I work with on my scientific publications as co authors because they all add important bits and pieces to the overall project  That high end science work is possible  in part  because of the equipment available to cadets   The quality of the equipment we have here is just as good as what you would find in a research lab at a large university  said Turner   Our philosophy is that we have this nice equipment and we re certainly not going to keep the cadets from it  The confocal microscope was acquired last year through a  366 000 National Science Foundation grant  VMI professors were among those who contributed project descriptions to the proposal for that grant  according to W L   We have this wonderful scope that was set up last year at Washington and Lee due to the collaboration of faculty members at both institutions  said Turner   You can imagine how convenient it is for cadets who have a restricted lifestyle just to walk a block or so to use this piece of equipment  Prior to the acquisition of the confocal microscope housed at Washington and Lee  students had to travel to James Madison University to use a confocal microscope

Confocal Microscope Advances Cadet Cardiovascular Research Researchers at VMI are working towards uncovering the secrets of blood vessel development and maintenance using a state of the art confocal microscope located at Washington and Lee University  Cadet Fritz Dawson  13 is examining the role that estrogen plays in blood vessel development and  in a related project  Cadet Pete VanSteyn  13 is looking into the importance of nitric oxide in blood vessel development  Both cadets are using developing zebrafish  which are prime candidates for study for many reasons  including the fact that they have relatively simple and regular blood vessel patterns   Why would anyone be working with a fish  some ask   when you re interested in the human heart and blood vessels  said Col  Jim Turner  65  head of VMI s biology department and mentor for the cadet research projects  Turner explained that what is learned from studying zebrafish blood vessels should be applicable to human blood vessels   The belief is that estrogen plays a key role in micro concentrations in both blood vessel development and blood vessel maintenance  said Dawson   We use the zebrafish for a few reasons  They grow really fast  they re transparent so we can see their blood vessels and internal anatomy  and they can internalize chemical solutions through their skin very quickly  Researchers at VMI are working with a type of zebrafish that has been genetically altered to optimize their usefulness in blood vessel research   They have a jellyfish protein gene inserted into their DNA  so that makes their developing blood vessels glow bright green when they re hit with a certain wavelength of light  said Dawson   When you look at them normally they just look like a normal fish  but when they re hit with the laser  all of a sudden you see all of their blood vessels light up  Dawson worked with three groups of zebrafish  a control group  a group that received an estrogen supplement  and a group that was treated with an aromatase inhibitor  which made the fish unable to produce estrogen   What we found is that when estrogen was restricted  the blood vessels would all deteriorate  You can see a significant difference in the normal blood vessel structure  It looks like someone went in there with a weed whacker and cut all these gaps  said Dawson   The fish that received the estrogen supplement showed increased angiogenesis  or blood vessel growth  Just noticing that the blood vessels were deteriorating wasn t enough  Dawson had to find a way to precisely quantify the levels of deterioration to produce a usable set of data   With his creativity and imagination  he was the first person to find a way to get some quantitative data on the development of blood vessels  said Turner   He does that so precisely that his data has already shown a significant difference in the treatment types  Among the factors that Dawson considers are numbers of gaps and the thickness of blood vessels  To do that he needs an image that shows all the blood vessels isolated and in focus  That s what the confocal microscope makes possible   We have the technology here at VMI to view the blood vessels in real time  but what the equipment at W L allows us to do is take a z stack  which is a stack of images taken of different focal points to produce a composite image  said Dawson   So

results than Fritz saw with the estrogen inhibitors  and if you add estrogen back  then you get recovery This line of research is likely to be picked up by cadet researchers for years to come We re trolling down the possible pathway for an actual mechanism  and we think we re getting very close with the nitric oxide paradigm  said Turner   Then we can go further into the cell and see what nitric oxide is actually doing The research is another example of VMI cadets making real contributions to scientific discourse No one can tell you that undergraduates can t do high end science work and can t be trusted with equipment worth hundreds of thousands of dollars  said Turner   They can  and they do  I ve had the pleasure and the honor to include all the undergraduates that I work with on my scientific publications as co authors because they all add important bits and pieces to the overall project That high end science work is possible  in part  because of the equipment available to cadets   The quality of the equipment we have here is just as good as what you would find in a research lab at a large university  said Turner   Our philosophy is that we have this nice equipment and we re certainly not going to keep the cadets from it  The confocal microscope was acquired last year through a  366 000 National Science Foundation grant  VMI professors were among those who contributed project descriptions to the proposal for that grant  according to W L We have this wonderful scope that was set up last year at Washington and Lee due to the collaboration of faculty members at both institutions  said Turner   You can imagine how convenient it is for cadets who have a restricted lifestyle just to walk a block or so to use this piece of equipment Prior to the acquisition of the confocal microscope housed at Washington and Lee  students had to travel to James Madison University to use a confocal microscope  which made research during the semester difficult
