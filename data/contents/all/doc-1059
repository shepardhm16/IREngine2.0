Dinner November 11  2015 General J  H  Binford Peay III Superintendent Members of the Institute Society  Guests  Ladies and Gentlemen  Good evening and welcome to this splendid annual gathering of friends and supporters of the Institute  I am certain that the  forward looking  men and women who created this body forty two years ago  principal among them Joe Neikirk  would be delighted to see how the Society has grown  The Institute has a glorious past  and it is due to the generosity and commitment of you and others that we can look with confidence and optimism to an even brighter future  The Institute Society plays a critical role within the broad VMI family  And VMI is truly that  a family  Perhaps it goes back to the concept of the  Brother Rat Spirit  that has influenced all who have passed through our school  We stand together for one another and we stand together in support of the Institute and its mission to produce educated and honorable men and women for all walks of life  Tonight represents one of the strongest demonstrations of the unity and commitment of this family  and the occasion is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate all that has been done and is being done to advance the Institute  A year ago at this event  the public launch of our latest fund raising effort   An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  A Brilliant Future  The Campaign for VMI  was announced  At that time  I talked about VMI s many strengths in academics  athletics  the military and leadership  but I also posed a challenge by saying that  excellence  costs  and that VMI can no longer rely on state funding to achieve and maintain a high level of excellence  Last year  under the very able direction of Donny Wilkinson  VMI Class 1961 and the Campaign Chair he announced the largest campaign goal in the history of VMI   225 million  As Hugh Fain stated  you took a stand  you accepted the challenge  and  you put us on a path beyond our expectations  I am very pleased to tell you that as of this evening greater than  239 million in gifts and pledges have been received for our Uncommon Purpose Campaign  As impressive as that accomplishment is  our job is not yet done  Our aim is to encourage everyone in the VMI family to be part of this transformative event  Our work continues  the campaign continues  You will hear more about the progress and successes of the campaign as time moves on  But achieving a numerical goal is only a means to an end  And the end is the support and advancement of the Institute  and especially the support and advancement of its cadets and those who teach them  So  tonight  we want you to see the dividends of your investment in VMI  We want to put faces to some of the numbers that have been mentioned  We want you to see what your  taking a stand  for VMI has done for the Institute and our country  Here  then  are a few representatives of hundreds of others I could introduce to you this evening   Cadets and faculty are recognized  Cadet Derrick Ziglar  15 If you recognize Cadet Ziglar  it is because you have seen him on the football field and in one of our  Got a Minute  videos developed for the Campaign  Derrick would not be here tonight without you  The cost of a VMI education was a stretch for his family  as it is for so many   too many   of our accepted applicants  But your generosity provided him with a football scholarship that has enabled him to afford attendance here  Derrick has taken that opportunity and excelled  He is a biology major and a Platoon Lieutenant in Delta Company  He is also the President of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee  Derrick will be commissioned in the U S  Army upon graduation  Cadet Mackenzie Harrmann  16 Cadet Harrmann matriculated from Appleton  Wisconsin  a testimony to how far your influence as alumni and donors has spread across our nation  Mackenzie is a shining example of how donor generosity can recruit and retain the brightest at VMI  She is the recipient of the Francis Smith Award for merit and she has honored your financial support by earning a 4 0 grade point average as a double major in Physics and Applied Mathematics  She has also taken full advantage of your generosity towards faculty support and club sports  Mackenzie prepared herself in the classroom with faculty mentorship and was selected to intern with the Department of Energy  In the Corps  she serves as the Regimental S 2 Captain  she is a member of the Powerlifting Team  and she is a regular in our fitness facilities  She will be commissioned in the U S  Army upon graduation  Cadet Tyler Lighton  15 Tyler has maintained academic stars his entire cadetship  and has done so while competing as a Division 1 NCAA baseball player  An English Major from Chesapeake  Virginia  he is a member of Sigma Tau Delta honor society  He is currently interning with the VMI Foundation under a new program created in collaboration with the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  Many of you probably read his first published piece in the October edition of the Institute Report  Your generosity has helped Tyler to excel on the field and in the classroom  The private resources that allow VMI to maintain a 11 1 cadet to faculty ratio also allows cadets like Tyler direct access to what I think are some of the best instructor  educators in the nation  LTC Tim Moore  97 Although he may not have known it then  donor support played a major role in causing LTC Moore to leave a successful engineering career to return to his alma mater to teach in 2010  Tim recognized at that time the effect that faculty can have on cadets  and he was willing to make the  career change  because of people in this room who have invested in faculty support and academic innovation  With your support  Tim was able to create the  Field to Forum  program  an interdisciplinary program that helps cadets bridge the gap between the classroom and the world of practice as professional engineers  He also created the VMI Clean Energy and Air Resources Program  known as CLEAR  that is noted for developing sustainable bio fuels  The CLEAR Program   with your generous contributions for academic research   gives cadets opportunities to study and create clean burning bio fuels from soybeans  And Tim didn t stop there   he also founded the service group  Keydets Without Borders  Under this program  dozens of cadets have traveled to the mountain village of Pampoyo  in Bolivia  and not only installed a safe water system but also began a project to bring indoor plumbing to each family in the village  If you have supported this group  you have helped make possible a significant drop in infant mortality in Pampoyo  Colonel Moore was the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s Outstanding Faculty Rising Star  Recipient this year  It is no wonder that cadets have said   I know I can make a difference in the world now  and Colonel Moore was the one who helped me see that  COL Jim Turner  65 After a successful career in biomedical research  medical education  and administration  Jim returned to VMI full time in 2001  He has served as VMI s founding director of undergraduate research  he has chaired the Biology Department since 2009  and in 2013 he became the founding chair of the VMI Service Committee  Donor contributions created the Beverly M  Read  41 Institute Professorship in the Arts and Sciences  and Jim s service has been recognized by naming him to this professorship  The Jackson Hope Fund and other academic resources made possible by donors have enabled Jim to engage in transformative mentoring of cadets through his teaching and research interests  He is one of the few VMI alumni or faculty who are two time recipients of the Virginia Military Institute Achievement Medal for exceptional service  He received the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s  Outstanding Faculty  Award this year  and your generosity has played a key role in the work he has done to earn this prestigious honor  Please join me in acknowledging the fine work of these  representative  members of the VMI community and recipients of your generous donations  There are many other achievements of the campaign to date  that could be mentioned  including the establishment of four new professorships  173 new scholarships  73 athletic  gifts and commitments of  6 7 million for research and innovation through the Jackson Hope Fund  fully staffing the Chaplain s Office  a  90 million increase to the overall endowment  and nearly  1 million to conduct renovations of the Stonewall Jackson House and the Turman House  At last May s commencement ceremonies  I told the graduating cadets that while higher education institutions around the country can be demanding and challenging  a VMI education tests them on all levels and that VMI insures a  value based  education  I reminded them that they succeeded not only because of their determination and self discipline  but because they had been  helped  by so many others  Along with family  friends  faculty  coaches  and Brother Rats  that all of you in this room  this evening  had a major hand in their success  too  because of your incredible support  Thank you for your dedication and commitment and for taking a stand in support of OUR VMI  As I have often said   VMI is a

Donny Wilkinson  VMI Class 1961 and the Campaign Chair he announced the largest campaign goal in the history of VMI   225 million  As Hugh Fain stated  you took a stand  you accepted the challenge  and  you put us on a path beyond our expectations  I am very pleased to tell you that as of this evening greater than  239 million in gifts and pledges have been received for our Uncommon Purpose Campaign  As impressive as that accomplishment is  our job is not yet done  Our aim is to encourage everyone in the VMI family to be part of this transformative event  Our work continues  the campaign continues  You will hear more about the progress and successes of the campaign as time moves on  But achieving a numerical goal is only a means to an end  And the end is the support and advancement of the Institute  and especially the support and advancement of its cadets and those who teach them  So  tonight  we want you to see the dividends of your investment in VMI  We want to put faces to some of the numbers that have been mentioned  We want you to see what your  taking a stand  for VMI has done for the Institute and our country  Here  then  are a few representatives of hundreds of others I could introduce to you this evening   Cadets and faculty are recognized  Cadet Derrick Ziglar  15 If you recognize Cadet Ziglar  it is because you have seen him on the football field and in one of our  Got a Minute  videos developed for the Campaign  Derrick would not be here tonight without you  The cost of a VMI education was a stretch for his family  as it is for so many   too many   of our accepted applicants  But your generosity provided him with a football scholarship that has enabled him to afford attendance here  Derrick has taken that opportunity and excelled  He is a biology major and a Platoon Lieutenant in Delta Company  He is also the President of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee  Derrick will be commissioned in the U S  Army upon graduation  Cadet Mackenzie Harrmann  16 Cadet Harrmann matriculated from Appleton  Wisconsin  a testimony to how far your influence as alumni and donors has spread across our nation  Mackenzie is a shining example of how donor generosity can recruit and retain the brightest at VMI  She is the recipient of the Francis Smith Award for merit and she has honored your financial support by earning a 4 0 grade point average as a double major in Physics and Applied Mathematics  She has also taken full advantage of your generosity towards faculty support and club sports  Mackenzie prepared herself in the classroom with faculty mentorship and was selected to intern with the Department of Energy  In the Corps  she serves as the Regimental S 2 Captain  she is a member of the Powerlifting Team  and she is a regular in our fitness facilities  She will be commissioned in the U S  Army upon graduation  Cadet Tyler Lighton  15 Tyler has maintained academic stars his entire cadetship  and has done so while competing as a Division 1 NCAA baseball player  An English Major from Chesapeake  Virginia  he is a member of Sigma Tau Delta honor society  He is currently interning with the VMI Foundation under a new program created in collaboration with the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  Many of you probably read his first published piece in the October edition of the Institute Report  Your generosity has helped Tyler to excel on the field and in the classroom  The private resources that allow VMI to maintain a 11 1 cadet to faculty ratio also allows cadets like Tyler direct access to what I think are some of the best instructor  educators in the nation  LTC Tim Moore  97 Although he may not have known it then  donor support played a major role in causing LTC Moore to leave a successful engineering career to return to his alma mater to teach in 2010  Tim recognized at that time the effect that faculty can have on cadets  and he was willing to make the  career change  because of people in this room who have invested in faculty support and academic innovation  With your support  Tim was able to create the  Field to Forum  program  an interdisciplinary program that helps cadets bridge the gap between the classroom and the world of practice as professional engineers  He also created the VMI Clean Energy and Air Resources Program  known as CLEAR  that is noted for developing sustainable bio fuels  The CLEAR Program   with your generous contributions for academic research   gives cadets opportunities to study and create clean burning bio fuels from soybeans  And Tim didn t stop there   he also founded the service group  Keydets Without Borders  Under this program  dozens of cadets have traveled to the mountain village of Pampoyo  in Bolivia  and not only installed a safe water system but also began a project to bring indoor plumbing to each family in the village  If you have supported this group  you have helped make possible a significant drop in infant mortality in Pampoyo  Colonel Moore was the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s Outstanding Faculty Rising Star  Recipient this year  It is no wonder that cadets have said   I know I can make a difference in the world now  and Colonel Moore was the one who helped me see that  COL Jim Turner  65 After a successful career in biomedical research  medical education  and administration  Jim returned to VMI full time in 2001  He has served as VMI s founding director of undergraduate research  he has chaired the Biology Department since 2009  and in 2013 he became the founding chair of the VMI Service Committee  Donor contributions created the Beverly M  Read  41 Institute Professorship in the Arts and Sciences  and Jim s service has been recognized by naming him to this professorship  The Jackson Hope Fund and other academic resources made possible by donors have enabled Jim to engage in transformative mentoring of cadets through his teaching and research interests  He is one of the few VMI alumni or faculty who are two time recipients of the Virginia Military Institute Achievement Medal for exceptional service  He received the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s  Outstanding Faculty  Award this year  and your generosity has played a key role in the work he has done to earn this prestigious honor  Please join me in acknowledging the fine work of these  representative  members of the VMI community and recipients of your generous donations  There are many other achievements of the campaign to date  that could be mentioned  including the establishment of four new professorships  173 new scholarships  73 athletic  gifts and commitments of  6 7 million for research and innovation through the Jackson Hope Fund  fully staffing the Chaplain s Office  a  90 million increase to the overall endowment  and nearly  1 million to conduct renovations of the Stonewall Jackson House and the Turman House  At last May s commencement ceremonies  I told the graduating cadets that while higher education institutions around the country can be demanding and challenging  a VMI education tests them on all levels and that VMI insures a  value based  education  I reminded them that they succeeded not only because of their determination and self discipline  but because they had been  helped  by so many others  Along with family  friends  faculty  coaches  and Brother Rats  that all of you in this room  this evening  had a major hand in their success  too  because of your incredible support  Thank you for your dedication and commitment and for taking a stand in support

means to an end  And the end is the support and advancement of the Institute  and especially the support and advancement of its cadets and those who teach them  So  tonight  we want you to see the dividends of your investment in VMI  We want to put faces to some of the numbers that have been mentioned  We want you to see what your  taking a stand  for VMI has done for the Institute and our

Derrick has taken that opportunity and excelled  He is a biology major and a Platoon Lieutenant in Delta Company  He is also the President of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee  Derrick will be

village of Pampoyo  in Bolivia  and not only installed a safe water system but also began a project to bring indoor plumbing to each family in the village  If you have supported this group  you have helped make possible a significant drop in infant mortality in Pampoyo  Colonel Moore was the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s Outstanding Faculty Rising Star  Recipient this year  It

last May s commencement ceremonies  I told the graduating cadets that while higher education institutions around the country can be demanding and challenging  a VMI education tests them on all levels and that VMI insures a  value based  education  I reminded them that they succeeded not only because of their determination and self discipline  but because they had been  helped  by so many others

11  2015 General J  H  Binford Peay III Superintendent Members of the Institute Society  Guests  Ladies and Gentlemen  Good evening and welcome to this splendid annual gathering of friends and supporters of the Institute  I am certain that the  forward looking  men and women who created this body forty two years ago  principal among them Joe Neikirk  would be delighted to see how the Society has grown  The Institute has a glorious past  and it is due to the generosity and commitment of you and others that we can look with confidence and optimism to an even brighter future  The Institute Society plays a critical role within the broad VMI family  And VMI is truly that  a family  Perhaps it goes back to the concept of the  Brother Rat Spirit  that has influenced all who have passed through our school  We stand together for one another and we stand together in support of the Institute and its mission to produce educated and honorable men and women for all walks of life  Tonight represents one of the strongest demonstrations of the unity and commitment of this family  and the occasion is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate all that has been done and is being done to advance the Institute  A year ago at this event  the public launch of our latest fund raising effort   An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  A Brilliant Future  The Campaign for VMI  was announced  At that time  I talked about VMI s many strengths in academics  athletics  the military and leadership  but I also posed a challenge by saying that  excellence  costs  and that VMI can no longer rely on state funding to achieve and maintain a high level of excellence  Last year  under the very able direction of Donny Wilkinson  VMI Class 1961 and the Campaign Chair he announced the largest campaign goal in the history of VMI   225 million  As Hugh Fain stated  you took a stand  you accepted the challenge  and  you put us on a path beyond our expectations  I am very pleased to tell you that as of this evening greater than  239 million in gifts and pledges have been received for our Uncommon Purpose Campaign  As impressive as that accomplishment is  our job is not yet done  Our aim is to encourage everyone in the VMI family to be part of this transformative event  Our work continues  the campaign continues  You will hear more about the progress and successes of the campaign as time moves on  But achieving a numerical goal is only a means to an end  And the end is the support and advancement of the Institute  and especially the support and advancement of its cadets and those who teach them  So  tonight  we want you to see the dividends of your investment in VMI  We want to put faces to some of the numbers that have been mentioned  We want you to see what your  taking a stand  for VMI has done for the Institute and our country  Here  then  are a few representatives of hundreds of others I could introduce to you this evening   Cadets and faculty are recognized  Cadet Derrick Ziglar  15 If you recognize Cadet Ziglar  it is because you have seen him on the football field and in one of our  Got a Minute  videos developed for the Campaign  Derrick would not be here tonight without you  The cost of a VMI education was a stretch for his family  as it is for so many   too many   of our accepted applicants  But your generosity provided him with a football scholarship that has enabled him to afford attendance here  Derrick has taken that opportunity and excelled  He is a biology major and a Platoon Lieutenant in Delta Company  He is also the President of the Student Athlete Advisory Committee  Derrick will be commissioned in the U S  Army upon graduation  Cadet Mackenzie Harrmann  16 Cadet Harrmann matriculated from Appleton  Wisconsin  a testimony to how far your influence as alumni and donors has spread across our nation  Mackenzie is a shining example of how donor generosity can recruit and retain the brightest at VMI  She is the recipient of the Francis Smith Award for merit and she has honored your financial support by earning a 4 0 grade point average as a double major in Physics and Applied Mathematics  She has also taken full advantage of your generosity towards faculty support and club sports  Mackenzie prepared herself in the classroom with faculty mentorship and was selected to intern with the Department of Energy  In the Corps  she serves as the Regimental S 2 Captain  she is a member of the Powerlifting Team  and she is a regular in our fitness facilities  She will be commissioned in the U S  Army upon graduation  Cadet Tyler Lighton  15 Tyler has maintained academic stars his entire cadetship  and has done so while competing as a Division 1 NCAA baseball player  An English Major from Chesapeake  Virginia  he is a member of Sigma Tau Delta honor society  He is currently interning with the VMI Foundation under a new program created in collaboration with the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  Many of you probably read his first published piece in the October edition of the Institute Report  Your generosity has helped Tyler to excel on the field and in the classroom  The private resources that allow VMI to maintain a 11 1 cadet to faculty ratio also allows cadets like Tyler direct access to what I think are some of the best instructor  educators in the nation  LTC Tim Moore  97 Although he may not have known it then  donor support played a major role in causing LTC Moore to leave a successful engineering career to return to his alma mater to teach in 2010  Tim recognized at that time the effect that faculty can have on cadets  and he was willing to make the  career change  because of people in this room who have invested in faculty support and academic innovation  With your support  Tim was able to create the  Field to Forum  program  an interdisciplinary program that helps cadets bridge the gap between the classroom and the world of practice as professional engineers  He also created the VMI Clean Energy and Air Resources Program  known as CLEAR  that is noted for developing sustainable bio fuels  The CLEAR Program   with your generous contributions for academic research   gives cadets opportunities to study and create clean burning bio fuels from soybeans  And Tim didn t stop there   he also founded the service group  Keydets Without Borders  Under this program  dozens of cadets have traveled to the mountain village of Pampoyo  in Bolivia  and not only installed a safe water system but also began a project to bring indoor plumbing to each family in the village  If you have supported this group  you have helped make possible a significant drop in infant mortality in Pampoyo  Colonel Moore was the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s Outstanding Faculty Rising Star  Recipient this year  It is no wonder that cadets have said   I know I can make a difference in the world now  and Colonel Moore was the one who helped me see that  COL Jim Turner  65 After a successful career in biomedical research  medical education  and administration  Jim returned to VMI full time in 2001  He has served as VMI s founding director of undergraduate research  he has chaired the Biology Department since 2009  and in 2013 he became the founding chair of the VMI Service Committee  Donor contributions created the Beverly M  Read  41 Institute Professorship in the Arts and Sciences  and Jim s service has been recognized by naming him to this professorship  The Jackson Hope Fund and other academic resources made possible by donors have enabled Jim to engage in transformative mentoring of cadets through his teaching and research interests  He is one of the few VMI alumni or faculty who are two time recipients of the Virginia Military Institute Achievement Medal for exceptional service  He received the State Council of Higher Education in Virginia s  Outstanding Faculty  Award this year  and your generosity has played a key role in
