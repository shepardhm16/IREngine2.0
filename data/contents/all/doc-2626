F  Farrell II  chairman  president  and chief executive officer of Dominion Resources Inc  and the co author and producer of the feature motion picture Field of Lost Shoes  will be the speaker for Virginia Military Institute s graduation on May 16   Mr  Farrell is an ideal speaker for our graduates  said Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI s superintendent   He is an outstanding leader and a superb businessman  and he has been very involved in serving the citizens of the Commonwealth through many activities  The day before the ceremony in which approximately 320 cadets will graduate  VMI will observe the 151st anniversary of the Battle of New Market  The outcome of that Civil War battle was determined by the heroic charge of VMI cadets across a rain soaked field  a story that is dramatized in Farrell s film  The film was released theatrically last fall   Because of all the activities surrounding the filming of the movie and the participation of many cadets  there will be much interest among graduates in hearing what Mr  Farrell has to say  said Cadet Will Connerley  president of the Class of 2015   The story of the New Market cadets is something that becomes a part of every cadet  To see that story on the screen has been an amazing experience for all of us  The film  though  is more than a Civil War film  it is a timeless story of the exuberance of youth  loyalty to comrades  and the meaning of honor  It is a story that describes VMI cadets of every era  Peay said that just as cadets will appreciate Mr  Farrell s understanding of the place that the battle holds in the lore of the Institute  they will also appreciate his example of service much in the manner of the VMI concept of the citizen soldier  He noted that while more than half of VMI s graduates enter the military upon graduation  most of those return to civilian life  but always remain prepared to serve the nation in times of peril while pursuing advanced studies or striving in careers in all walks of life   The citizen soldier is the ideal we inculcate into cadets  Peay said   For us  being a citizen soldier means not only being prepared to take up the sword when needed  but also being ready to serve our fellow citizens in whatever manner promotes the betterment of society  Mr  Farrell s very successful business career is all the more impressive considering his generosity in voluntarily giving his leadership  his time  and his skills to causes of importance in the community and throughout the state  Mr  Farrell joined Dominion in 1995 and has served as an officer of Dominion and many of its subsidiaries  He was executive vice president of Dominion from 1999 to 2003 and was president and chief operating officer from January 2004 to December 2005  In January 2006  Mr  Farrell was named president and chief executive officer of Dominion and was elected chairman of Dominion s board in April 2007  He is the presiding director of Altria Group Inc  Farrell serves on the board of the Edison Electric Institute and was chairman from 2011 to 2012  He also serves as chairman of the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations  He is on the board of visitors at Virginia Commonwealth University and on the board of trustees of both the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges  Farrell is currently chairman of the Governor s Commission on Higher Education  and serves on the board of the Richmond Performing Arts Center  the Virginia Business Council  and the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation  He is a former member of the University of Virginia board of visitors  where he served as rector  and also has served on the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia  He earned his undergraduate degree in economics in 1976 and his law degree in 1979  both from the University of Virginia   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents
