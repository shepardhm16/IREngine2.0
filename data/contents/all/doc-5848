Success  That large audience was ready for participation as Dr  Cathy Seeley  speaker in the conference s first plenary session  asked its members to reflect on their own teaching experiences and

the pieces  It s a method of teaching  said Seeley  that allows and encourages students to struggle  to think  to figure things out  in an environment of trust and collaboration   We learn good stuff from wrong answers  said Seeley  and all students need the opportunity to participate in that kind of learning   the opportunity  she said  for high levels of achievement in math  Today s math students need three things   the Big Three   that students have for decades tried to master  understanding math   making sense of it  doing math   skills  facts  and procedures  and using math   thinking  reasoning  applying it to solve a range of problems   We realize that each of these is dependent upon and lays the foundation for the other two  But today s math students also need something more   In addition to the Big Three  said Seeley   we also need some new stuff  the new basics  deep transferable skills for versatilizing   problem solving  reasoning  research  communication  creativity  In short  said Seeley   You ve got to be able to take the skills you know and apply them to a situation   that didn t exist when you learned them  Math teachers are focusing heavily on these transferable skills and are challenged by that focus   It s hard to learn how to teach this way  said Seeley  To give students all that they need  the U S  education system needs an overhaul  with more teachers grounded in high level mathematical knowledge and every student given the opportunity for quantitative and scientific thinking  Every single student  she said  is a  citizen in a society where mathematics have more to do with everyday life than they ever have in history  That society offers a new generation of assessments   technology driven  challenging  focusing on problem solving skills  with questions that go deep  and take longer   assessments that students will be prepared for if the instruction is good  No need to teach to the test   What students believe matters  what teachers believe matters  and what teachers do about this matters  said Seeley   That s what we ve been talking about  The action item is for teachers to re examine how they put their beliefs into action   We can make small changes in our own behavior that will allow our students to succeed  said Seeley   It s absolutely necessary   Raise the floor and raise the ceiling  Bring up all

Learning in the 21st Century  espoused a  you we I oriented teaching scheme   upside down teaching   in which the teacher approaches her math students this way   You re going to mess around with an interesting problem  We re going to talk about that  I m going to make sure that I connect the pieces  It s a method of teaching  said Seeley  that allows and encourages students to struggle  to think  to figure things out  in an environment of trust and collaboration   We learn good stuff from wrong answers  said Seeley  and all students need the opportunity to participate in that kind of learning   the opportunity  she said  for high levels of achievement in math  Today s math students need three things   the Big Three   that students have for decades tried to master  understanding math   making sense of it  doing math   skills  facts  and procedures  and using math   thinking  reasoning  applying it to solve a range of problems   We realize that each of these is dependent upon and lays the foundation for the other two  But today s math students also need something more   In addition to the Big Three  said Seeley   we also need some new stuff  the new basics  deep transferable skills for versatilizing   problem solving  reasoning  research  communication  creativity  In short  said Seeley   You ve got to be able to take the skills you know and apply them to a situation   that didn t exist when you learned them  Math teachers are focusing heavily on these transferable skills and are challenged by that focus   It s hard to learn how to teach this way  said Seeley  To give students all that they need  the U S  education system needs an overhaul  with more teachers grounded in high level mathematical knowledge and every student given the opportunity for quantitative and scientific thinking  Every single student  she said  is a  citizen in a society where mathematics have more to do with everyday life than they ever have in history  That society offers a new generation of assessments   technology driven  challenging  focusing on problem solving skills  with questions that go deep  and take longer   assessments that students will be prepared for if the instruction is good  No need to teach to the test   What students believe matters  what teachers believe matters  and what teachers do about this matters  said Seeley   That s what we ve been talking about  The action item is for teachers to re examine how they put their beliefs into action   We can make small changes in our own behavior that will allow our students to succeed  said Seeley   It s absolutely necessary   Raise the floor and raise the ceiling  Bring up all students  By doing so  we identify stars we had never seen before    We can turn untapped potential into unlimited potential
