provide sufficient opportunities for the subject to freely consider whether or not to participate  If the subject is a minor  written parental consent or legal guardian consent is required  and the investigator must obtain the assent of the child unless the child is incapable of giving assent   The information given to the subject  or the subject s legally authorized representative  must be in simple  easily understood language  If the subject population is not English speaking  the informed consent must be presented in whatever language is appropriate  If the person uses an alternative form of communication  e g  Sign Language  the informed consent process must be designed to enable effective communication in the appropriate mode   If a potential subject is illiterate  the investigator will be required to use a competent witness to verify voluntary informed consent  Written documentation of the consent process  e g  a cover letter or cover sheet  is always required unless specifically waived by the IRB  The consent document should be signed by the subject or the subject s legally authorized representative unless this requirement is waived by the IRB   In some types of projects  it may be important for information pertaining to consent to be provided verbally  In such an instance  a written summary  script  of what the potential subject will be told must be provided to the IRB for review and approval  Investigators should explain the rationale for not obtaining written informed consent in order that the IRB may approve such an exception  No informed consent  whether oral or written  may waive or limit in appearance or in fact  the subject s legal rights  including any release of the Institute or its agents from liability or negligence   The following information must be a part of all written informed consent documents   A statement that the project is research and an explanation of the scope  aims and purposes of the research  and the experimental procedures to be followed  including the expected duration of the subject s participation  This statement should include a description of any anticipated benefits the subject or others might reasonably expect    Identification of the investigator  faculty sponsor  if relevant  as well as the name of any other sponsoring or funding source supporting the research  IUP should be

PROTECTION OF HUMAN SUBJECTS    A description of any reasonable foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject  including likely results if an experimental treatment should prove ineffective  If the risk potential is currently unknown or not measurable  a statement to that effect will be required     A statement regarding the availability of compensation  medical treatment  or other services if injury occurs will be required for research which involves more than minimal risk  If compensation or medical treatment will be provided  information about how it may be obtained or where further information may be secured will be required     A statement of any new information developed during the course of the research which may relate to the subject s willingness to continue participation will be provided  Related to this  an offer to answer any questions the subject  or the subject s representative  might have regarding the subject s rights shall be included  This statement should include the name  address and or telephone number of the principal investigator as the contact point if questions or problems should occur     A statement describing the method by which confidentiality of records identifying the subject will be maintained     A statement that participation is voluntary and that refusal to participate or a subsequent decision to discontinue participation will not result in penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled  This statement should include a description of the consequences  if any  that accompany such a decision to withdraw and should explicitly state methods of withdrawal     A copy of the informed consent shall be provided to the subject or the subject s legally authorized representative  Federal law mandates that copies of all informed consents be retained for a minimum of three years after completion of the research  The principal investigator is responsible for the maintenance and retention of such records  If the principal investigator is a student  the faculty sponsor is responsible for the maintenance of these records  If the investigator leaves the Institute within this three year period  all records must be forwarded to the Office of Assistant Dean for Research   One example of an acceptable informed consent document is included at he website for the committee  Additional examples are available upon request  These are only to be used as examples or guides for the formulation of individual informed consents and not as standard forms  The specific form used for each project must be tailored to the subject characteristics  specifics of the project procedures  and nature of the potential risks to subjects  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My
