magazine    VMI File Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  July 14  2015   Virginia Military Institute is ranked second among public schools in Virginia  and third among all schools in Virginia  in Money magazine s annual college rankings  released earlier this week  Overall  VMI ranked 16th among public colleges and universities nationwide  The magazine s rankings of more than 700 colleges and universities across the country focus heavily on return on investment   the amount of money a student is likely to earn with a degree from a particular college or university  minus the total net cost of attending that school  A school s graduation rate  calculated as the percentage of first year students who earn a degree within six years  is also a critical part of the rankings  For VMI  Money magazine calculated the net price of a degree at just under  94 000  Net price rankings were determined by taking the average amount students and parents pay each year  minus scholarships and grants that do not have to be paid back  and multiplying that figure by the average amount of time it takes a student at a particular school to earn a degree  Tuition increases are also considered when calculating the net price of a degree  Money magazine reported that VMI s young alumni   those who have graduated within the last five years   earn an average salary of just over  53 000  This figure is drawn partially from salary data self reported to Payscale com  an independent website that allows individuals to report their earnings and compare their data with those of others with similar experience and skills  Recent findings on market value by the Brookings Institution are also taken into consideration in this year s ranking  In its report on the rankings  the Washington Post states that Money magazine s rankings supply much needed hard data that is not considered in rankings by other publications  That additional information  according to the Post  should help students and parents make an informed decision when choosing a college  The Post notes   Money magazine tries to answer the questions that prospective students should be asking on their college tours this summer  What is the graduation rate  net price  what s the real tuition they ll pay  how much do they and their parents have to borrow in loans  and will they learn any marketable skills that will help them get a job in order to pay back those loans  In this year s Money magazine rankings  only the University of Virginia ranked higher among public schools in Virginia  Among all colleges and universities in Virginia  only U Va  and Washington and Lee University were ranked higher than VMI  Overall  VMI was ranked in 48th place nationwide  well ahead of schools such as James Madison University  The Citadel  and the College of William   Mary  The service academies were not included in Money magazine s rankings  The full list of rankings can be found at http time com money best
