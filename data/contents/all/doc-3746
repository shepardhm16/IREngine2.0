Better Faculty   Better College At the heart of any great educational institution is its faculty  and the Virginia Military Institute is no exception The Board of the Jackson Hope Fund recognizes the importance of faculty development and has provided funds for faculty members to travel to professional conferences and to conduct research  It also has supported leaves to allow faculty to engage in scholarly activities within their respective disciplines  such as conducting research and writing books  as well as providing technology training grants to prepare the faculty for teaching in the 21st century   Since 2001  the Institute s Academic Program has enjoyed remarkable and generous support from the Jackson Hope Fund  support that has profoundly shaped and sustained the intellectual development of the Corps of Cadets  said Brig  Gen  Charles F  Brower IV  former Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty   The significance of the Jackson Hope Fund cannot be exaggerated  Contributors to the Fund have stepped forward impressively to provide the Institute the support it needs to maintain the academic momentum we have generated and to further sharpen the edge of academic excellence we all seek to create  Brower added that the selection of VMI Philosophy Professor Duncan Richter as an Outstanding Faculty Award winner for the Commonwealth of Virginia for 2008 marked the fifth VMI OFA winner since 2002   The competition for this award is extraordinarily intense  as the pool of talent in the Commonwealth is sparkling and deep  said Brower   For the Institute to compete successfully requires careful recruitment  high standards and clear expectations  rigorous evaluation  and an aggressive commitment to faculty development  In my judgment  the Jackson Hope Fund played a crucial role in our successes in faculty development and recruitment these past few years  providing funding for the faculty s travel to present the fruits of its scholarly engagement  support for a broad array of faculty development projects  and resources for our recruitment efforts to help us to attract the high quality faculty we need to educate our cadets and establish our national reputation as a premier undergraduate college  Col  Mary Ann Dellinger knows well the value of support from the Jackson Hope Fund  It made possible a faculty development leave in 2008 for her to continue the draft of her monograph  The Muse Unchained  Politics  Prison  and Poetry in Francoist Spain  The writing portion of the project followed considerable research  most of which had to be completed in Spanish archives and with personal interviews with ex political prisoners  The professor of modern languages and cultures also attends two conferences in Spain each year thanks to Jackson Hope funding   At VMI we pride ourselves on development of the  whole cadet  which often relegates our research to the proverbial back burner  yet we cannot uphold academic excellence  much less our ratings  nor model intellectual behaviors for cadets  if faculty members do not contribute to the existing body of knowledge in their respective fields  said Dellinger   Scholars need time for research as well as the travel opportunities to share findings and to open new lines of inquiry within their professional community  I am profoundly indebted to Jackson Hope for the research opportunities they have provided cadets I have mentored and especially my own work    Like Dellinger  Lt  Col  Daren Timmons requested a departmental leave to better understand how

Texas A M University  The leave was productive  resulting in a paper published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society  along with a review article in Coordination Chemistry Review  and several others are in the works  One of Timmons  former cadets is now a graduate student in chemistry working in Zhou s lab  and the professor is back in his lab at VMI  mentoring several cadets in undergraduate research  Despite the complexities involved in transplanting his family and joining a new lab  Timmons said the time on leave was well worth it   Just having large blocks of

Better Faculty   Better College At the heart of any great educational institution is its faculty  and the Virginia Military Institute is no exception The Board of the Jackson Hope Fund recognizes the importance of faculty development and has provided funds for faculty members to travel to professional conferences and to conduct research  It also has supported leaves to allow faculty to engage in scholarly activities within their respective disciplines  such as conducting research and writing books  as well as providing technology training grants to prepare the faculty for teaching in the 21st century   Since 2001  the Institute s Academic Program has enjoyed remarkable and generous support from the Jackson Hope Fund  support that has profoundly shaped and sustained the intellectual development of the Corps of Cadets  said Brig  Gen  Charles F  Brower IV  former Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty   The significance of the Jackson Hope Fund cannot be exaggerated  Contributors to the Fund have stepped forward impressively to provide the Institute the support it needs to maintain the academic momentum we have generated and to further sharpen the edge of academic excellence we all seek to create  Brower added that the selection of VMI Philosophy Professor Duncan Richter as an Outstanding Faculty Award winner for the Commonwealth of Virginia for 2008 marked the fifth VMI OFA winner since 2002   The competition for this award is extraordinarily intense  as the pool of talent in the Commonwealth is sparkling and deep  said Brower   For the Institute to compete successfully requires careful recruitment  high standards and clear expectations  rigorous evaluation  and an aggressive commitment to faculty development  In my judgment  the Jackson Hope Fund played a crucial role in our successes in faculty development and recruitment these past few years  providing funding for the faculty s travel to present the fruits of its scholarly engagement  support for a broad array of faculty development projects  and resources for our recruitment efforts to help us to attract the high quality faculty we need to educate our cadets and establish our national reputation as a premier undergraduate college  Col  Mary Ann Dellinger knows well the value of support from the Jackson Hope Fund  It made possible a faculty development leave in 2008 for her to continue the draft of her monograph  The Muse Unchained  Politics  Prison  and Poetry in Francoist Spain  The writing portion of the project followed considerable research  most of which had to be completed in Spanish archives and with personal interviews with ex political prisoners  The professor of modern languages and cultures also attends two conferences in Spain each year thanks to Jackson Hope funding   At VMI we pride ourselves on development of the  whole cadet  which often relegates our research to the proverbial back burner  yet we cannot uphold academic excellence  much less our ratings  nor model intellectual behaviors for cadets  if faculty members do not contribute to the existing body of knowledge in their respective fields  said Dellinger   Scholars need time for research as well as the travel opportunities to share findings and to open new lines of inquiry within their professional community  I am profoundly indebted to Jackson Hope for the research opportunities they have provided cadets I have mentored and especially my own work    Like Dellinger  Lt  Col  Daren Timmons requested a departmental leave to better understand how molecules self organize into either flexible or rigid systems  A Jackson Hope funded leave allowed him to do just  and he spent a semester in the research laboratory of Professor Hong Cai Zhou at Texas A M University  The leave was productive  resulting in a paper published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society  along with a review article in Coordination Chemistry Review  and several others are in the works  One of Timmons  former cadets is now a graduate student in chemistry working in Zhou s lab  and the professor is back in his lab at VMI  mentoring several cadets in undergraduate research  Despite the complexities involved in transplanting his family and joining a new lab  Timmons said the time on leave was well worth it   Just having large blocks of uninterrupted time each day to read  to think  to conduct experiments  to write  to publish in short  to  do chemistry  was wonderfully refreshing and motivating Academics Home Jackson Hope Fund Video
