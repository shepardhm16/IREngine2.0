refer to the group with which a cadet matriculates and to the individuals within that group  A cadet entering in the Fall of 1854 became a member of the Class of 1858  this Class identification is

 I was soon enlightened as to the cause of the disturbance by an old cadet who in the dim light of the very early morning  as he stood dressing close by  I had not noticed  He remarked in a tone which seemed anything but motherly   Rat  get up  Sir  and go to reveille  My grandfather attended VMI in the 1940 s and he is still living  I m writing a family history for a reunion and I d really like to

Research FAQs VMI Ancestor Research Frequently Asked Questions Genealogy   Alumni top level The VMI Archives receives many inquiries every week from family historians seeking information about a VMI ancestor  This page includes answers to some common questions  Have a question not answered here  For additional information  contact the VMI Archives   How do I determine if my ancestor attended VMI  First  check our Online Historical Rosters Database  The database contains the names of all students who attended VMI from the opening of the Institute in 1839 through 1945  as well as non alumni who were sent to VMI for training during World Wars I and II  Many 19th and early 20th century roster records also contain a biographical summary  Once you identify an ancestor  contact us for additional available records  Please note that we do not release information about living individuals  Why do your records refer to my ancestor as a member of the  Class of 1858  even though he did not graduate  VMI uses the  Class of  designation to refer to the group with which a cadet matriculates and to the individuals within that group  A cadet entering in the Fall of 1854 became a member of the Class of 1858  this Class identification is used whether or not the student continued until graduation  Think of  Class  in terms of a descriptive label rather than graduation status  My ancestor attended a  military school  before the Civil War  but he was much too young for college  Was VMI ever a secondary school prep school high school  VMI was established as the first state supported military college in the United States and it has never offered high school level classes  Numerous military secondary schools were established throughout the South during the 19th century  but these prep schools were not part of or affiliated with the Institute  To see if your ancestor attended VMI  see our Online Rosters Database  My ancestor attended VMI in the 19th century  Can you provide a copy of his application  The application process during the 19th century did not include the kind of formal application document with which we are familiar today  Rather  it typically consisted of correspondence between the school and parents  as well as gathering letters of recommendation for consideration by the VMI Board of Visitors  We often have correspondence in our files relating to the admission process and cadetship of individuals  You can learn more about the early application process here  For information about a specific person  please contact us  I m looking for a photograph of my ancestor  Can you help  We have a very extensive photograph collection  which can be searched online  Individual photographs exist from the 1850 s forward  although not of every cadet  Class group photos first became popular in the 1870 s  but were typically taken only during the First Class  Senior  year  The first yearbooks were not published until the late 19th century  In short  we have many cadet photographs  but do not have a photograph of every cadet  If you have a question  please contact us  My relatives have always told me that my great great grandfather attended VMI  but you don t have any records that confirm this  Are some of your enrollment records missing  Our enrollment records are very complete and we are confident that we can document VMI enrollment  Family oral history is a valuable tool for starting your research  but it is not always accurate  Your ancestor may have attended another military college  or a military secondary school  or served in the military  or he may have applied to but not actually attended VMI  My ancestor entered VMI as a  third classman  What does that mean The VMI class system is  Fourth Freshman  Third Sophomore  Second Junior  First Senior  In the 19th century  it was relatively common for well prepared students to enter the Institute as a  third  What is a  Rat  A  Rat  is the name for new cadets  the term was
