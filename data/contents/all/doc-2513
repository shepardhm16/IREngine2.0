School Beginning this academic year  cadets majoring in chemistry will be able to choose one of two degree tracks   a research track  the curriculum all majors have followed in the past  or a pre med track designed specifically for those interested in pursuing a career in the health professions  The new  more structured curriculum should better prepare cadets to take the Medical College Admission Test   MCAT   which is expected to be more important than ever in the admissions process   The MCAT is changing starting in 2015 to measure not only chemical  physical  and biological sciences  but also adding psychological and social components  said Lt  Col  Dan McCain  associate professor of chemistry   Access to health care and socioeconomic issues are becoming big issues in health care  The idea for a pre med track has been in the works for about two years and is a collaborative effort between the chemistry  biology  psychology  and applied mathematics departments  Most chemistry majors will decide which track they will follow prior to their 3rd Class year   A lot of the courses they take are the same   only some of the upper level courses are different  and  pre med cadets  will be choosing a specific set of electives  said McCain  Cadets on the pre med track will be taking more biology courses than a typical chemistry major would  In place of part two of physical chemistry and analytical chemistry  they will take cell biology and genetics   Biological systems are at their heart chemical systems  so you have to understand them on both levels to really understand what is going on  McCain explained  The math requirements will also be geared more toward the medical field  with statistics taking the place of Calculus III  Likewise  whereas cadets on the research track have 15 hours of free electives and a three hour humanities elective  those on the pre med track   with the exception of a free elective writing intensive course   will fill those elective slots with suggested courses relevant to the health professions  In the process  they will meet the requirements for a concentration in biochemistry and molecular biology   There is flexibility built in for those who are interested in pre pharmacy or being a physician s assistant    We can tailor the program for them  McCain said For example  cadets with an interest in pre pharmacy could take microbiology or morphology for their elective courses  Since VMI s chemistry degree is certified by the American Chemical Society  one of the most difficult parts of structuring the pre med curriculum was making sure the degree still met the society s requirements  Another challenge was making sure there would be room for chemistry majors in the classes offered by other departments  McCain is extending the focus on better preparing cadet for the MCAT into his classes by incorporating more activities similar to those found on the MCAT    Not just because of the test  but because they re good for critical thinking  he explained  While he is introducing concepts in formats similar to those seen on the MCAT  the best way for cadets to prepare for the test is still to take practice exams on their own time   If you re going to medical school  you have to be pretty selfmotivated  said McCain  This includes taking the initiative by contacting health clinics or hospitals to set up a shadowing program in which cadets observe a physician for a day  or volunteering for mission work in the medical field during the summer   I hope  the pre med track  will help them become more well rounded and better prepared for medical school    that it expands their horizons and gives them an idea of how people think in other disciplines  said McCain   I hope it prepares them better for their careers  By  Daniel Stinnett  07 IR   Oct  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non
