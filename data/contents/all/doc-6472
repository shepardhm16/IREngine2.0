McKethan Park    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  Projects include REDHORSE Work at McKethan Park LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  5  2014   There is no better teacher than hands on experience  Cadet Dakota Nicely  15 recently learned that lesson  He spent the summer working as an intern with the VMI construction office and was on hand as the Virginia Air National Guard s 203rd REDHORSE Squadron helped erect a pavilion and a latrine at McKethan Park   It s been a great experience  said Nicely   I ve learned a lot  The purpose of the REDHORSE   Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers  squadron s McKethan Park project was to help maintain its members  military occupational skills and  in turn  to facilitate the training of VMI cadets  Users of the facility will include not only the Corps  but also Virginia National Guard units  law enforcement organizations  and community organizations   He  Nicely  got very involved in the McKethan Park project  said Karen Austin  who was contracted by VMI from WW Associates to serve as a construction project manager   At first  he was interfacing with Col   Keith  Gibson  77  about an information sign for the pavilion and assisting with the budget  then  he  got into it hands on  helping the Guard build  That s when his real education began  While he got his hands dirty  literally  Nicely also took the opportunity to soak up as much knowledge as he could during the four weeks that he worked on the project   I  took  in everything they said  said the 1st Class cadet from Clifton Forge  Va   Whenever they were doing something new  I wanted to be there listening  Nicely arrived at McKethan Park in a rather roundabout  and unlikely  way  He is a business and economics major  but over the last few years  he has developed an affection for the construction business  particularly the management side  He inquired about a possible internship with the construction department  Col  Dale Brown  the director of construction  offered him a position  Nicely realized that he couldn t pass up the chance   Playing football here  I knew that if I got a job here I would be able to work out with the football team  said Nicely  who saw playing time as a backup linebacker last season   I figured I couldn t beat the opportunity to have a paid internship  work close to home  and be able to work out with the football team  Before heading out to McKethan Park  Nicely was introduced to the construction business through some other jobs on post  repairs to the stoops in New Barracks  waterproofing of the roof on Old Barracks  and planning for construction of a Leadership Reaction Course and maintenance building at North Post   He s a business major  so he had little exposure to construction projects  Austin explained   His real duty was to learn  absorbing everything he could about construction jobs and their management  Nicely gradually took on more as the summer progressed  however  Austin said that at first  Nicely just attended project meetings  where he learned about writing briefs and preparing agendas  Later  Nicely conducted a staff briefing and a project meeting  and he aided Austin by developing a spreadsheet to track submittals and keep track of the progress on the stoop project in barracks  He even stood in for an inspector on one occasion  On the Military Leadership Field Training Grounds Project  Nicely arranged for some training supplies from Fort Pickett  Austin admitted that Nicely still has a great deal to learn about construction management  but his experience this summer was invaluable   Construction projects are complex  even the small ones  she said  adding that his experience was  a great way to see how projects work and how the work is organized to occur smoothly and efficiently  As it turns out  Nicely s summer internship had one more perk he wasn t counting on  It also connected him with a long lost family member  His first cousin  whom he had not seen in four years  was a member of the National Guard squadron and spent two weeks working on the McKethan Park project  Nicely relished the chance to reconnect with him   We were about to start the meeting to kick off the project  and I got a text from my cousin  said Nicely   He asked if I was going to be in Lexington this summer because his National Guard unit was going to help build a shelter  I told him that s my project  He pulled up five minutes later  It was cool to hang out with him for two weeks  It was educational as well   Chris Floyd  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
