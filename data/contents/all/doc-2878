strong foundation in chemistry  mastery of modern chemical instrumentaton  excellent analytical and mathematical skills  and the ability to think things through and solve problems  The department offers two degree tracks  the B S  degree and the B A  degree in chemistry  The B S  degree provides the most comprehensive preparation for further work or study in chemistry or a related field such as  Chemical Engineering Material Science Environmental Science Pharmacology The chemistry department s Bachelor of Science is approved by the American Chemical Society  and cadets fulfilling the requirements for a Bachelor of Science are certified as having met the standards of professional training by the society  The Bachelor of Arts degree provides cadets with an opportunity to pursue other interests in preparation for a career of their choosing while providing a solid foundation in the basic areas of chemistry  This degree requires cadets to choose another focus area outside of chemistry and complete either a minor  concentration or certification  Faculty members work closely with Bachelor of Arts majors to design a program that best meets the cadets  career goals  Career choices may correspond to the following focus areas  Medical or dental school   Concentration in biochemistry and molecular biology Military or intelligence agencies   International studies minor  science and security minor  Arabic minor Law enforcement or forensics   Concentration in biochemistry and molecular biology Business MBA   Business or economics minor Math science teacher   Teacher certification program Faculty members believe close interaction with cadets in the classroom and in the chemical laboratory is critical in the development of good chemistry majors  This personal mentoring occurs in many ways but especially in our small classes and during undergraduate research projects  All majors are encouraged to participate in an undergraduate research experience under the guidance of a faculty member either in a 10 week summer program or during the academic year  The majority of chemistry majors participate in at least one undergraduate research experience  Most of these cadets will present their research at a local or regional professional meeting  and a smaller number will have their results published  Chemistry majors also have the opportunity to work as industrial interns with a company during the summer  Majors who have demonstrated excellence in the study of chemistry are invited to participate in the departmental honors program during their 1st Class year  Cadets who accept the invitation will be engaged in extensive research under the close supervision of a faculty sponsor  The laboratory facilities  instrumentation  library  and computer services housed in the Science Building provide majors with the modern techniques needed to learn and practice the science of chemistry both in structured courses and labs and also in independent research  Instrumentation includes liquid and gas chromatographs  several infrared  visible  ultraviolet  and fluorescence spectrometers  nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers  a gas chromatography mass spectrometer  along with an atomic absorption  d c  plasma  and flame emission spectrometers  The department also maintains a computer facility for molecular modeling and chemistry tutorials  All chemistry majors are encouraged to join the active Student Affiliate Chapter of the American Chemical Society  The chapter sponsors visiting speakers  trips to industrial and government laboratories  and several social events during the year  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non
