History of the VMI Honor System   Honor Court The ideas expressed in the following excerpt from a recent VMI Honor Code publication would be familiar to a cadet of the 1840 s  Although the administration of the honor system has evolved since VMI was founded  the concept of honor has always been integral to the VMI experience   The purpose of the Honor Code is to maintain the high standards traditionally attributed to VMI cadets by seeking to instill in all cadets the desire to conduct themselves according to the code of an honorable cadet  who will NEITHER LIE  CHEAT  STEAL  NOR TOLERATE THOSE WHO DO  All cadets should be able to determine right from wrong  and thus be able themselves to arrive at honorable answers to their questions  The Code is the heart of VMI   VMI Honor Code  2010   The Historical Development of the Honor System  1839   An honor code has been in existence from the earliest days of the Institute  although it was not published in written form until the early 20th century Francis H  Smith  VMI s first Superintendent  emphasized the importance of honorable behavior  and it was a tradition firmly established long before the Civil War  Little documentation exists prior to 1908  A rare explicit reference by Smith to the honor code of the 19th century can be found in a letter of January 22  1868 addressed to the Commandant of Cadets  At this time  VMI was still struggling with the aftermath of the Civil War and was engaged in rebuilding the Institute   I deem it of great importance to the tone of the Corps of Cadets to get re established among them the Code of Honor  Several cadets have brought the subject to my attention  1870  Although there are no remaining documents  1870 is cited in subsequent years as a turning point in the development of an Honor Court   Early issues of cadet publications such as the student newspaper and yearbook refer to the long history of the honor system  However  an Honor Court did not operate continuously from 1870 1908  and nothing is known of its rules  In the excerpt below  the second part of the last sentence  and it has functioned ever since  is likely not accurate   Probably the greatest asset of a man s character  and one which stands out in every VMI man  is honor  This is a trait not recently acquired  but the product of a rigid system of honor rules which have been respected and obeyed by the corps for years The honor system is not a novel feature  ever since the foundation of VMI there has been some form of it  From 1839 to 1870 the corps at large controlled such matters as were brought before it  In 1870 the real formation of an honor court took place and it has functioned ever since   The Cadet  1925 September 28  1908   This is the year most frequently cited as the beginning of the Honor Court as it is known today  one which operated continuously from year to year  The Superintendent s Annual Report for 1907 1908 references its development  stating that it is  composed of cadets  members of the upper classes  who are elected by their classmates    1920 s   Annual publication of detailed rules became common by the mid twenties  Early Court regulations often listed both honor violations and lesser transgressions of a disciplinary nature  As the system of cadet government matured and become more formal  other bodies took over non honor issues  The modern Honor Court addresses only matters pertaining to the Honor Code  1930 s   forward   Although the composition and mechanics of the Honor Court  and the text of the Honor Code rules  continued to be revised  the key components of the honor system have remained unchanged since this time  VMI s system is single sanction   a cadet found guilty of an honor offense is dismissed from the Institute View article about Honor Court reorganization  1952  View Examples from the 1920 s   1930 s click to enlarge    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES
