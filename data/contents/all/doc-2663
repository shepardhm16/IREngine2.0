Kevin Remington  More than 100 Commission into Four Services in Joint Ceremony Watch the joint ceremony LEXINGTON  Va  May 15  2015   Approximately 150 VMI cadets commissioned into the armed services earlier today in a joint commissioning ceremony held in Cameron Hall  Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  Institute superintendent  reminded those commissioning that their service is a fulfillment of the Institute s mission of creating citizen soldiers   VMI is proud of you  said Peay   Our country is fortunate to have you and your decision to lead  The superintendent also referred to the significance of the day as the 151st anniversary of the Civil War Battle of New Market  in which 10 VMI cadets died of their wounds  For the past several decades  commissioning at VMI has been held on May 15 in observance of the New Market anniversary  Administering the oath of office to nearly 100 cadets commissioning as second lieutenants in the U S  Army was Gen  Daniel B  Allyn  35th vice chief of staff of the Army  Allyn  a four star general with combat experience in Kuwait  Iraq  and Afghanistan  among many other locales  told the soon to be officers that they were entering the Army at a historic and increasingly dangerous time  In such a time  officers of strong and principled character are desperately needed  Allyn noted   Your soldiers will follow you anywhere if they trust you  he said   You will earn their trust day in and day out by consistently choosing the harder right over the easier wrong  For some of the new Army second lieutenants  military service has been a lifelong dream   and that s especially true of Hardy Hendren  15  a biology major from Goshen  Ky  who said he d been thinking about becoming a soldier since kindergarten   Ultimately  it s just who I am  said Hendren of his decision to serve   I feel like it s a great opportunity to serve both the people under your care and the bigger purpose  On May 28  Hendren will report to Ft  Benning  Ga  to begin infantry training  After that s completed  he ll head to Ft  Bragg  N C  where he ll be a member of the storied 82nd Airborne Division   I m really excited  and I m definitely looking forward to it  said Hendren  Commissioning as second lieutenants in the U S  Marine Corps were approximately 20 cadets  who took the oath of office administered by Lt  Gen  Ronald L  Bailey  deputy commandant for plans  policies  and operations  The 38 year Marine Corps veteran humorously reminded those about to commission that they wouldn t remember much about the ceremony  then told them to keep in mind three  ships  leadership  ownership  and mentorship  All three are connected to one s mindset  said Bailey   Think good thoughts  because they become good words  and good words become good actions  and good actions become good habits  and good habits become a part of your character  Sharing an attitude of elation just after his insignia was pinned on was Marine Corps 2nd Lt  Patrick de la Cruz  15  who d been thinking of the Marine Corps since childhood   It s a surreal moment  said de la Cruz   I ve been waiting a long time for this  It feels like a dream  De la Cruz s dream began when he was a child in south Florida and heard his father  who had immigrated to the United States from the Philippines  talk about his service in the Philippine marine corps   In his time  he interacted with a lot of U S  Marines and he always spoke highly of them  recalled de la Cruz   It s always been the Marines Corps for me  Like all newly commissioned Marine Corps second lieutenants  de la Cruz will next attend The Basic School at Quantico  Va  before learning his specialty assignment  Just under 30 cadets entered the U S  Navy as ensigns  taking their oath of office from Rear Adm  James W  Kilby  commander of the Naval Surface Warfighting Development Center in San Diego  Calif  He began his remarks by sharing a quote from VMI s own Confederate Gen  Thomas J   Stonewall  Jackson   A patriot volunteer  fighting for his country and his rights  makes the most reliable soldier on earth  Added Kilby   I could not agree more  Like Allyn  Kilby stressed that those entering the service will be called upon and tested  Roughly 50 percent of the Navy s service members are deployed at any given time  the rear admiral said   We are the first responders  Kilby urged the new ensigns to be guided by the Navy s core values of honor  courage  and commitment   Embrace them  reflect on them  not only in times of challenges but in all times  so they remain fresh  he counseled  When she took her oath to join the Navy  Ensign Morgan Robinson  15 was following in a path familiar to others in her family  as her father retired from that branch of the service and her sister is currently serving   I m really looking forward to being in the Navy and being able to serve my country the best way I can  said Robinson  a civil engineering major from Concord  Va  who will attend dive school in Panama City Beach  Fla  this summer before moving on to Eglin Air Force Base  also in Florida  where she ll attend explosive ordnance disposal school  Robinson  one of three women to graduate from VMI with a civil engineering degree this year  said she feels that field of study had prepared her well for the Navy   In  explosive ordnance disposal  you use a lot of physics based things  and we did a lot of that in civil  she commented  Approximately 12 cadets commissioned in the U S  Air Force during this morning s ceremony  taking their oath of office from Gen  Darren W  McDew  82  commander of the Air Mobility Command  Scott Air Force Base  Ill   Today you commit to a profession that is more than a job  McDew told the cadets   It s a higher calling    Your duty is leadership  pure and simple  Taking McDew s words to heart  and those of the other commissioning officers  was Air Force 2nd Lt  Kyle Morse  15  An electrical and computer engineering major at VMI  Morse will serve as a developmental engineer at Los Angeles Air Force Base  Calif   I don t know exactly what my job will be  but I ll be designing stuff  said Morse  explaining that the base where he ll be stationed specializes in weapons and space system design   It s very exciting to get to work    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
