Tick Rover II Tick Rover Gen II by Tommy Kendzia  Ben Absher  and Chris Baber  12  In 2012 Tommy Kendzia and Washington and Lee student Ben Absher constructed an improved version of the first generation tick rover originally tested in 2006  The 2006 robot had shown proof of concept of using a robot to reduce tick populations  this second generation robot was designed to be rugged enough to withstand independent laboratory testing for two weeks at Fordham University in New York  The robot was demonstrated at the Virginia Academy of Science and the MARCUS undergraduate research conference at Sweet Briar  Although the scientific tests were not able to be carried out because of uncooperative weather conditions  the scientists at Fordham did conduct two weeks worth of engineering field tests with it  during which time the robot performed flawlessly  We decided to incorporate some of the suggestions generated during the two week field testing into a third generation of the robot  to be tested at Old Dominion University in the summer of 2013  The project is advised by James Squire and David Livingston of VMI s Department of Electrical Engineering  Jay Sullivan of VMI s Department of Mechanical Engineering  and Daniel Sonenshine of Old Dominion University s Department of Biology  Back Tick Rover II Tick Rover Gen II by Tommy Kendzia  Ben Absher  and Chris Baber  12  In 2012
