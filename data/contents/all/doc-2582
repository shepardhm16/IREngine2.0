of accredited business programs   In the competitive market for employment or to go to graduate school  to be able to say you earned your degree at an accredited business school is very important  he

been successful   It s made us better  said Moreschi of the accreditation process   It s improved our curriculum and our faculty  With renewal just five years away  Moreschi knows that the department can t rest on its laurels  either  as the AACSB looks for a strategic plan and efforts to improve what s already working well   We have to stay at that level  he said   VMI  Department of Economics
