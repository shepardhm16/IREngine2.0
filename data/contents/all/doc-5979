Engineering Building is opening up new avenues of research while promoting interdisciplinary cooperation  Assistant professor of mechanical engineering Maj  Ryan Taylor  04 and associate professor of physics Lt  Col  Merce Brooke  94 brought their expertise together to make the lab a reality   The lab was initially Ryan s idea  so he came to me and asked what I thought about doing this  said Brooke   We put the proposal together  got the lab set up by January  Now we ve got preliminary results  and we ve got some ideas that we re going to work on over the summer  The lab consists of equipment provided through several sources  including a Jackson Hope grant for acquisition of a Nd YAG laser   a powerful laser based on yttrium  aluminum  and garnet crystals   The Jackson Hope grant of  77 000 allowed us to get this key piece of equipment  said Taylor   VMI as a whole chipped in another  46 000  and the department added another  60 000  These funds paid for the customization of a space in NEB for the laser lab  acquisition of a high sensitivity ICCD camera  and construction of a housing for the entire system   You can think of the lab as a really expensive camera system with an even more expensive flash  said Taylor   The idea is that you shoot a laser to illuminate a small quantity of gas  When the laser hits the gas  it glows  so you can image the glow and track how it moves  The system tracks that movement with extreme precision  allowing researchers to capture data on the order of microseconds or nanoseconds  millionths or billionths of a second   We re still fine tuning the system  It s not an easy experiment by any means  said Brooke   There are a lot of aspects to coordinate  you ve got the laser and the camera and everything has to link together and trigger within nanoseconds  so it has been a learning process  but we ve made a lot of progress  Cadets are already taking advantage of the facility  Kelsey McCusker  13 is using the lab to study heat flow inside miniature structures as part of her honors thesis  The lab allowed McCusker to study the airflow for a given space by using the laser to illuminate gases while the camera captured data  Imaging the flow of the gases provides detailed information about their position and velocity   The laser lab was an integral part of my research project  said McCusker  a mechanical engineering major   The laser lab opens opportunities to explore this velocity technique in many different ways  and only a few other schools in the country have this technology  While the laser lab is already a powerful research tool  faculty members are looking for ways to further enhance the lab s capabilities by adding new systems   We ve already applied for a grant of  100 000  said Brooke  That grant would allow the lab to perform laser induced breakdown spectroscopy  or LIBS   You take a laser pulse and focus it with such high energy that it essentially rips the air molecules apart  said Brooke   That produces a flash of light and the light is associated with different atoms and ions inside the gas  so then you can map out the composition of the gas  Research opportunities in the lab extend outside the fields of engineering and physics   This laser lab can also be used to explore biological or other physical phenomena as well  said McCusker   Having this technology has opened a lot of doors for cadets down the road to investigate higher level research questions not previously feasible at VMI  Its use will also reach cadets not involved in research  offering learning opportunities by illustrating concepts taught in the classroom   It gives a nice link between what s on the board and what s actually occurring in practice  said Taylor  By  John Robertson IV IR   April 2013 VMI
