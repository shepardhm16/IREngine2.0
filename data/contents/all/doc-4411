after he graduated from VMI in the spring of 1970 with a Bachelor s Degree in History  He became a board member with the VMI Club of Richmond in 1974 and was its President for a year spanning 1979 80  His enthusiasm and leadership were recognized  and he was invited to serve on the Alumni Association Board of Directors from 1979   1985  Following his term on the Alumni Board  he was asked to join the Keydet Club Board of Governors  He served on the Keydet Club Board and as a member of the Executive Committee for 14 years until he became its President  serving for two fiscal years   1999 and 2000  Today  he remains on the Executive Committee  first as the Immediate Past President and now as the Historian of the Keydet Club  Throughout the last 30 years  Ralph and Marsha Costen have been recognized amongst VMI s most loyal and generous supporters of VMI athletics   evidenced in 2011 when they were awarded the Keydet Club s Spirit of VMI Award  VMI and the Keydet Club have always been able to count on the Costens to step up in the time of need  Recently  recognizing VMI s need to increase athletic endowment during the recently launched VMI Campaign  the Costens again answered the call by creating The Costen Family Athletic Scholarship   I guess my drive to get involved and support VMI was more out of the tremendous gratitude I had  and still have  for the opportunities VMI has given me  I m not proud of it  but the fact is  I was initially turned down for admissions in the winter of 1966  but strong encouragement from a few VMI alumni at that time got me an opportunity for which I will forever be grateful  I wasn t a good student nor was I an outstanding cadet  but VMI certainly impacted me and my life  and I believe VMI still impacts the lives of so many young people today  said Costen   Ralph and his wife Marsha have always done whatever they could to support VMI  and now  along with their son Ralph L  Costen  III  97  Tripp  and his wife Jill Sisler Costen

is and how he  Marsha  and Tripp feel about The Institute  VMI will continue to benefit from the Costen family s actions and example for many  many years to come  It is only fitting that now in

Board President Bill Paulette  69  Ralph L  Costen  70 with his wife Marsha and their son Ralph L  Costen  III  97  Tripp  and his wife Jill Sisler Costen  and their children      Costen Family Athletic Scholarship Created Ralph L  Costen s financial support of VMI started soon after he graduated from VMI in the spring of 1970 with a Bachelor s Degree in History  He became a board member with the VMI Club of Richmond in 1974 and was its President for a year spanning 1979 80  His enthusiasm and leadership were recognized  and he was invited to serve on the Alumni Association Board of Directors from 1979   1985  Following his term on the Alumni Board  he was asked to join the Keydet Club Board of Governors  He served on the Keydet Club Board and as a member of the Executive Committee for 14 years until he became its President  serving for two fiscal years   1999 and 2000  Today  he remains on the Executive Committee  first as the Immediate Past President and now as the Historian of the Keydet Club  Throughout the last 30 years  Ralph and Marsha Costen have been recognized amongst VMI s most loyal and generous supporters of VMI athletics   evidenced in 2011 when they were awarded the Keydet Club s Spirit of VMI Award  VMI and the Keydet Club have always been able to count on the Costens to step up in the time of need  Recently  recognizing VMI s need to increase athletic endowment during the recently launched VMI Campaign  the Costens again answered the call by creating The Costen Family Athletic Scholarship   I guess my drive to get involved and support VMI was more out of the tremendous gratitude I had  and still have  for the opportunities VMI has given me  I m not proud of it  but the fact is  I was initially turned down for admissions in the winter of 1966  but strong encouragement from a few VMI alumni at that time got me an opportunity for which I will forever be grateful  I wasn t a good student nor was I an outstanding cadet  but VMI certainly impacted me and my life  and I believe VMI still impacts the lives of so many young people today  said Costen   Ralph and his wife Marsha have always done whatever they could to support VMI
