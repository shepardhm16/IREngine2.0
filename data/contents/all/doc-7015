Federal Reserve Bank Field Trip Federal Reserve Bank Field Trip Wednesday  5 December  2007  snow and ice covered I81  wind battered vehicles crawled along  and visibility was almost nonexistent  Nevertheless  16 brave and emboldened EC BU majors fought the elements and traveled to Richmond to tour the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank  This was the second semester during which Col  Gutermuth s Money and Banking class was able to tour the Fed and meet with the interesting folks involved with the management of this country s monetary policy  The tour included the usual areas open to the public  the law enforcement center  where cadets asked Fed officers what their personal choice of firearms was  the  cash area  where millions and millions of dollars pass through every day  and where we held a healthy discussion on the possible ways one might rob a Federal Reserve Bank and concluded there is absolutely NO possible way  and of course the board room where important meetings are held  and cadets impressed the tour guide with their knowledge of the complex structure of the Fed and its components  This semester s trip was uniquely special due to the help of a recent VMI graduate  John Nemish  class of  02 is currently an assistant examiner for the Richmond Fed and made  special arrangements for our visit  We began by having a spectacular lunch in the executive dining room  situated on the 21st floor and with equally spectacular views  Another alumnus  Brannon Howle  class 0f  99  joined us for lunch and talked about his job with a newly created department of the Fed  Of course  with that many cadets and alumni in one room   war stories  abounded  We were somewhat taken aback when Jeff Lacker  the president of the Richmond Fed  came in  with his entourage  and spoke briefly with us  It was a surprise because he is on the powerful FOMC  Federal Open Market Committee  which was gearing up to meet in less than a week  While Mr  Lacker was not at liberty to tell us what actions the committee might be taking  he was open about the atmosphere of the meetings under the relatively new leadership of Chairman Ben Bernake  His style was obviously informal  albeit professional  and all those around him clearly had the highest regard for him  After the tour  the group engaged in an informal Q A session  Employees of the Fed made quite an impression as to the friendly atmosphere and collegiality of the organization  Another VMI alum  Eddie Arnaldo  class of  91  explained how the Fed was very accommodating when he got called up for military duty  and made a potentially difficult situation bearable  Bottom line  All seemed quite happy with their positions at the Fed and all seemed to love what they do  In the end  we all felt welcome and special on our
