that an introduction to computer programming should start in front of a computer writing code  There are many barriers that one must address when teaching this information  and the unfortunate reality is that the most common strategy used in classrooms across America only works for a small percentage of learners  and it can be detrimental to someone developing a knowledge and passion for writing code  In this workshop  we will learn to address these issues by going on a journey looking at methodologies that I have used to help ease students into computer programming along with gaining insight into adjusted curriculum that took students from falling asleep at the site of code and morphed them into actively engaged learners  This workshop will be specifically tailored for Arduino microcontroller programming  but all methods are applicable no matter what language or technology someone is teaching  No experience in programming required  Prepare for an energy packed presentation

Grant and Christopher Newport University Teaching Programming Without Writing Code   Grades 3 8 It is a common misconception that an introduction to computer programming should start in front of a computer writing code  There are many barriers that one must address when teaching this information  and the unfortunate reality is that the most common strategy used in classrooms across America only works for a small percentage of learners  and it can be detrimental to someone developing a knowledge and passion for writing code  In this workshop  we will learn to address these issues by going on a journey looking at methodologies that I have used to help ease students into computer programming along with gaining insight into adjusted curriculum that took students from falling asleep at the site of code and morphed them into actively engaged learners  This workshop will be specifically tailored for Arduino microcontroller programming  but all methods are applicable no matter what

Creative and Real World Engaging Experiences Realized this Summer  CAREERS  program was created for at risk and low performing 7th and 8th grade students as an alternative to a traditional summer school  Furthermore  research has shown that college and career readiness should be started in the middle school to help assess personal interest and future goals through career exploration  The program hired teachers to create project based learning units that were created around the 16 career clusters  Each project focused on competencies of problem solving  flexibility  collaboration and time management  It also embedded reading and math skills  The culminating project was for students to select one project and create a visual representation of the process of how they worked to create a project to answer a driving question or solve a challenge  In addition  students researched a potential career cluster of interest and presented it to community members  The hands on presentation will showcase the many projects that included some STEM PBL  MakerSpace  water rocket science  textile engineering  technologically related projects  t shirt shop  and the culminating project  Participants will examine the projects at different stations and fill out a handout that will prompt them to ask questions  write observations and how it could be used in other schools  After the activity  the presenters will answer questions  discuss the benefits and lessons learned from the program  The attendees will receive ideas and ways to incorporate project based learning units that include STEM and technology into their curriculum  The SOLSs covered will be non fiction reading skills  physical science SOLs and various math standards  This workshop covers project based learning

components of developing a high school STEM program  The first component will focus on the use of incorporating data so that the division recognizes the need for STEM initiatives  This may even include assisting in dissolving traditional district boundaries  Component two will focus on identifying stakeholders who would develop a steering committee  community partnerships  community  local industry and post secondary education  and an advocate for the process  This component will show that a rural community needs to come together with resources to create a lasting and effective STEM education infrastructure  This leads into the third component  Professional development and fourth component  Technology  It is extremely important that educators within the division adopt and are trained in the effective use of technology and distance learning  The final component is the capstone of the program which includes internships and the inclusion of CTE programs  This workshop covers

Putting the  T  in STEM Learning   Grades 3 8 Are you overwhelmed with the idea of integrating STEM tools in the classroom  Do you need help determining what tool would be the best fit for you and your students  Is cost the factor  Grade appropriateness  Subject area  Or maybe you need ideas on how integrate tools into your curriculum needs  Come learn and experience 5 STEM learning tools and how they can facilitate interdisciplinary classroom experiences including a hands on showcase of Squishy Circuits  Makey Makey  Finch Robot  Hummingbird Robotics  and LilyPad Arduino  The presenters will share these tools and the research gained from using them in the classroom  as well as share some of the challenges and successes with implementations  Attendees will get the opportunity to see example projects  learn about ways they have been integrated into multiple subject areas and SOLs  and ignite an interest in utilizing these tools into their own classrooms  In addition to the showcasing of 5 STEM learning tools  the presenters will share additional STEM tools that could be used in the classroom  Although part of the workshop will be lecture  there will be time to explore the tools and projects  ask questions  and brainstorm with the other attendees  This workshop covers technology for teachers with students in grades 3 8  Instructors   Paula Leach  Ph D  Director

Teaching Programming Without Writing Code   Grades 3 8 It is a common misconception that an introduction to computer programming should start in front of a computer writing code  There are many barriers that one must address when teaching this information  and the unfortunate reality is that the most common strategy used in classrooms across America only works for a small percentage of learners  and it can be detrimental to someone developing a knowledge and passion for writing code  In this workshop  we will learn to address these issues by going on a journey looking at methodologies that I have used to help ease students into computer programming along with gaining insight into adjusted curriculum that took students from falling asleep at the site of code and morphed them into actively engaged learners  This workshop will be specifically tailored for Arduino microcontroller programming  but all methods are applicable no matter what language or technology
