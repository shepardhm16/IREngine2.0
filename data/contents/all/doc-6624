Jackson Hope Prize for Excellence in Published Scholarly Work is only in his fourth year teaching at VMI   but he s already guided one cadet to publishing his research in an international journal  Lt  Col  Dimplekumar Chalishajar  associate professor of applied mathematics  worked alongside Cadet Andrew Stanford  16 to create a mathematical model of a diabetic s response to insulin treatment  Their coauthored work   Mathematical Analysis of Insulin Glucose Feedback System of Diabetes  was published in the International Journal of Engineering and Applied Sciences in July 2014  At the time the two began working together  in the fall of 2013  Stanford was only a 3rd Class cadet  but he d impressed Chalishajar so much during his 4th Class year that Chalishajar sought him out and asked if he d like to do independent research  Stanford  a civil engineering major and applied math minor  didn t blanch at working outside of his field   and neither did Chalishajar  who at the time was new to the field of mathematical biology   Teaching is just the best way of learning  said Chalishajar of their collaboration   I was not teaching my cadet  I was just learning new things with him  Stanford  meanwhile  was more than open to learning new things  He and Chalishajar had discussed an engineering problem for an independent study  but Stanford hadn t yet had all of the necessary civil engineering coursework to complete such a project  He had  though  taken a college level biology course in high school  since his alma mater  Gar Field Senior High School in Prince William County  Va  offered an International Baccalaureate curriculum  Neither Stanford nor Chalishajar understood how diabetes affects the various organs in the body  though  so the two received welcome assistance from Col  Jim Turner Sr   65  head of the biology department at VMI   Interactions and collaborations always give you a better idea  noted Chalishajar  Stanford explained that having a biologist s input was crucial to avoid producing a paper that had flawless math but a faulty understanding of the human body   One of the chronic flaws with mathematicians and engineers as a whole is you can have a great process and great calculations  but if you assumed wrong  it means nothing  said Stanford  In addition  Maj  Geoff Cox  assistant professor of applied mathematics  provided help with coding in Matlab  a computer program frequently used by mathematicians   He just blew us out of the water  said Stanford of Cox s contribution   I tried to do what he did and I couldn t even get close  With the paper now published  Stanford is looking to the future   and pondering his options  He s contractually obligated both to the Army National Guard and the Virginia Department of  Transportation s Engineering Scholar Program  but graduate school seems a likely possibility down the road   The independent study  opened my eyes to what are the kinds of possibilities I can have in my life   graduate school   at least a master s  said Stanford   It s something I want to pursue now  because now I know I can do this  With his and Stanford s work now published  Chalishajar has moved on to helping two other cadets with independent study projects  He and David Geary  16  an applied math major  are working to create a mathematical model showing when an individual s body crosses the line from being healthy to being diabetic  In addition  Chalishajar is helping Michael Hutwelker  17  a mechanical engineering major  with an independent study having to do with bending a beam  In devoting so much time to cadets completing independent study projects  Chalishajar is following the advice given to him by a professor in his native India  when he was finishing work on his own doctorate years ago   Once you are done with your Ph D  never stop  Chalishajar recalled his adviser as saying   Just continue on with your work  Try to give your knowledge to some of the students    You can share your knowledge with students only if you are active in the field    By  Mary Price IR   Dec  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety
