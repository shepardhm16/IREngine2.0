Lake Vineyard San Gabriel  Cal  January 22  1904 General Scott Shipp Supt  V M I  Lexington  Va  My dear General  I explained to you when I saw you that I confidently anticipated that my son would receive the Senatorial Appointment from California  to West Point  to take effect next June  and that I hoped he would be able to enter upon his certificate from V M I  which you stated was possible if his standing should prove to justify it  From the reports which I have received  I gather that his standing is sufficiently good to warrant me in feeling quite confident that he can pass into West Point next spring with your certificate  In the meantime a complication has arisen the result of which is  that the Senator has felt himself obliged  instead of making an outright appointment  to call for an informal competitive examination of several applicants for his appointment  and has set February 15  in Los Angeles  as the date for this examination  From all the circumstances in the matter  and from some knowledge of the other applicants  I feel myself justified in believing that my son stands certainly the best chance of passing the required test which besides is only advisory to the Senator s judgment in the matter  he stating explicitly that he always considered not only the result of a mere mental test  but other qualifications of dignity  bearing  and antecedence indicating the probability of a successful applicant being a useful officer in the army  Under all these circumstances  I have written to my son  advising him to come home and stand the examination  He will apply to you for a furlough of thirty days  beginning about February 1st  This will enable him to arrive at home a few days before the examination and to recover from the fatigue of the trip  as well as to refresh himself upon the primary subjects in which he may be possibly examined  He will return to the V M I  immediately after the examination  and in case he is successful in the same and receives the appointment  will expect to go from there in due course to enter the academy in June  I am enclosing a New York Draft to the order of the Treasurer of VMI for  290 00 of which  165 00 is to be applied in payment of the bill rendered with the last report of my son  and the other  125 00 to be handed by you to him when his furlough is granted  with which to purchase his ticket and pay his traveling expenses home  If appointed to West Point  I shall regret  in many ways  that he is not able to continue the full course at Lexington  but as he has definitely decided upon an army career  I feel that he should not be denied the benefit which is conferred by graduation from West Point if it is possible for him to secure this advantage  I am assuming somewhat in the foregoing that there will be no difficulty in his receiving a proper certificate from you  which will enable him to enter without presenting himself for the entrance examination on May 1st  If for any reason I am mistaken in this assumption  you will of course  notify me so that I may guide myself accordingly and have him make some preparation for the necessary entrance examination in May  I am writing my son fully on even date  and he will doubtless call upon you  and I would be greatly obliged for such advice as you may be able to give him in the premises  I am Yours very sincerely  Geo  S  Patton P S  It seems highly probable that for some years to come the number of appointments to the army from Civil life will be much fewer than for some years past  And this is one of the reasons I feel that my son should not miss the present opportunity  As I am anxious to get this off today and it is past banking hours  I am sending a personal local check instead of a N Y  draft  the bank being closed for the day  I have added one dollar to the amt  making it  291 to cover exchange  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index

Patton Family Letter  January 22  1904  Appointment to West Point Patton Family top level Office of Geo  S  Patton Lake Vineyard San Gabriel  Cal  January 22  1904 General Scott Shipp Supt  V M I  Lexington  Va  My dear General  I explained to you when I saw you that I confidently anticipated that my son would receive the Senatorial Appointment from California  to West Point  to take effect next June  and that I hoped he would be able to enter upon his certificate from V M I  which you stated was possible if his standing should prove to justify it  From the reports which I have received  I gather that his standing is sufficiently good to warrant me in feeling quite confident that he can pass into West Point next spring with your certificate  In the meantime a complication has arisen the result of which is  that the Senator has felt himself obliged  instead of making an outright appointment  to call for an informal competitive examination of several applicants for his appointment  and has set February 15  in Los Angeles  as the date for this examination  From all the circumstances in the matter  and from some knowledge of the other applicants  I feel myself justified in believing that my son stands certainly the best chance of passing the required test which besides is only advisory to the Senator s judgment in the matter  he stating explicitly that he always considered not only the result of a mere mental test  but other qualifications of dignity  bearing  and antecedence indicating the probability of a successful applicant being a useful officer in the army  Under all these circumstances  I have written to my son  advising him to come home and stand the examination  He will apply to you for a furlough of thirty days  beginning about February 1st  This will enable him to arrive at home a few days before the examination and to recover from the fatigue of the trip  as well as to refresh himself upon the primary subjects in which he may be possibly examined  He will return to the V M I  immediately after the examination  and in case he is successful in the same and receives the appointment  will expect to go from there in due course to enter the academy in June  I am enclosing a New York Draft to the order of the Treasurer of VMI for  290 00 of which  165 00 is to be applied in payment of the bill rendered with the last report of my son  and the other  125 00 to be handed by you to him when his furlough is granted  with which to purchase his ticket and pay his traveling expenses home  If appointed to West Point  I shall regret  in many ways  that he is not able to continue the full course at Lexington  but as he has definitely decided upon an army career  I feel that he should not be denied the benefit which is conferred by graduation from West Point if it is possible for him to secure this advantage  I am assuming somewhat in the foregoing that there will be no difficulty in his receiving a proper certificate from you  which will enable him to enter without presenting himself for the entrance examination on May 1st  If for any reason I am mistaken in this assumption  you will of course  notify me so that I may guide myself accordingly and have him make some preparation for the necessary entrance examination in May  I am writing my son fully on even date  and he will doubtless call upon you  and I would be greatly obliged for such advice as you may be able to give him in the premises  I am Yours very sincerely  Geo  S  Patton P S  It seems highly probable that for some years to come the number of appointments to the army from Civil life will be much fewer than for some years past  And this is one of the reasons I feel that my son should not miss the present opportunity  As I am anxious to get this off today and it is past banking hours  I am sending a personal local check instead of a N Y  draft  the bank being closed for the day  I have added one dollar to the amt  making it  291 to cover exchange
