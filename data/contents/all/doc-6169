and genres of 20th century Hispanic literature  This course emphasizes the refinement of previously acquired language skills such as speaking and writing and places additional emphasis on reading literary texts for practicality and writing across the curriculum  This course is viewed as an introduction to Hispanic texts  Course goals The goals of this course are for each student to  1  reach a level of sophisticated expression in written and oral Spanish 2  broaden vocabulary and grammar 3  improve pronunciation 4  improve listening skills through exposure to the   language in and out of the classroom 5  utilize correct grammar  syntax and a choice of words in a style   appropriate for composition 6  read  discuss  and write about short pieces of 20th century fiction   and web materials in Spanish 7  Create a web portfolio Click here for calendar and daily assignments Texts  WEB BASED A good Spanish English dictionary  Recommended Larousse  Grading scale  The grading scale will be as follows  90 100 A 80 89 B 70 79 C 60 69 D 50 59 F Grade Distribution  Your grade will be based on 1 one hour examination  20  classroom comments  10  2 compositions  30  a web portfolio  10  and final examination  30  1 one hour examination   20  You will have 1 one hour examinations  the date of which will be announced on the class calendar  Classroom comments   10  You must make comments in class in Spanish  This is necessary for you to improve your foreign language skills  as well as for others to hear as much Spanish as possible  2 compositions   30  I will ask you to react to certain fictional writings in the form of a composition  You will do two of these and I will specify topics and dates at a later time  No help from another person whatsoever is permitted  No help from internet or automatic translators is permitted  Each composition should be at least 2 4 typed pages  Additional  shorter compositions may be assigned as well  in addition to these two  Students are permitted to use Microsoft Word Spanish spell check grammar check as well as ATAJO  Online dictionaries  not translators  are allowed  Composition defined  an original essay of 18 23 typed lines per page  of original material  written for the purpose of practicing grammar and rhetoric  I assign three types of essays  First I assign response essays in which the student reacts to a piece of fiction   This is usually a two page composition  Second  after introducing the students to a new author and his her literary traits I have the students write an essay discussing the author and his her style and detailing how a piece of fiction reflects this author s characteristics   This is a four page composition  Third  I assign an essay which helps the students bring closure to the course by writing their own literary history of what they have learned through the semester such as life and traits of authors  what they wrote  and their influences    A four page composition  Occasionally I also have students write shorter compositions comparing a few authors  as well as explicating a text  or even comparing a text to a film   Each of these is a three page composition  Each composition must be revised at least once for grammar and once for style  Web portfolio 10  Each student will compose a web journal on a specific topic of interest  for example an author not covered in class  This should not simply be a gateway page with links  Rather  you are responsible for researching your topic  writing a journal on this topic  and updating your website regularly with pertinent links  The journal will be in Spanish and I will help monitor it for grammatical accuracy  Among other writings  you may import portions of your corrected essays into your website  I will provide instruction on composing websites  Final examination  30  Cadet Faculty Responsibility on Work for Grade Click here for Modern Language Dept  policies on work for Grade Bulger Barnett s helped received
