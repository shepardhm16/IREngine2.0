investigator must complete an IRB application  On the IRB application the investigator should indicate the number of the category under which an exemption is claimed  Final determination as to whether a project is exempt rests with the IRB  If a research project is certified as exempt by the IRB  the investigator need not resubmit the project for continuing IRB review as long as there are no
