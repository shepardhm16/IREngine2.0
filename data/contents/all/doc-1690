24450 SURI Project Leads Cadet Mathematician into the Realm of Finance Institute Report  August 2011 This year s Summer Undergraduate Research Institute projects marked a rise in quality and an interdisciplinary trend  Lt  Col  Keith Kline  associate professor of psychology  supervised the program  the first since he took the helm as director of the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  The center moved recently from Mallory Hall to Level 3 of Preston Library   We re trying to raise the bar in terms of the quality of work that is sponsored by VCUR  and we re trying to convince these young people that they are developing scholars and treat them as such  Kline noted that this year s group included four interdisciplinary projects  projects involving a cadet working with faculty from more than one department or a cadet from one department working with a faculty member from another  Math major Jacob MacIntyre  12 paired up with professor of finance Col  Bob Moreschi in a project of the latter kind  MacIntyre looked at NASCAR to determine if the stock market accurately values the expected impact of a major corporate sponsorship   Finance  to a large degree  is a quantitative field where the application of one s knowledge of math  especially statistical analysis  is required  said Moreschi  MacIntyre found  however  that he had a whole lot of work to do before he would be in a position to apply his own knowledge of math   I had to teach myself business finance  said MacIntyre   I didn t know what an IPO  initial public offering  was  or a portfolio  And he had to learn to do research  just to get started   It took a long time just to get the list of sponsors because there was no database  said MacIntyre  adding  incredulously   I had to go to microfilm in the library to look at the Wall Street Journal   Jacob is using his applied math skills  learning finance  and also learning about the challenges social science researchers have in collecting good data with which to perform a variety of analysis  said Moreschi   I had to read up on NASCAR as well  added MacIntyre  who said he is no fan of the sport  He s much more fond of soccer and has played on VMI s NCAA team for the past three years  Though he has friends who are playing professional soccer or are  celebrities  on their campuses  MacIntyre said he has no regrets about coming to VMI and looks forward to greater involvement with the Corps during his 1st Class year  He will be dyke to a rat and will serve as a cadet counselor in addition to playing soccer  MacIntyre would also like to further develop his SURI project during the upcoming year if there s time  Having started last spring on the waiting list for SURI funding and then overcome the challenges of getting up to speed in a new discipline  MacIntyre can put what he will take away from this project in one simple phrase   Never give up  Kline values interdisciplinary projects like MacIntyre s because they help cadets think creatively and make connections   His  MacIntyre s  gain  added Moreshi   is the exposure to finance and learning how his applied math major might be useful outside of the math department  Thirty five cadets participated in the 2011 SURI program  16 of whom presented their work in four sessions July 28  The remaining cadets will present their research during fall semester  VMI Foundation Keydet
