Philosphy  Optics    Artillery Tactics The VMI Museum is a major repository of artifacts relating the life of one of America s revered Civil War generals  Thomas J  Jackson  His favorite hat  two uniforms  items from his classroom and even his war horse   Little Sorrel  can be seen in the museum  Born on January 21  1824  in Clarksburg  Virginia  now West Virginia  Jackson was orphaned as a young child  He had little formal education  This did not stop him from seeking an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point  Upon his graduation on July 1  1846  Jackson was commissioned as a second lieutenant of artillery and he entered the fighting in Mexico  By the end of the war  Jackson had been promoted twice  holding the rank of Brevet Major  In 1848 new  specially made cannon arrived at VMI  They were 300 pounds lighter than regular guns and painted red  Jackson trained cadets with these cannon  In 1851  the VMI Board of Visitors was seeking a professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Physics  who could also teach artillery tactics  In February the superintendent of VMI offered Jackson the position at the Institute  which he accepted  A marginal professor of natural philosophy  Jackson proved to be an excellent instructor of artillery  Using the Cadet Battery   six cannon made especially for VMI  Jackson ruled the parade ground  The cannon can still be seen at VMI today  He was a strict taskmaster  with unbending integrity and fearlessness in the discharge of duty  The major was described as being  as exact as a multiplication table and as full of things military as an arsenal    Professor Jackson wore this blue uniform at VMI and at the Battle of Manassas  The coat was recently restored with the greatful support of the Virignia Division of the UDC    If Jackson was exacting in the demands he made upon the cadets  he was no less so in the demands he made upon himself  At VMI  Jackson taught his classes with the same directness with which he thought  He never wavered in his character  in his devoutness to church  his dependability  faith and resolution  These qualities overshadowed any professorial deficiencies and set a standard that even his young cadets recognized as one of greatness  Jackson would become an active business and religious figure in the Lexington community  Finding religious direction from George Junkin  a noted Presbyterian minister who was president of Washington College  he became a member of the Presbyterian Church  During visits at the Junkin household  he fell in love with the youngest daughter Ellie  They were married after a quiet courtship  and they established their life in the Junkin household  It was the happiest time that Jackson had known until then  This happiness was to be short lived when Ellie died during the birth of their first child  Jackson was profoundly grieved and recovered slowly  After a trip to Europe in 1856  he returned home and proposed marriage to Mary Anna Morrison  the daughter of another Presbyterian minister who also happened to be president of a college  Davidson  Thomas and Mary Anna purchased a home on Washington Street  the only home he would ever own  and they became the idealized Victorian couple  In 1859 VMI cadets had an indication of what was to come with the abolitionist John Brown s raid on the federal arsenal at Harper s Ferry  Brown was captured by a detachment of U S  Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E  Lee  USA  At his trial he was found guilty of conspiring to commit treason and was sentenced to be hanged  With fear of another uprising to aid Brown s escape  the Governor of Virginia sought the aid of the VMI cadets to provide additional military presence  On November 25  1859 Jackson moved a contingent of cadets to Harper s Ferry where they helped maintain order during Brown s execution on December 2     Little Sorrel  is one of two Civil War Horses to be mounted at death  He died in 1886  In early April 1861  the unrest among the people of Lexington provoked several incidents  one of which resulted in one of Jackson  s few public speeches  One Saturday afternoon attempts were made to raise two flags in Lexington  one for secession and one for remaining in the Union  Lexington had strong Unionist feelings  many of the settlers of the area having come from Pennsylvania  The cadet corps tended toward a strong secessionist sentiment  as many of the cadets were from Tidewater Virginia  Many of them were in the town  as they had been released from duty  Excitement increased when a somewhat violent man drew a revolver and knife upon a squad of cadets  and though onlookers who intervened quelled the difficulty  word quickly spread back to VMI that a group of cadets was in danger  At the barracks  the already aroused cadets grabbed their guns and began to run toward town  The superintendent headed them off and ordered them to return to barracks  There the corps was assembled  and the superintendent urged Jackson to speak to the cadets   Military men make short speeches  he said   and as for myself  I am no hand at speaking anyhow  The time for war has not yet come  but it will come and that soon  and when it does come  my advice is to draw the sword and throw away the scabbard  With the outbreak of hostilities  the cadets were ordered to Richmond to serve as drill instructors for Confederate recruits  Under Jackson s command  the cadets left VMI on April 21  1861  and reported to Confederate headquarters at Camp Lee  There Jackson was commissioned a colonel in the Confederacy and  leaving his cadets at Camp Lee  moved on to active military service with the Southern forces    Jackson was wearing this raincoat when he was wounded by his own men  From Manassas  1861  to Chancellorsville  1863  where he was fatally wounded  Lieutenant General Jackson was unequaled on the battlefield  Using his knowledge of the Shenandoah Valley he baffled his opponents  His tactics of quick movement and stealth are still studied today by military leaders from around the world  Jackson s accidental wounding by his own troops at Chancellorsville occurred on the night of May 2  1863 during the confusion of the hotly contested battle  His badly wounded left arm was amputated  but the general died of complications in the early hours of Sunday morning  May 10  Jackson s name was still carried on the VMI faculty roll at the time of his death  for he had expressed his intention of returning when the war was over  He was the first faculty member to die since VMI was founded in November 1839  His body was brought to Lexington by packet boat on the afternoon of May 14  The VMI Corps of Cadets met the boat and escorted the body of their former commander to VMI where it lay in state in his old classroom with cadets standing as guards  The cadet battery  which Jackson so long commanded  fired salutes from sunrise to sunset  One day later  Stonewall Jackson was buried in the Lexington cemetery that now bears his name  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  VMI MUSEUMS  VMI Museum   Virginia Museum of the Civil War   Stonewall Jackson

did not stop him from seeking an appointment to the United States Military Academy at West Point  Upon his graduation on July 1  1846  Jackson was commissioned as a second lieutenant of artillery and he entered the fighting in Mexico  By the end of the war  Jackson had been promoted twice  holding the rank of Brevet Major  In 1848 new  specially made cannon arrived at VMI  They were 300 pounds lighter than regular guns and painted red  Jackson trained cadets with these cannon  In 1851  the VMI Board of Visitors was seeking a professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Physics  who could also teach artillery tactics  In February the superintendent of VMI offered Jackson the position at the Institute  which he accepted  A marginal professor of natural philosophy  Jackson proved to be an excellent instructor of artillery  Using the Cadet Battery   six cannon made especially for VMI  Jackson ruled the parade ground  The cannon can still be seen at VMI today  He was a strict taskmaster  with unbending integrity and fearlessness in the discharge of duty  The major was described as being  as exact as a multiplication table and as full of things military as an arsenal    Professor Jackson wore this blue uniform at VMI and at the Battle of Manassas  The coat was recently restored with the greatful support of the Virignia Division of the UDC    If Jackson was exacting in the demands he made upon the cadets  he was no less so in the demands he made upon himself  At VMI  Jackson taught his classes with the same directness with which he thought  He never wavered in his character  in his devoutness to church  his dependability  faith and resolution  These qualities overshadowed any professorial deficiencies and set a standard that even his young cadets recognized as one of greatness  Jackson would become an active business and religious figure in the Lexington community  Finding religious direction from George Junkin  a noted Presbyterian minister who was president of Washington College  he became a member of the Presbyterian Church  During visits at the Junkin household  he fell in love with the youngest daughter Ellie  They were married after a quiet courtship  and they established their life in the Junkin household  It was the happiest time that Jackson had known until then  This happiness was to be short lived when Ellie died during the birth of their first child  Jackson was profoundly grieved and recovered slowly  After a trip to Europe in 1856  he returned home and proposed marriage to Mary Anna Morrison  the daughter of another Presbyterian minister who also happened to be president of a college  Davidson  Thomas and Mary Anna purchased a home on Washington Street  the only home he would ever own  and they became the idealized Victorian couple  In 1859 VMI cadets had an indication of what was to come with the abolitionist John Brown s raid on the federal arsenal at Harper s Ferry  Brown was captured by a detachment of U S  Marines under the command of Colonel Robert E  Lee  USA  At his trial he was found guilty of conspiring to commit treason and was sentenced to be hanged  With fear of another

among the people of Lexington provoked several incidents  one of which resulted in one of Jackson  s few public speeches  One Saturday afternoon attempts were made to raise two flags in Lexington  one for secession and one for remaining in the Union  Lexington had strong Unionist feelings  many of the settlers of the area having come from Pennsylvania  The cadet corps tended toward a strong secessionist sentiment  as many of the cadets were from Tidewater Virginia  Many of them were in the town  as they had been released from duty  Excitement increased when a somewhat violent man drew a
