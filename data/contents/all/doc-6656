Psychology Moderated by Sherri Tombarge  Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Reflections on Life in Nigeria Download pdf Tombarge  James  you also have spent a lot time actually in Nigeria and have just returned  so you ve been there very recently  Gire  Yes  Tombarge  And you ve spent a lot of time sort of working with developing higher education there  and I know you ve noted a real thirst for it  It s a rare commodity  although we were just talking about education in the south  So I guess I m wondering  there must be some people that go to work every day there  that try to live regular lives  and all of this is happening around them  So do you have things to say about what Nigeria s like now  Gire  You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is  I would imagine  one of the most optimistic persons out there  They have ambitions for education  for raising families  for having their children as well as themselves be successful  Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram  a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet  which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important  Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption  particularly in the central government  then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there  To give you an idea   many people view the current government as being   especially when it comes to corruption  A couple of examples will suffice  The president  upon responding to aspects of corruption  will say something like this  Well people are so bent on talking about corruption that they sometimes will label common stealing as corruption  One time he says everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria when you build a very good house  you re viewed as being corrupt  which is surprising because if you re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50 000 naira a month  which is not that much  if you don t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on  and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house  it has to be labeled as something  Where did you get the money from  And then in responding to why  along with India and China and so on  how there is general wealth but there is a lot of poverty in Nigeria  he said Nigeria is not poor because Nigeria is among the top 10 percent in the world in owning private jets  And that is precisely the problem  So people view this as well as the general insecurity as the basis to say we have what it takes  the elements are in place to have a viable  vibrant economy if only we get the right people at the helm to harness this  In their view  and this is the interesting thing  maybe going back to the first thing we discussed  which was Muslim north and Christian south   there is for the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition has developed  Let me tell you why the north used to almost emerge as political leaders any time they had elections  In terms of population  it has more population than the south  But Nigeria has three major components  there s the north  there s the southwest and there s the southeast  The interesting thing is that even though both southwest and southeast were Christian  the predominantly Yoruba southwest and the predominantly Igbo southeast they were not always political partners  So the north would for the most part partner with the southeast and that gave the power    What has changed now the southwest  the second biggest political block to the north is now aligned with the north  Which is why my first comment was I didn t know the current president was favored because the political alliance between the southwest and the north right now is such a gigantic portion of the electorate that I m not sure where the president is going to get his votes from  People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard working people  some of the most resourceful people out there  that the government has been in the way  And therefore if they could only bring in a government that is interested and going to work for the people that their country is just going to go to good places  Hentz  The culture of corruption is persuasive  in Nigeria as it is in other countries  I think at some level  there s a level of if not acceptance of corruption  almost the notion that this is something we have to live with  And I ll give you an interesting anecdotal story  I was traveling back from the Niger Delta to the airport  and we were listening to the Nigerian radio  And they were reporting on the revelation that the president of the Philippines had  100 000 hidden in a bank account   I think the number was  100 000  The two Nigerian announcers started laughing and said   100 000  One of our governors would be embarrassed if they only had  100 000 in their bank account  And it was just the way they joked about it and laughed about it that made you realize that this is something that they deal with on a daily basis and you wonder if they re accepting it  not because they think it s right but because accepting that it s a part of their daily life  With the regions  with the traditional three regions    within each of those regions you have ethnic minorities which are very important  When Nigeria was formed it had three states  Gire  Three regions  Hentz  Three regions  it now has 36 states  and the proliferation of states over time was essentially a way to create what we call in political science  prebends  Prebends are the riches that come with holding office  the more offices you create  the more governorships you create   and I m not even talking about localities   I forget  what are there 180 something local governments  Every government structure you create  whether it s  a  state or what they call  a  locality  is another opportunity to attach prebends  wealth  patronage attached to the office  So not only is there an issue of corruption  there is an issue of institutionalized corruption over the last 30 or 40 years  Gire  That s a very important point  Jim  and I think I ll be more than happy to elaborate  to give you some interesting dimension to that  Yes  corruption has been around forever  in fact almost every military takeover  corruption was one of the reasons cited for the military taking over  but here s what has happened  To some extent it has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on  but it s a matter of magnitude  To give you a sense  it used to be that people who  say you are in charge of awarding contracts and so one and somebody bids for it you might cut some deal with someone to get 10 percent and that was viewed as a horrible thing  And then 10 percent went to maybe like 20 and 30  What has happened right now  which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable    an example will be somebody who holds office has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract maybe for a bridge  100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge  None  Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality  That s the current state  And even for Nigerians  that is too much  Which is why  Muhammadu  Buhari   is out there  Remember  a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians  Buhari s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria  OK  Buhari  when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago  laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there  He said   I was a military general and a head of state  I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me  He said   I have no single foreign bank accounts  None  If you associate any bank account to my name that is not Nigerian  I beg you to bring it forth  He said   I have two houses  one in Kaduna and one in Fantora  I don t have a plot in Abuja  the Nigerian capital  I don t a house in Abuja  He said   If you of anything  bring it forth  No other Nigerian politician who has had opportunity   he was minister of petroleum  he was military president of Nigeria  he was the chair of the petroleum trust fund which was a fund created to use resources from petroleum for capital projects such as roads and big buildings and so forth  And he built roads  This is on record  Nigerians know this  So the only thing if you look at Jonathan s campaign  the only thing is   Buhari cannot memorize his phone number  Buhari is not educated  Buhari is too old  He has not touched in terms of Buhari s integrity  Read the papers about the campaigns  about the issues that have been raised  People are just fed up  In other words  Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption  whereby  20 million have been allotted to build  say  a political science building at the university  you actually see it built  maybe it took  15 million to build it  people say   OK  maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that  To some extent that has been accepted  What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted  When we re talking about corruption  that s the magnitude that has been at work here  So Nigerians have lived with corruption but never with this level that is going

by Sherri Tombarge  Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Reflections on Life in Nigeria Download pdf Tombarge  James  you also have spent a lot time actually in Nigeria and have just returned  so you ve been there very recently  Gire  Yes  Tombarge  And you ve spent a lot of time sort of working with developing higher education there  and I know you ve noted a real thirst for it  It s a rare commodity  although we were just talking about education in the south  So I guess I m wondering  there must be some people that go to work every day there  that try to live regular lives  and all of this is happening around them  So do you have things to say about what Nigeria s like now  Gire  You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is  I would imagine  one of the most optimistic persons out there  They have ambitions for education  for raising families  for having their children as well as themselves be successful  Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram  a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet  which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important  Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption  particularly in the central government  then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there  To give you an idea   many people view the current government as being   especially when it comes to corruption  A couple of examples will suffice  The president  upon responding to aspects of corruption  will say something like this  Well people are so bent on talking about corruption that they sometimes will label common stealing as corruption  One time he says everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria when you build a very good house  you re viewed as being corrupt  which is surprising because if you re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50 000 naira a month  which is not that much  if you don t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on  and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house  it has to be labeled as something  Where did you get the money from  And then in responding to why  along with India and China and so on  how there is general wealth but there is a lot of poverty in Nigeria  he said Nigeria is not poor because Nigeria is among the top 10 percent in the world in owning private jets  And that is precisely the problem  So people view this as well as the general insecurity as the basis to say we have what it takes  the elements are in place to have a viable  vibrant economy if only we get the right people at the helm to harness this  In their view  and this is the interesting thing  maybe going back to the first thing we discussed  which was Muslim north and Christian south   there is for the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition has developed  Let me tell you why the north used to almost emerge as political leaders any time they had elections  In terms of population  it has more population than the south  But Nigeria has three major components  there s the north  there s the southwest and there s the southeast  The interesting thing is that even though both southwest and southeast were Christian  the predominantly Yoruba southwest and the predominantly Igbo southeast they were not always political partners  So the north would for the most part partner with the southeast and that gave the power    What has changed now the southwest  the second biggest political block to the north is now aligned with the north  Which is why my first comment was I didn t know the current president was favored because the political alliance between the southwest and the north right now is such a gigantic portion of the electorate that I m not sure where the president is going to get his votes from  People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard working people  some of the most resourceful people out there  that the government has been in the way  And therefore if they could only bring in a government that is interested and going to work for the people that their country is just going to go to good places  Hentz  The culture of corruption is persuasive  in Nigeria as it is in other countries  I think at some level  there s a level of if not acceptance of corruption  almost the notion that this is something we have to live with  And I ll give you an interesting anecdotal story  I was traveling back from the Niger Delta to the airport  and we were listening to the Nigerian radio  And they were reporting on the revelation that the president of the Philippines had  100 000 hidden in a bank account   I think the number was  100 000  The two Nigerian announcers started laughing and said   100 000  One of our governors would be embarrassed if they only had  100 000 in their bank account  And it was just the way they joked about it and laughed about it that made you realize that this is something that they deal with on a daily basis and you wonder if they re accepting it  not because they think it s right but because accepting that it s a part of their daily life  With the regions  with the traditional three regions    within each of those regions you have ethnic minorities which are very important  When Nigeria was formed it had three states  Gire  Three regions  Hentz  Three regions  it now has 36 states  and the proliferation of states over time was essentially a way to create what we call in political science  prebends  Prebends are the riches that come with holding office  the more offices you create  the more governorships you create   and I m not even talking about localities   I forget  what are there 180 something local governments  Every government structure you create  whether it s  a  state or what they call  a  locality  is another opportunity to attach prebends  wealth  patronage attached to the office  So not only is there an issue of corruption  there is an issue of institutionalized corruption over the last 30 or 40 years  Gire  That s a very important point  Jim  and I think I ll be more than happy to elaborate  to give you some interesting dimension to that  Yes  corruption has been around forever  in fact almost every military takeover  corruption was one of the reasons cited for the military taking over  but here s what has happened  To some extent it has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on  but it s a matter of magnitude  To give you a sense  it used to be that people who  say you are in charge of awarding contracts and so one and somebody bids for it you might cut some deal with someone to get 10 percent and that was viewed as a horrible thing  And then 10 percent went to maybe like 20 and 30  What has happened right now  which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable    an example will be somebody who holds office has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract maybe for a bridge  100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge  None  Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality  That s the current state  And even for Nigerians  that is too much  Which is why  Muhammadu  Buhari   is out there  Remember  a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians  Buhari s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria  OK  Buhari  when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago  laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there  He said   I was a military general and a head of state  I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me  He said   I have no single foreign bank accounts  None  If you associate any bank account to my name that is not Nigerian  I beg you to bring it forth  He said   I have two houses  one in Kaduna and one in Fantora  I don t have a plot in Abuja  the Nigerian capital  I don t a house in Abuja  He said   If you of anything  bring it forth  No other Nigerian politician who has had opportunity   he was minister of petroleum  he was military president of Nigeria  he was the chair of the petroleum trust fund which was a fund created to use resources from petroleum for capital projects such as roads and big buildings and so forth  And he built roads  This is on record  Nigerians know this  So the only thing if you look at Jonathan s campaign  the only thing is   Buhari cannot memorize his phone number  Buhari is not educated  Buhari is too old  He has not touched in terms of Buhari s integrity  Read the papers about the campaigns  about the issues that have been raised  People are just fed up  In other words  Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption  whereby  20 million have been allotted to build  say  a political science building at the university  you actually see it built  maybe it took  15 million to build it  people say   OK  maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that  To some extent that has been accepted  What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted  When we re talking about corruption  that s the magnitude that has been at work here  So Nigerians have lived with corruption but never with this level that is going on at this current time  Copyright   2015 Virginia Military

of time sort of working with developing higher education there  and I know you ve noted a real thirst for it  It s a rare commodity  although we were just talking about education in the south  So I guess I m wondering  there must be some people that go to work every day there  that try to live regular lives  and all of this is happening around them  So do you have things to say about what Nigeria s like now  Gire  You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is  I would imagine  one of the most optimistic persons out there  They have ambitions for education  for raising families  for having their children as well as themselves be successful  Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram  a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet

they sometimes will label common stealing as corruption  One time he says everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria when you build a very good house  you re viewed as being corrupt  which is surprising because if you re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50 000 naira a month  which is not that much  if you don t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on  and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house  it has to be labeled as something  Where did you get the money from  And then in responding to why  along with India and China and so on  how there is general wealth but there is a lot of poverty in Nigeria  he said Nigeria is not poor because Nigeria is among the top 10 percent in the world in owning private jets  And that is precisely the problem  So people view this as well as the general insecurity as the basis to say we have what it takes  the elements are in place to have a viable  vibrant economy if only we get the right people at the helm to harness this  In their view  and this is the interesting thing  maybe going back to the first thing we discussed  which

political partners  So the north would for the most part partner with the southeast and that gave the power    What has changed now the southwest  the second biggest political block to the north is now aligned with the north  Which is why my first comment was I didn t know the current president was favored because the political alliance between the southwest and the north right now is such a gigantic portion of the electorate that I m not sure where the president is going to get his votes from  People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard working people  some

country is just going to go to good places  Hentz  The culture of corruption is persuasive  in Nigeria as it is in other countries  I think at some level  there s a level of if not acceptance of corruption  almost the notion that this is something we have to live with  And I ll give you an interesting anecdotal story  I was traveling back from the Niger Delta to the airport  and we were listening to the Nigerian radio  And they were reporting on the revelation that the president of the Philippines had  100 000 hidden in a bank account   I think the number was  100 000  The two Nigerian announcers started laughing and said   100 000  One of our governors would be embarrassed if they only had  100 000 in their bank account  And it was just the way they joked about it and laughed about it that made you realize that this is something that they deal with on a daily basis and you wonder if they re accepting it  not because they think it s right but because accepting that it s a part of their daily life  With the regions  with the traditional three regions    within each of those regions you have ethnic minorities which are very important  When Nigeria was formed it had three states  Gire  Three regions  Hentz  Three regions  it now has 36 states  and the proliferation of states over time was essentially a way to create what we call in political science  prebends  Prebends are the riches that come with holding office  the more offices you create  the more governorships you create   and I m not even talking about localities   I forget  what are there 180 something local governments  Every government structure you create  whether it s  a  state or what they call  a  locality  is another opportunity to attach prebends  wealth  patronage attached to the office  So not only is there an issue of corruption  there is an issue of institutionalized corruption over the last 30 or 40 years  Gire  That s a very important point  Jim  and I think I ll be more than happy to elaborate  to give you some interesting dimension to that  Yes  corruption has been around forever  in fact almost every military takeover  corruption was one of the reasons cited for the military taking over  but here s what has happened  To some extent it has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on  but it s a matter of magnitude  To give you a sense  it used to be that people who  say you are in charge of awarding contracts and so one and somebody bids for it you might cut some deal with someone to get 10 percent and that was viewed as a horrible thing  And then 10 percent went to maybe like 20 and 30  What has happened right now  which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable    an example will be somebody who holds office has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract maybe for a bridge  100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge  None  Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality  That s the current state  And even for Nigerians  that is too much  Which is why  Muhammadu  Buhari   is out there  Remember  a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians  Buhari s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria  OK  Buhari  when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago  laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there  He said   I was a military general and a head of state  I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me  He said   I have no single foreign bank accounts  None  If you associate any bank account to my name that is not Nigerian  I beg you to bring it forth  He said   I have two houses  one in Kaduna and one in Fantora  I don t have a plot in Abuja  the Nigerian capital  I don t a house in Abuja  He said   If you of anything  bring it forth  No other Nigerian politician who has had opportunity   he was minister of petroleum  he was military president of Nigeria  he was the chair of the petroleum trust fund which was a fund created to use resources from petroleum for capital projects such as roads and big buildings and so forth  And he built roads  This is on record  Nigerians know this  So the only thing if you look at Jonathan s campaign  the only thing is   Buhari cannot memorize his phone number  Buhari is not educated  Buhari is too old  He has not touched in terms of Buhari s integrity  Read the papers about the campaigns  about the issues that have been raised  People are just fed up  In other words  Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption  whereby  20 million have been allotted to build  say  a political science building at the university  you actually see it built  maybe it took  15 million to build it  people say   OK  maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that  To some extent that has been accepted  What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted  When we re talking about corruption  that s the magnitude that has been at work here  So Nigerians have lived with corruption but never with this level that is going on at this current time  Copyright   2015 Virginia Military Institute  For academic and news media use only  No quotes from the

Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Reflections on Life in Nigeria Download pdf Tombarge  James  you also have spent a lot time actually in Nigeria and have just returned  so you ve been there very recently  Gire  Yes  Tombarge  And you ve spent a lot of time sort of working with developing higher education there  and I know you ve noted a real thirst for it  It s a rare commodity  although we were just talking about education in the south  So I guess I m wondering  there must be some people that go to work every day there  that try to live regular lives  and all of this is happening around them  So do you have things to say about what Nigeria s like now  Gire  You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is  I would imagine  one of the most optimistic persons out there  They have ambitions for education  for raising families  for having their children as well as themselves be successful  Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram  a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet  which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important  Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption  particularly in the central government  then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there  To give you an idea   many people view the current government as being   especially when it comes to corruption  A couple of examples will suffice  The president  upon responding to aspects of corruption  will say something like this  Well people are so bent on talking about corruption that they sometimes will label common stealing as corruption  One time he says everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria when you build a very good house  you re viewed as being corrupt  which is surprising because if you re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50 000 naira a month  which is not that much  if you don t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on  and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house  it has to be labeled as something  Where did you get the money from  And then in responding to why  along with India and China and so on  how there is general wealth but there is a lot of poverty in Nigeria  he said Nigeria is not poor because Nigeria is among the top 10 percent in the world in owning private jets  And that is precisely the problem  So people view this as well as the general insecurity as the basis to say we have what it takes  the elements are in place to have a viable  vibrant economy if only we get the right people at the helm to harness this  In their view  and this is the interesting thing  maybe going back to the first thing we discussed  which was Muslim north and Christian south   there is for the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition has developed  Let me tell you why the north used to almost emerge as political leaders any time they had elections  In terms of population  it has more population than the south  But Nigeria has three major components  there s the north  there s the southwest and there s the southeast  The interesting thing is that even though both southwest and southeast were Christian  the predominantly Yoruba southwest and the predominantly Igbo southeast they were not always political partners  So the north would for the most part partner with the southeast and that gave the power    What has changed now the southwest  the second biggest political block to the north is now aligned with the north  Which is why my first comment was I didn t know the current president was favored because the political alliance between the southwest and the north right now is such a gigantic portion of the electorate that I m not sure where the president is going to get his votes from  People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard working people  some of the most resourceful people out there  that the government has been in the way  And therefore if they could only bring in a government that is interested and going to work for the people that their country is just going to go to good places  Hentz  The culture of corruption is persuasive  in Nigeria as it is in other countries  I think at some level  there s a
