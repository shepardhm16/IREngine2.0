Secretary of Education  speaks during the opening session of the STEM education conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV   We Are Being Out Educated  LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  1  2012   The goal of VMI s Science  Technology  Engineering  and Mathematics  or STEM  Education Conference is to solve  America s toughest math problem  The opening session defined that problem as the lack of students concentrating their studies in STEM disciplines  The conference  sponsored by VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  opened today and will run through Wednesday  Oct  3  Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  superintendent  defined the challenge and set the stage for conference participants   We believe that the conversation that happens here this week can serve as a platform for a much needed larger discussion  said Peay  Peay highlighted the hands on STEM learning happening at VMI  including studies in robotics  fractals  and the fourth dimension  but he also emphasized the importance of encouraging and enabling the study of STEM disciplines at an early age   This national problem cannot be solved simply by convincing college students to suddenly major in STEM disciplines  said Peay   The early preparation must take place in the K through 12 classrooms  Following Peay s remarks  Virginia Secretary of Education Laura Fornash offered an overview of the educational challenges the nation faces and the steps the commonwealth is taking to address the issue   Here in the commonwealth  we want to ensure that our children and grandchildren are provided with world class education that will prepare them to be the future scientists  nurses  computer scientists  and teachers  said Fornash   It starts here  It starts with us today  Fornash demonstrated that  as a nation  we are falling behind the rest of the world when it comes to education   Of the 34 most advanced nations in the world  the U S  ranked 17th in science and 25th in math  Simply put  we are being out educated  said Fornash   We have a major problem that requires real leadership  Solving that problem will result in a workforce that can be employed in growing job sectors requiring education in STEM disciplines  John A  Luke Jr  president and CEO of MeadWestvaco Corp  offered an employer s perspective on the education of America s workforce   You know that STEM is not strictly an academic exercise  said Luke   It s about real people learning real skills to get real jobs and have a real impact here in Virginia and across our country   The question  of course  is how do we get there  How do we close the gap  How do we prepare a next generation workforce  I know that the answer begins with everyone here in the auditorium today  Luke ensured participants that industry leaders are committed to supporting the efforts of public leaders to direct attention and resources to STEM education  Addressing the many teachers present in the audience  Luke said   Economic growth in our country depends on what you re doing here today and everyday in your classrooms  Suffice it to say all of us are counting on you  The conference is the first in a series that will bring together students  educators  employers  and policy makers to have a conversation about how to improve STEM education   May your experience this year prompt you to join us next year for a second conference that we know some of you will help us design  said Peay   Together we ll assemble the building blocks and chart the way   By John Robertson IV     VMI  Related Articles State Secretary of Education
