Commonwealth University addresses a breakout session    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  9  2012   In dealing with information security issues  it s vital to know your company  its culture and its appetite for risk  along with factors that can mitigate that risk  in a world in which threats can change daily or even hourly  Stacey Halota  vice president of information security and privacy at the Washington Post Co  shared that message with information security professionals during the Virginia Alliance for Secure Computing and Networking conference held at VMI Oct  9 10  This year s conference  which drew an audience of 145 professionals from higher education  private industry  and government  bore the title   Securing the Future  BYOD and Beyond  BYOD stands for bring your own device   with a device being anything from a laptop computer to an iPad to an Android phone  With the trends of both BYOD and data storage on remote  cloud  servers growing  Halota chose to speak on the topic   BYOD and Cloud  Getting Your House in Order  Halota began her remarks with a stark reminder of how much an information security breach can cost   roughly  5 million per episode  according to a study by the Poneman Institute  Much of Halota s speech focused on the need for information security professionals to be aware of potentially troublesome issues related to cloud storage  Halota reminded her audience that it s critical to know where data is stored  whether on the cloud or off  and how it s backed up  Sometimes  she pointed out  storing data on the cloud doesn t make sense financially when extra security costs are factored in  Furthermore  she noted  cloud storage and data accessibility are affected by a host of federal privacy laws  some applying to all companies and others applying only to specific industries   Every time we do an outsourcing   we have to take a look at the privacy laws  Halota said  Complicating these privacy laws are other laws which mandate that a cloud service provider hand over a company s data in response to a subpoena   and in at least some instances  there is no legal requirement that the company be notified that the data has been handed over to a third party  Halota urged her audience to make sure they had a legal obligation to be notified when data is shared with a third party  It s important to know  who keeps the keys  when sensitive data moves to the cloud  she argued  Halota also spoke about the rising popularity of applications for mobile devices  and the risks  such as viruses  that the use of these applications can present  With 10 9 billion mobile applications downloaded in 2010 alone   This is definitely a huge  booming industry  Halota said  She offered a bevy of questions for her listeners to ponder  such as whether application use should be limited  and whether a company should consider getting a security add on for mobile devices  Halota concluded her remarks with a reminder that educating employees about information security issues should be an ongoing effort  and it can take the form of anything from a brown bag lunch to online training for software developers   Regular communication is critical  she said   Mary Price   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families

information security professionals to be aware of potentially troublesome issues related to cloud storage  Halota reminded her audience that it s critical to know where data is stored  whether on the cloud or off  and how it s backed up  Sometimes  she pointed out  storing data on the cloud doesn t make sense financially when extra security costs are factored in  Furthermore  she noted  cloud storage and data accessibility are affected by a host of federal privacy laws  some applying to all companies and others applying only to specific industries   Every time we do an outsourcing   we have to take a look at the privacy laws  Halota said  Complicating these privacy laws are other laws which mandate that a cloud service provider hand over a company s data in response to a subpoena   and in at least some instances  there is no legal requirement that the company be notified that the data has been handed over to a third party  Halota urged her audience to make sure they had a legal obligation to be notified when data is shared with a third party  It s important to know  who keeps the keys  when sensitive data moves to the cloud  she argued  Halota also spoke about the rising popularity of applications for mobile devices  and the risks  such as viruses  that the use of these applications can present  With 10 9 billion mobile applications downloaded in 2010 alone   This is definitely a huge  booming industry  Halota said  She offered a bevy of questions for her listeners to ponder  such as whether application use should be limited  and whether a company should consider getting a security add on for mobile devices  Halota concluded her remarks with a reminder that educating employees about information security issues should be an ongoing effort  and it can take the form of anything from a brown bag lunch to online training for software developers   Regular communication is critical  she said   Mary Price   VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features
