broadly train students to understand how living organisms function and to appreciate the intricacies and interactions that govern all living systems   This mission supports the broader VMI mission of creating citizen soldiers  by equipping students to make informed decisions that will better society  We accomplish this by providing students with broad training and fundamental background in the biological sciences  while providing the opportunity to specialize in the sub disciplines described under  Academic Concentrations in Biology  Also  we offer in collaboration with the Physical Education Department an Exercise Science minor  The degree programs are particularly good at preparing majors to pursue post graduate education in the biological and health sciences and allow for specialization that matches student interests and career plans  Faculty members believe that interaction with cadets in the classroom  laboratory  and on an individual basis is critical in the development of the successful biology major  In keeping with this philosophy  class sizes are small  laboratories accompany most courses  advising is conducted on an individual basis  and undergraduate research is encouraged  The biology department also provides a summer research experience  The Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program is an intensive ten week program that introduces selected students to the scientific method  research design and data analysis  data presentation  use of sophisticated laboratory instruments  and independent research  Each student conducts a research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor  This research is at the  cutting edge  of science  and student faculty publications have resulted from these projects  Normally  cadets are selected to participate in this program between their second and first class years  Many additional opportunities for undergraduate research exists  allowing students to engage in a one on one interaction with a faculty mentor in their area of interest as early as the summer following the fourth class  freshman  year  B S  Curriculum Common Core Course Requirements All B S  biology majors

mission of the VMI biology department is to broadly train students to understand how living organisms function and to appreciate the intricacies and interactions that govern all living systems   This mission supports the broader VMI mission of creating citizen soldiers  by equipping students to make informed decisions that will better society  We accomplish this by providing students with broad training and fundamental background in the biological sciences  while providing the opportunity to specialize in the sub disciplines described under  Academic Concentrations in Biology  Also  we offer in collaboration with the Physical Education Department an Exercise Science minor  The degree programs are particularly good at preparing majors to pursue post graduate education in the biological and health sciences and allow for specialization that matches student interests and career plans  Faculty members believe that interaction with cadets in the classroom  laboratory  and on an individual basis is critical in the development of the successful biology major  In keeping with this philosophy  class sizes are small  laboratories accompany most courses  advising is conducted on an individual basis  and undergraduate research is encouraged  The biology department also provides a summer research experience  The Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program is an intensive ten week program that introduces selected students to the scientific method  research design and data analysis  data presentation  use of sophisticated laboratory instruments  and independent research  Each student conducts a research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor  This research is at the  cutting edge  of science  and student faculty publications have resulted from these projects  Normally  cadets are selected to participate in this program between their second and first class years  Many additional opportunities for undergraduate research exists  allowing students to engage in a one on one interaction with a faculty mentor in their area of interest as early as the summer following the fourth class  freshman  year  B S  Curriculum Common Core Course Requirements All B S

department is to broadly train students to understand how living organisms function and to appreciate the intricacies and interactions that govern all living systems   This mission supports the broader VMI mission of creating citizen soldiers  by equipping students to make informed decisions that will better society  We accomplish this by providing students with broad training and fundamental background in the biological sciences  while providing the opportunity to specialize in the sub disciplines described under  Academic Concentrations in Biology  Also  we offer in collaboration with the Physical Education Department an Exercise Science minor  The degree programs are particularly good at preparing majors to pursue post graduate education in the biological and health sciences and allow for specialization that matches student interests and career plans  Faculty members believe that interaction with cadets in the classroom  laboratory  and on an individual basis is critical in the development of the successful biology major  In keeping with this philosophy  class sizes are small  laboratories accompany most courses  advising is conducted on an individual basis  and undergraduate research is encouraged  The biology department also provides a summer research experience  The Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program is an intensive ten week program that introduces selected students to the scientific method  research design and data analysis  data presentation  use of sophisticated laboratory instruments  and independent research  Each student conducts a research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor  This research is at the  cutting edge  of science  and student faculty publications have resulted from these projects

train students to understand how living organisms function and to appreciate the intricacies and interactions that govern all living systems   This mission supports the broader VMI mission of creating citizen soldiers  by equipping students to make informed decisions that will better society  We accomplish this by providing students with broad training and fundamental background in the biological sciences  while providing the opportunity to specialize in the sub disciplines described under  Academic Concentrations in Biology  Also  we offer in collaboration with the Physical Education Department an Exercise Science minor  The degree programs are particularly good at preparing majors to pursue post graduate education in the biological and health sciences and allow for specialization that matches student interests and career plans  Faculty members believe that interaction with cadets in the classroom  laboratory  and on an individual basis is critical in the development of the successful biology major  In keeping with this philosophy  class sizes are small  laboratories accompany most courses  advising is conducted on an individual basis  and undergraduate research is encouraged  The biology department also provides a summer research experience  The Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program is an intensive ten week program that introduces selected students to the scientific method  research design and data analysis  data presentation  use of sophisticated laboratory instruments  and independent research  Each student conducts a research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor  This research is at the  cutting edge  of science  and student faculty publications have resulted from these projects  Normally  cadets are selected to participate in this program between their second and first class years  Many additional opportunities for undergraduate research exists  allowing students to engage in a one on one interaction with a faculty mentor
