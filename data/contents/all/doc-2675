by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  July 9  2015   As owner of the Chessie Nature Trail  VMI is responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the 7 mile jaunt from Lexington and Buena Vista  Among many projects Physical Plant staff have taken on are a series of improvements to the Chessie Trail funded by a federal grant  The Federal Highway Administration recently awarded a Recreation Trail Program Grant to VMI  The  79 000 grant  which is administered through the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  will go a long way toward making the popular trail much safer and more user friendly  The grant will also make it possible for VMI to improve several identified deficiencies on the trail   VMI is committed to 20 percent  explained Maj  Jenny deHart  former staff engineer and sustainability coordinator at VMI s physical plant  and a staunch advocate for the Chessie Trail   The other 80 percent is reimbursed  For  15 000 we   get  80 000 worth of work  I m pretty psyched about this  Some of the work paid for by the grant has already begun  and though it took four years to secure the grant  all of the work must be completed in two years  The folks at VMI have their work cut out for them  First  there are plans to upgrade the gate systems that dot the trail itself as well as those that allow vehicular access  Currently  there are eight gates along the trail  few  if any  of them are adequate  Most of them need an upgrade to make them more user friendly  granting  as unfettered access as possible to a wide range of users  said deHart  At the same time  these gates have to work for the land owners along the trail  who often complain of unthinking guests leaving the gates open and allowing cattle to stray  Entry points along the trail allow maintenance and emergency vehicles access to the trail  but they are in need of work as well  DeHart explained that a system of bollards   evenly spaced upright posts   is being considered to rectify that situation   There are places where we currently have gates which are strictly to keep vehicular traffic to a minimum  said deHart   Bollards would be a good option there  Any emergency or farm vehicles can just move one of those bollards and drive in  As plans for gates go forward  work has already begun on adding signs  New trailhead signs going up in three locations will include basic trail information  regulations  and a map  More signs designating private property  warning of rock fall  and even pointing out an endangered species of flower that was recently discovered on the trail have gone up  too  Also on tap for maintenance crews this summer is a partial resurfacing of the trail  According to Jackson  J B  Harris  a grounds foreman with the physical plant and the man in charge of routine trail maintenance  plans are to lay down a ton of a gravel and sand mix this summer to begin work on resurrecting the old surface  That is not enough for the entire seven miles of trail  said deHart  but it is a start   We are hoping to use a new  finer trail surface in selected locations that will help with proper drainage  said deHart  noting that drainage is another important area covered by the grant   It will also help with the concept of firm and stable  which is required for universal access  Bridge repairs are already underway as well  and down the road  VMI hopes to use some of the grant money to improve parking areas for users of the trail   There is very little official  permanent parking for the trail  especially toward the Lexington end  deHart said   The places where people park now are not on VMI property  plus  some of the parking requires people to cross the road  which can be dangerous  Plans are to construct two parking areas  The first will be in the area designated the  industrial zone  near East Lexington about one half mile along the trail  VMI owns a building in that area  and when it is moved  a parking area with 10 spaces  including a handicapped space  will take its place  The other parking area will be placed about five miles in  on the east side of South River   These are pretty important things  said deHart   These are the unglorious things you have to do to make a trail safe  DeHart will not see this work completed  however  She recently left VMI to become the sustainability director at Unity College in Unity  Maine  She is confident that the work on the Chessie Trail will continue unabated   Whoever takes this over has a lot of work ahead of them  she said   But  whoever comes after me will be able to  I hope  pick it up right where we left off  The grant work seeks to improve user access to the Chessie Trail from end to end as part of a master plan for the Brushy Blue Greenway  Eventually the Chessie will be the central   and longest   piece of a trail that will run from Brushy Hills through Lexington to Buena Vista  along the riverwalk and through Buena Vista to connect with the Appalachian Trail
