Berlin Wall reveals  utility of studying history  As America celebrates Veteran s Day  and VMI marks its 175th anniversary with a host of events  another important anniversary passed this weekend  the 25 year anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall  The event was marked in Berlin with a ceremony  balloons  and speeches by Angela Merkel  current German Chancellor   and by the last leader of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  Former General Secretary of the USSR and the man who bears a lot of the responsibility for the wall s collapse  Mikhail Gorbachev  warned of the possibility of a new Cold War between Russia and the West  and criticized the triumphalist attitude in the West for the escalation in tensions  His speech reflects a growing rift between Russia and the U S  one that has coincided with Putin s consolidation of power in Russia since 2000  The 25 year anniversary of the Berlin Wall s fall has also sparked a reexamination among historians of the causes  For example  Mary

or strategy  The Adams Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis hosted a conference last week  The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs during the Reagan Presidency that focused in a large part on Reagan s role in ending the Cold War  Several of the sessions dissected the end of the Cold War  both from Reagan s and from Gorbachev s perspective  and the general scholarly consensus was that the Cold War was not an American victory  but a mutually beneficial negotiated settlement between the US and the USSR  or more specifically  their leaders Ronald Reagan

between the USSR and US to succeed  and Jack Matlock Jr  stressed that the break up of the Soviet Union in late 1991 was neither a goal of US policy  nor was it anticipated by American policymakers  Unfortunately it seems that historians have been ignored  and today  the wrong lessons are being taken from the events of the late 1980s Many look at Reagan s famous 1987 speech where he said  Mr  Gorbachev  tear down this wall  and because the wall came down little more than two years later  assume that Reagan s rhetoric caused the collapse of the Berlin Wall  However  as argued above  historians have concluded that the fall of the wall was much more the result of chance   the East German leadership s ineptitude  Gorbachev s reforms  and the power and determination of East German protesters  The Adams Center strives to encourage innovative scholarship on the Cold War and to stress the utility of studying history in order to craft wise policies in the contemporary world  To summarize the main ideas of last week s conference  the enduring legacy of President Reagan is his determination to reach a negotiated end to the Cold War his belief and pursuit of a nuclear free world  and his ability to realize that his abhorrence for communism had to take a back seat to accepting the Soviet Union as a legitimate state  It is important for the American public  as well as policymakers  to start paying attention to these historical lessons  and more generally  to draw the correct lessons from history  Only then can more critical questions be effectively debated  such

of the Berlin Wall Really Happened  The National Security Archive put together key documents showing that the fall of the Berlin Wall  came about from accident and contingency  rather than conspiracy or strategy  The Adams Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis hosted a conference last week  The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs during the Reagan Presidency that focused in a large part on Reagan s role in ending the Cold War  Several of the sessions dissected the end of the Cold War  both from Reagan s and from Gorbachev s perspective  and the general scholarly consensus was that the Cold War was not an American victory  but a mutually beneficial negotiated settlement between the US and the USSR  or more specifically  their leaders Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  Ambassador Jack Matlock Jr  one of the architects of the negotiations with the USSR  spoke at the conference and ambassador Rozanne Ridgeway  chief U S  negotiator  chaired the panel on the U S  and the Soviet Union  Numerous other scholars  including Lou Cannon  James Wilson  US State Dept  Svetlana Savranskaya  National Security Archive  Jacob Kipp  University of Kansas  Beth Fischer  University of Toronto  and Archie Brown  Oxford University  directly addressed the end of the Cold War  Beth Fischer mentioned the importance that luck played in allowing negotiations between the USSR and US to succeed  and Jack Matlock Jr  stressed that the break up of the Soviet Union in late 1991 was neither a goal of US policy  nor was it anticipated by American policymakers  Unfortunately it seems that historians have been ignored  and today  the wrong lessons are being taken from the events of the late 1980s Many look at Reagan s famous 1987 speech where he said  Mr  Gorbachev  tear down this wall  and because the wall came down little more than two years later  assume that Reagan s rhetoric caused the collapse of the Berlin Wall  However  as argued above  historians have concluded that the fall of the wall was much more the result of chance   the East German leadership s ineptitude  Gorbachev s reforms  and the power and determination of East German protesters  The Adams Center strives to encourage innovative scholarship on the Cold War and to stress the utility of studying history in order to craft wise policies in the contemporary world  To summarize the main ideas of last week s conference  the enduring legacy of President Reagan is his determination to reach a negotiated end to the Cold War his belief and pursuit of a nuclear free world  and his ability to realize that his abhorrence for communism had to take a back seat to accepting the Soviet Union as a legitimate state  It is important for the American public  as well as policymakers  to start paying attention to these historical lessons  and more generally  to draw the correct lessons from history  Only then can more critical questions be effectively debated  such how the Berlin Wall s fall affected Europe  and how understandings of Europe are still being contested  for example on the battlefields of Eastern Ukraine and in Hungary s political arena     Note

a lot of the responsibility for the wall s collapse  Mikhail Gorbachev  warned of the possibility of a new Cold War between Russia and the West  and criticized the triumphalist attitude in the West
