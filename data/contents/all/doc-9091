Maximmum input current  Ideally zero  3  Maximum current that the output can sink  Ideally infinite  The devices are open collector or open drain and therefore cannot source any current  4  How close to ground the output voltage can go  Ideally zero  often one diode drop above  5  The maximum output voltage  Since comparators are open collector or open drain  the output is in a high impedance state when the device is  on  so the output must be pulled up with a resistor  There is a maximum voltage that the output pin can be pulled up to without damaging the device  6  The chip must be powered from supplies between these two extremes  Digital to Analog Converters device bits data1 Vlow2 Vhigh3 multiplying4 Tconversion AD557 8 parallel 0V 2 56V no 1us DAC03830 8 parallel  10V5 10V5

rare 3 Other devices  external link  Notes 1  Unlike conventional CMOS inputs that are designed to operate with relatively clean digital signals and suffer from output jitter and large current drains when faced with a non logic input such as 2 5V  Schmitt inputs work well with analog inputs in the range of 0V to 5V  and display hysteresis  2  OK  this is a TTL and not a CMOS chip  but since it accepts CMOS inputs and it outputs directly to an LED display it works fine in an otherwise CMOS circuit  3  Write only memory can be written to  but not read from  This particular device has an excellent number of socket insertions to number of pins remaining characteristic  Filters Device SC A1 Order2 Purpose3 Type4 Vin5 Fmin6 Fmax Comments MAX274 A 8 BP  LP BW  BL  C1  5V 0Hz 150kHz MAX280

amplifiers  to amplify small differential signals that ride upon large and possibly varying common mode signals  especially when the source impedance of the signal is high encouraging capacitive coupling of 60Hz powerline and radiofrequency noise  2  The output voltage swing is usually not rail to rail  i e  cannot go entirely between the low and high chip supply voltages  Vswing limit refers to how close the output voltages can approach the positive and negative voltage supply rails  e g  an AD620 powered from 0 and 5V can have an output that varies from 1 2 to 3 8V  Miscellaneous Device

high chip supply voltages  Vswing limit refers to how close the output voltages can approach the positive and negative voltage supply rails  e g  an AD741 powered from  5V and 5V can have an output that varies from  3 9V to 3 9V  R R  or Rail to rail  means that the output voltage can swing anywhere between the two power supply rails  i e  same as specifying a Vswing limit   Vsupply   0V

ripple and won t inject noise in the system  They work by reducing the difference between the input and output voltage as heat  so they often require heat sinks  Switch mode power supplies work by turning on and off typically hundreds of thousands of times each second  They dissipate much less power  but introduce typically 10mV to 100mV of ripple into the output  2  Some chips have a pin that indicates if the output is in regulation or not  3  Vd is the dropout voltage  the minimum voltage that the input must exceed the output for the output to be regulated  It is a strong function of output current  4  2 5V and 3 3V versions are also available  5  A ground splitter takes a ground and a Vcc supply  and creates a new supply output at Vcc 2  This is typically used as a virtual ground  giving the user  Vcc 2 and the virtual ground supplies
