EE115 EE115  Introduction to ECE Home Teaching EE115 EE223 EE230 EE431 EE455 EE491 2 EE115 taught by COL James Squire is one section of a series of six 0 5 credit hour modules instructed by different ECE faculty members designed to introduce students to the breadth of the electrical and computer engineering discipline  Modules provide hands on training with ECE equipment  including computer hardware and software packages  ECE topics and training are reinforced across multiple modules to emphasize intra disciplinary connections   1 credit hour  Lecture Schedule In the following table  the homework is assigned on the day listed and due at the start of the following lesson  CP stands for  collaborative problems  and are not collected or graded  they are solved problems either worked in class or available for the student to study out of class that illustrate problems of the type assigned for homework  If you are confident with the homework  you don t need to do them  If you are
