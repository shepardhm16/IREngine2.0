session of the 2013 VMI STEM Education Conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  STEM Conference Opens with Glimpses at Cutting Edge Research in Neuroscience LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  8  2013   More than 250 high school students  faculty  and administrators from across Virginia joined VMI faculty members to hear about cutting edge research in neuroscience this morning as the 2013 VMI STEM Education Conference kicked off  The three year series of STEM conferences is aimed at preparing high school students for careers in the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  Last year  the inaugural conference had mathematics as its focus  This year  the theme of the conference is   Science with the Future in Mind  With that theme as their backdrop  the opening speakers  both neuroscientists  used the occasion of the STEM conference to speak about advances in their field and how better understanding of the structure and functioning of the human brain could have vast implications for everything from preventing war to curing disease  Addressing the conference participants were Dr  William Casebeer  program manager in the Defense Sciences Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  better known as DARPA  and Dr  Amy Bernard  director of structured science at the Allen Institute of Brain Science in Seattle  Wash  Casebeer  a 24 year veteran of the U S  Air Force who specializes in neuroethics and military ethics  began his remarks by introducing President Barack Obama s BRAIN Initiative  which the White House unveiled in April  The  100 million program  whose name stands for Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies  charges DARPA  the National Institutes of Health  and the National Science Foundation with coming to a more sophisticated understanding of the structure and functioning of the human brain  Casebeer explained that through his work at DARPA  he and his colleagues aim to further the president s BRAIN Initiative by understanding  augmenting  restoring  and emulating the human brain  To that end  they are using multiple avenues to explore the functioning of what Casebeer termed the  three pound universe  sitting atop everyone s shoulders  The brain  he noted  can still  outperform the fastest supercomputer on the face of the globe  Casebeer and his fellow researchers are turning to one of the oldest forms of the communication known to man  the story   Stories and narratives have a powerful influence on human behavior  Casebeer noted   We know that stories and narratives influence the way we reason   so  we should treat them as a resource for our war fighters  As an example of the power of a narrative  Casebeer asked his audience to consider the  trolley problem  of moral philosophy  An out of control trolley is coming down the track toward a group of five children playing there  directly in the trolley s path  The children are too far away to hear a shouted warning from an onlooker  but at the onlooker s feet is a switch that  if flipped  will divert the trolley away from the five children  but onto a track where a single child is playing  The scientist then asked the members of the audience to raise their hands if they would divert the trolley  About 60 percent of the audience raised their hands  using what Casebeer termed  utilitarian reasoning  to calculate the consequences  Next  Casebeer told a story involving an almost identical situation   except that this time  an out of control train is approaching a footbridge  and if a child is pushed off the bridge  the train will slow down and the people on the train will be saved  When asked how many would push the child out of the way  only a handful of people raised their hands  The language and structure of narrative  said Casebeer  are set up differently in each story  in order to prime the audience to reach a different conclusion   Now philosophers have gone round and round trying to draw a principal distinction between these two cases  the DARPA scientist observed  The difference  he noted  is that the language and structure of narrative in the first story calls upon areas of the brain that have to do with calculation of consequences  while the second brings up processing of emotions and theory of mind  which involves making inferences about the mental states of others  Continuing the discussion of brain functioning was Bernard  a molecular neuroscientist whose employer  the Allen Institute  is also involved with Obama s BRAIN Initiative  Bernard began her remarks by pointing out that neuroscience is not a new field   and to illustrate her point  she showed a slide of a remarkably prescient drawing of a brain by Leonardo da Vinci  dated 1508  Likewise  Bernard pointed out that neuroscience is not one field but a conglomeration of several  including chemistry  linguistics  computer science  and philosophy   This interdisciplinary field really does require all of these other fields to come together  she noted  With contributions pouring in from all of those areas of study  there is no shortage of information  Research about the brain  Bernard noted  is coming in at a torrid pace  with a new scientific paper being published every 20 seconds   Genius is a community based phenomenon  she stated  Thanks to this wealth of findings  and plethora of contributors  a  big science  approach is enabling Bernard and other researchers to learn more about the brain s structure and functioning  Because of this  she observed  we are coming closer to understanding how the parts of the brain fit together  how they receive and store information  and what goes wrong in disease  Like Casebeer  Bernard used the analogy of a computer to help her audience grasp the workings of the brain   Everyone has a big  wet computer  observed Bernard  who holds a doctorate in genetics and biophysics from the University of Colorado  That computer  she added  holds 100 billion neurons and 100 000 miles of blood vessels  Together  those help to process 70 000 thoughts a day  After their presentations  Casebeer and Bernard sat down with Col  Jim Turner  65  VMI professor of biology  to take questions from the audience before a scheduled lunch break  One audience member asked Bernard if the human genome project had yielded any information about how many genes are active in the brain  The Allen Institute scientist replied that approximately 80 percent of human genes are active there   This is a lot higher than we thought  she said  Another questioner asked Bernard how her work on the molecular level would have an impact in the real world  Bernard s answer revealed a good bit about how discoveries in science actually advance learning in the field  In the short term  she acknowledged  her work doesn t contribute much   Discoveries get built over a long period of time  she remarked   In science  you re often in it for the long haul  It can take dozens or hundreds of years to see the impact of something    Longer term  what we do is generate a lot of primary information that can be a foundational groundwork  This year s STEM conference is purposely small  at least by the standards of its predecessor  because the event s organizers wanted to make sure students got a hands on approach to science  explained Capt  Beth Stefanik  communications specialist with VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics   We made this year s STEM conference smaller by design  Stefanik said   We went to a workshop based format  and also

Casebeer addresses conference participants during the opening session of the 2013 VMI STEM Education Conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  STEM Conference Opens with Glimpses at Cutting Edge Research in Neuroscience LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  8  2013   More than 250 high school students  faculty  and administrators from across Virginia joined VMI faculty members to hear about cutting edge research in neuroscience this morning as the 2013 VMI STEM Education Conference kicked off  The three year series of STEM conferences is aimed at preparing high school students for careers in the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  Last year  the inaugural conference had mathematics as its focus  This year  the theme of the conference is   Science with the Future in Mind  With that theme as their backdrop  the opening speakers  both neuroscientists  used the occasion of the STEM conference to speak about advances in their field and how better understanding of the structure and functioning of the human brain could have vast implications for everything from preventing war to curing disease  Addressing the conference participants were Dr  William Casebeer  program manager in the Defense Sciences Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  better known as DARPA  and Dr  Amy Bernard  director of structured science at the Allen Institute of Brain Science in Seattle  Wash  Casebeer  a 24 year veteran of the U S  Air Force who specializes in neuroethics and military ethics  began his remarks by introducing President Barack Obama s BRAIN Initiative  which the White House unveiled in April  The  100 million program  whose name stands for Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies  charges DARPA  the National Institutes of Health  and the National Science Foundation with coming to a more sophisticated understanding of the structure and functioning of the human brain  Casebeer explained that through his work at DARPA  he and his colleagues aim to further the president s BRAIN Initiative by understanding  augmenting  restoring  and emulating the human brain  To that end  they are using multiple avenues to explore the functioning of what Casebeer termed the  three pound universe  sitting atop everyone s shoulders  The brain  he noted  can still  outperform the fastest supercomputer on the face of the globe  Casebeer and his fellow researchers are turning to one of the oldest forms of the communication known to man  the story   Stories and narratives have a powerful influence on human behavior  Casebeer noted   We know that stories and narratives influence the way we reason   so  we should treat them as a resource for our war fighters  As an example of the power of a narrative  Casebeer asked his audience to consider the  trolley problem  of moral philosophy  An out of control trolley is coming down the track toward a group of five children playing there  directly in the trolley s path  The children are too far away to hear a shouted warning from an onlooker  but at the onlooker s feet is a switch that  if flipped  will divert the trolley away from the five children  but onto a track where a single child is playing  The scientist then asked the members of the audience to raise their hands if they would divert the trolley  About 60 percent of the audience raised their hands  using what Casebeer termed  utilitarian reasoning  to calculate the consequences  Next  Casebeer told a story involving an almost identical situation   except that this time  an out of control train is approaching a footbridge  and if a child is pushed off the bridge  the train will slow down and the people on the train will be saved  When asked how many would push the child out of the way  only a handful of people raised their hands  The language and structure of narrative  said Casebeer  are set up differently in each story  in order to prime the audience to reach a different conclusion   Now philosophers have gone round and round trying to draw a principal distinction between these two cases  the DARPA scientist observed  The difference  he noted  is that the language and structure of narrative in the first story calls upon areas of the brain that have to do with calculation of consequences  while the second brings up processing of emotions and theory of mind  which involves making inferences about the mental states of others  Continuing the discussion of brain functioning was Bernard  a molecular neuroscientist whose employer  the Allen Institute  is also involved with Obama s BRAIN Initiative  Bernard began her remarks by pointing out that neuroscience is not a new field   and to illustrate her point  she showed a slide of a remarkably prescient drawing of a brain by Leonardo da Vinci  dated 1508  Likewise  Bernard pointed out that neuroscience is not one field but a conglomeration of several  including chemistry  linguistics  computer science  and philosophy   This interdisciplinary field really does require all of these other fields to come together  she noted  With contributions pouring in from all of those areas of study  there is no shortage of information  Research about the brain  Bernard noted  is coming in at a torrid pace  with a new scientific paper being published every 20 seconds   Genius is a community based phenomenon  she stated  Thanks to this wealth of findings  and plethora of contributors  a  big science  approach is enabling Bernard and other researchers to learn more about the brain s structure and functioning  Because of this  she observed  we are coming closer to understanding how the parts of the brain fit together  how they receive and store information  and what goes wrong in disease  Like Casebeer  Bernard used the analogy of a computer to help her audience grasp the workings of the brain   Everyone has a big  wet computer  observed Bernard  who holds a doctorate in genetics and biophysics from the University of Colorado  That computer  she added  holds 100 billion neurons and 100 000 miles of blood vessels  Together  those help to process 70 000 thoughts a day  After their presentations  Casebeer and Bernard sat down with Col  Jim Turner  65  VMI professor of biology  to take questions from the audience before a scheduled lunch break  One audience member asked Bernard if the human genome project had yielded any information about how many genes are active in the brain  The Allen Institute scientist replied that approximately 80 percent of human genes are active there   This is a lot higher than we thought  she said  Another questioner asked Bernard how her work on the molecular level would have an impact in the real world  Bernard s answer revealed a good bit about how discoveries in science actually advance learning in the field  In the short term  she acknowledged  her work doesn t contribute much   Discoveries get built over a long period of time  she remarked   In science  you re often in it for the long haul  It can take dozens or hundreds of years to see the impact of something    Longer term  what we do is generate a lot of primary information that can be a foundational groundwork  This year s STEM conference is purposely small  at least by the standards of its predecessor  because the event s organizers wanted to make sure

Conference Opens with Glimpses at Cutting Edge Research in Neuroscience LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  8  2013   More than 250 high school students  faculty  and administrators from across Virginia joined VMI faculty members to hear about cutting edge research in neuroscience this morning as the 2013 VMI STEM Education Conference kicked off  The three year series of STEM conferences is aimed at preparing high school students for careers in the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  Last year  the inaugural conference had mathematics as its focus  This year  the theme of the conference is   Science with the Future in Mind  With that theme as their backdrop  the opening speakers  both neuroscientists  used the occasion of the STEM conference to speak about advances in their field and how better understanding of the structure and functioning of the human brain could have vast implications for everything from preventing war to curing disease  Addressing the conference participants were Dr  William Casebeer  program manager in the Defense Sciences Office at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  better known as DARPA  and Dr  Amy Bernard  director of structured science at the Allen Institute of Brain Science in Seattle  Wash  Casebeer  a 24 year veteran of the U S  Air Force who specializes in neuroethics and military ethics  began his remarks by introducing President Barack Obama s BRAIN Initiative  which the White House unveiled in April  The  100 million program  whose name stands for Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies  charges DARPA  the National Institutes of Health  and the National Science Foundation with coming to a more sophisticated understanding of the structure and functioning of the human brain  Casebeer explained that through his work at DARPA  he and his colleagues aim to further the president s BRAIN Initiative by understanding  augmenting  restoring  and emulating the human brain  To that end  they are using multiple avenues to explore the functioning of what Casebeer termed the  three pound universe  sitting atop everyone s shoulders  The brain  he noted  can still  outperform the fastest supercomputer on the face of the globe  Casebeer and his fellow researchers are turning to one of the oldest forms of the communication known to man  the story   Stories and narratives have a powerful influence on human behavior  Casebeer noted   We know that stories and narratives influence the way we reason   so  we should treat them as a resource for our war fighters  As an example of the power of a narrative  Casebeer asked his audience to consider the  trolley problem  of moral philosophy  An out of control trolley is coming down the track toward a group of five children playing there  directly in the trolley s path  The children are too far away to hear a shouted warning from an onlooker  but at the onlooker s feet is a switch that  if flipped  will divert the trolley away from the five children  but onto a track where a single child is playing  The scientist then asked the members of the audience to raise their hands if they would divert the trolley  About 60 percent of the audience raised their hands  using what Casebeer termed  utilitarian reasoning  to calculate the consequences  Next  Casebeer told a story involving an almost identical situation   except that this time  an out of control train is approaching a footbridge  and if a child is pushed off the bridge  the train will slow down and the people on the train will be saved  When asked how many would push the child out of the way  only a handful of people raised their hands  The language and structure of narrative  said Casebeer  are set up differently in each story  in order to prime the audience to reach a different conclusion   Now philosophers have gone round and round trying to draw a principal distinction between these two cases  the DARPA scientist observed  The difference  he noted  is that the language and structure of narrative in the first story calls upon areas of the brain that have to do with calculation of consequences  while the second brings up processing of emotions and theory of mind  which involves making inferences about the mental states of others  Continuing the discussion of brain functioning was Bernard  a molecular neuroscientist whose employer  the Allen Institute  is also involved with Obama s BRAIN Initiative  Bernard began her remarks by pointing out that neuroscience is not a new field   and to illustrate her point  she showed a slide of a remarkably prescient drawing of a brain by Leonardo da Vinci  dated 1508  Likewise  Bernard pointed out that neuroscience is not one field but a conglomeration of several  including chemistry  linguistics  computer science  and philosophy   This interdisciplinary field really does require all of these other fields to come together  she noted  With contributions pouring in from all of those areas of study  there is no shortage of information  Research about the brain  Bernard noted  is coming in at a torrid pace  with a new scientific paper being published every 20 seconds   Genius is a community based phenomenon  she stated  Thanks to this wealth of findings  and plethora of contributors  a  big science  approach is enabling Bernard and other researchers to learn more about the brain s structure and functioning  Because of this  she observed  we are coming closer to understanding how the parts of the brain fit together  how they receive and store information  and what goes wrong in disease  Like Casebeer  Bernard used the analogy of a computer to help her audience grasp the workings of the brain   Everyone has a big  wet computer  observed Bernard  who holds a doctorate in genetics and biophysics from the University of Colorado  That computer  she added  holds 100 billion neurons and 100 000 miles of blood vessels  Together  those help to process 70 000 thoughts a day  After their presentations  Casebeer and Bernard sat down with Col  Jim Turner  65  VMI professor of biology  to take questions from the audience before a scheduled lunch break  One audience member asked Bernard if the human genome project had yielded any information about how many genes are active in the brain  The Allen Institute scientist replied that approximately 80 percent of human genes are active there   This is a lot higher than we thought  she said  Another questioner asked Bernard how her work on the molecular level would have an impact in the real world  Bernard s answer revealed a good bit about how discoveries in science actually advance learning in the field  In the short term  she acknowledged  her work doesn t contribute much   Discoveries get built over a long period of time  she remarked   In science  you re often in it for the long haul  It can take dozens or hundreds of years to see the impact of something    Longer term  what we do is generate a lot of primary information that can be a foundational groundwork  This year s STEM conference is purposely small  at least by the standards of its predecessor  because the event s organizers wanted to make sure students got a hands on approach to science  explained Capt  Beth Stefanik  communications specialist with VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics   We made this year s STEM conference smaller by design  Stefanik said   We went to a workshop based format  and also supported high school student attendance via grants  With that goal in mind  36 small group sessions are scheduled for Wednesday  Oct  9  with many of them to be led by VMI faculty members from a variety of STEM disciplines    Mary Price  VMI The  Three Pound Universe Dr  William Casebeer
