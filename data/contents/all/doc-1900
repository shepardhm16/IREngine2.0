Friendly Page Course Numbering System  Each subject is identified by a symbol made up of two parts  The first part is an abbreviation denoting the field of study  The second part is a number denoting the particular subject  The first digit indicates the year in which the course is taken and  therefore  the level of instruction  Credit  The unit of academic credit used at the Virginia Military Institute is the semester hour A semester hour represents one hour of classroom work  lecture or recitation  or one period  two or three hours  of laboratory or supervised research or field work per week during a single semester  Thus a course that meets for three class hours and one laboratory period each week during one semester usually carries credit for four semester hours  In the following course descriptions the figures on the title lines indicate  in order  the class hours per week  the laboratory or field work hours per week  and the semester hours credit  For example  the figures  3 2 4  mean that the class meets three times a week for one hour classroom sessions and has two hours of laboratory  supervised research  or field work each week  and that the course carries four
