Orders No  19   I  The Supt  communicates the following dispatch received from the Adj t Gen l Richmond  Va  May 16  1864 Maj  Gen l  F  H  Smith  March the Cadets to Richmond and report to Sec  of War Copy of his letter of to day to the Governor The signal victory just achieved by Gen l Breckinridge in the Valley with the retreat of the enemies  forces that lately threatened along the line of the Va  and Tenn  Rail Road  and relieved forces acting as reserves in the quarter  while on the other hand all  our  reserved forces at command would be entirely serviceable in strengthening our defenses and enabling us to send veteran troops to the Battle Field  Under these circumstances I have thought the gallant Corps of Cadets at the Institute  might be most advantageously summoned here  Where else could they more appropriately signalize their valor and patriotism than in the defense of the Capitol of their native State  I therefore venture on the suggestion and make the request that they be called here to aid in defense of the Capitol and within the entrenchments or in guarding some of our most important lines of communications as circumstances may require   Signed  J  A  Seddon

Supt  Va  Mil  Institute  General The Corps of Cadets having been by order of the President turned over to the State authority and the movements of the enemy appearing to involve the safety of the Institute and other public property at Lexington  the Governor directs that you cause the Corps to be returned to the Institute by Railroad  via Lynchburg  or other route if found more practicable The Governor approves the order of Ex Governor Letcher of 4th Sept  1863 and adopts it so far as at present applicable Should the public property at the Institute be found unmolested and practicable to be reached and defended  you will adopt proper measures for that purpose In the event of difficulty or peril in making that defense except by co operation with the troops of the Confederate Government  it will be needful to afford that co operation  at least to such extent as the security of the Military Institute may require   of which you must of necessity be the judge  Bearing in mind however always  that the Corps be not further exposed in battle than absolute necessity may require By Command  Wm  H  Richardson  Adjt  Gen l VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI
