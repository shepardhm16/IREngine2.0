Morrison  A  A  V  M  Inst  Headquarters Va  Military Institute Staunton  May 21  1864 General Orders No  19  I  The Supt  communicates the following dispatch received from the Adj t Gen l  Richmond  Va  May 16  1864 Maj  Gen l  F  H  Smith March the Cadets to Richmond and report to Sec  of War   Copy of his letter of to day to the Governor   The signal victory just achieved by Gen l Breckinridge in the Valley with the retreat of the enemies  forces that lately threatened along the line of the Va  and Tenn  Rail Road  and relieved forces acting as reserves in the quarter  while on the other hand all  our  reserved forces at command would be entirely serviceable in strengthening our defenses and enabling us to send veteran troops to the Battle Field  Under these circumstances I have thought the gallant Corps of Cadets at the Institute  might be most advantageously summoned here  Where else could they more appropriately signalize their valor and patriotism than in the defense of the Capitol of their native State  I therefore venture on the suggestion and make the request that they be called here to aid in defense of the Capitol and within the entrenchments or in guarding some of our most important lines of communications as circumstances may require   Signed  J  A  Seddon  Secretary of War  By Command of W  H  Richardson  Adj t Gen l  II  As soon as the command can reach Staunton and transportation can be furnished  the Infantry Battalion and Section of Artillery of the Corps of Cadets will be moved to Richmond  III  Two days cooked rations will be taken  IV  Subsistence stores have been brought from the Institute to accompany the Command  V  The wagons  ambulance and unnecessary servants will be relieved and ordered back to Lexington  VI  Surgeon Madison will remain with the wounded and sick Cadets and see that they are properly cared for  Supplies are left in Staunton to meet their wants  VII  The Superintendent has no words to express his sense of the gallant conduct of the Corps of cadets in the decisive but sanguinary battle of New Market on the 15th inst  The patriotic heart of the Commonwealth and Confederacy responds with proud and grateful emotion at the fortitude  courage and gallant bearing of these brave sons of the South  We have to mourn the loss of the dead   but the names of Cabell  Stanard  Jones  Crockett McDowell  and Jefferson will be honored among the most valued heroes of this eventful struggle  and the scarred bodies of the wounded will be trophies of valor and patriotism of which the Va  Mil  Institute will ever be proud  The Sup t would return this thanks to Lt  Col  Shipp and all the Officers and Cadets for their conduct in this trying service  By Command Maj  Genl  F  H  Smith  signed  J  H  Morrison  A  A  V  M  Inst  Headquarters Va  Military Institute Richmond  May 24  1864 Special Orders No  122  The Corps of Cadets will be reviewed this afternoon on the Capitol Square by His Excellency the President of the Confederate States   in the presence of the Governor of the State and Secretary of War  The Battalion of Infantry and Section of Artillery will be paraded accordingly and marched to the Capitol  subject to the orders of the Governor  By Command Maj  Gen l F  H  Smith   Signed  J  H  Morrison  A  A  V  M  Inst  Order Directing Return to VMI prior to Hunter s Raid  Adjutant General s Office Richmond  June 6  1864  Maj  Gen l  F  H  Smith Supt  Va  Mil  Institute General  The Corps of Cadets having been by order of the President turned over to the State authority and the movements of the enemy appearing to involve the safety of the Institute and other public property at Lexington  the Governor directs that you cause the Corps to be returned to the Institute by Railroad  via Lynchburg  or other route if found more practicable  The Governor approves the order of Ex Governor Letcher of 4th Sept  1863 and adopts it so far as at present applicable  Should the public property at the Institute be found unmolested and practicable to be reached and defended  you will adopt proper measures for that purpose  In the event of difficulty or peril in making that defense except by co operation with the troops of the Confederate Government  it will be needful to afford that co operation  at least to such extent as the security of the Military Institute may require   of which you must of necessity be the judge  Bearing in mind however always  that the Corps be not further exposed in battle than absolute necessity may require  By Command  Wm  H
