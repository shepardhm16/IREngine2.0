The conference will continue tomorrow when the current generation of students takes the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity    Former FBI Director Addresses Conference LEXINGTON  Va  March 5  2012   The entire VMI Corps of Cadets  along with about 500 participants from colleges and high schools around the nation  gathered in Cameron Hall to hear Louis J  Freeh speak on the nature of cheating and dishonesty in America  Freeh served as director of the FBI from 1993 to 2001 and is currently CEO of Freeh Group International  a global consulting enterprise   The issue is cheating  but the issue is obviously much larger than that  said Freeh   It s a seminar about honor and integrity  the values that are core and have been core here since 1839 and which will serve you all and the country very well whether you become military officers or go into our corporate suites  Freeh spoke from his long experience in both the public and private sectors  drawing from his knowledge of crime in America as well as his experience working with corporate America   His private sector experience has given him a unique perspective into corporate ethics  government relations  risk  and global security that is crucial to corporate practice in the 21st century  said Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendent  in introducing Freeh   This experience has also given him a unique insight into what s happening in America  Freeh advocated changing the way Americans think about cheating  from an isolated situation in schools and colleges to a problem pervading all aspects of American society   Part of the disservice that we do in talking about college cheating or high school cheating or SAT cheating in a vacuum is that it doesn t occur in a vacuum  said Freeh   It s part of a much larger problem with our society and a much larger problem with human nature  which is the problem of being honest  the problem of doing the right thing when no one is looking  Freeh used examples of dishonesty in the areas of government  business  journalism  and science to illustrate the fact that the problem is not limited to educational institutions  In offering a solution  Freeh suggested that the problem cannot be solved by simply instituting harsher punitive measures or trying to make cheating impossible  Instead  Freeh advocated focusing on educating in a way that emphasizes mastering course material rather than depending on rote memorization   It s really an inexpensive and practical solution  It s focusing on the learning rather than the test taking    said Freeh  Freeh emphasized the importance of learning and owning knowledge rather than stealing that knowledge through cheating   That knowledge is going to be your key to success and influence and leadership  If it s just 11th hour stolen and transient knowledge  it s not going to have any value to you  said Freeh   Earn it  that s the key to leadership  It s the key to a lot of things in life   John Robertson IV     VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index

Looking Former FBI director Louis Freeh addresses the VMI Corps of Cadets and Leadership Conference registrants    VMI Photo by John Robertson  The 500 seat Gillis Theater on the VMI post was filled to capacity with high school and college students and teachers from across the nation as VMI s second biennial Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  opened today  The conference will continue tomorrow when the current generation of students takes the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity    Former FBI Director Addresses Conference LEXINGTON  Va  March 5  2012   The entire VMI Corps of Cadets  along with about 500 participants from colleges and high schools around the nation  gathered in Cameron Hall to hear Louis J  Freeh speak on the nature of cheating and dishonesty in America  Freeh served as director of the FBI from 1993 to 2001 and is currently CEO of Freeh Group International  a global consulting enterprise   The issue is cheating  but the issue is obviously much larger than that  said Freeh   It s a seminar about honor and integrity  the values that are core and have been core here since 1839 and which will serve you all and the country very well whether you become military officers or go into our corporate suites  Freeh spoke from his long experience in both the public and private sectors  drawing from his knowledge of crime in America as well as his experience working with corporate America   His private sector experience has given him a unique perspective into corporate ethics  government relations  risk  and global security that is crucial to corporate practice in the 21st century  said Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendent  in introducing Freeh   This experience has also given him a unique insight into what s happening in America  Freeh advocated changing the way Americans think about cheating  from an isolated situation in schools and colleges to a problem pervading all aspects of American society   Part of the disservice that we do in talking about college cheating or high school cheating or SAT cheating in a vacuum is that it doesn t occur in a vacuum  said Freeh   It s part of a much larger problem with our society and a much larger problem with human nature  which is the problem of being honest  the problem of doing the right thing when no one is looking  Freeh used examples of dishonesty in the areas of government  business  journalism  and science to illustrate the fact that the problem is not limited to educational institutions  In offering a solution  Freeh suggested that the problem cannot be solved by simply instituting harsher punitive measures or trying to make cheating impossible  Instead  Freeh advocated focusing on educating in a way that emphasizes mastering course material rather than depending on rote memorization   It s really an inexpensive and practical solution  It s focusing on the learning rather than the test taking    said Freeh  Freeh emphasized the importance of learning and owning knowledge rather than stealing that knowledge through cheating   That knowledge is going to be your key to success and influence and leadership  If it s just 11th hour stolen and transient knowledge  it s not going to have any value to you  said Freeh   Earn it  that s the key to leadership  It s the key to a lot of things in life   John Robertson IV     VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos Cindy Bither
