incurring the expense of foreign travel  Lt  Col  Howard Sanborn IV recently set up the first virtual exchange program in the history of the international studies department at VMI  On Oct  24  a group of 15 cadets enrolled in Sanborn s Politics of East Asia course linked up via Skype with a group of students at Shue Yan University in Hong Kong  To accommodate the 12 hour time difference between Lexington and the former British crown colony  the exchange began at 9 p m  for the cadets  which was 9 a m  the next morning for their counterparts in Asia   The greater goal is to get  cadets  thinking about another culture  said Sanborn  associate professor of international studies  He went on to say that while he wishes that each cadet at VMI could study abroad  he s well aware that financial limitations make that impossible for many   The virtual exchange  is a cost effective means of giving students at least the flavor of another culture  noted Sanborn  who is planning to lead cadets on a trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong next summer  Sanborn had long been interested in using technology to create cultural exchange opportunities with students in other countries  but he hadn t made a formal plan for such an exchange until he attended an Asian studies development conference in Houston in March  There  he met Amy Wu  a former journalist now teaching at the University of Maryland  Wu had contacts at Shue Yan University  a private school in Hong Kong  and it was she who suggested that Sanborn make inquiries there  Over the summer  Sanborn traveled to both Hong Kong and Taiwan  and while in Hong Kong  he was able to visit Shue Yan and meet professors there  Because Sanborn s own research focuses on the development of democracy  he chose to make that form of government front and center to the cultural exchange  Working in small groups  cadets took the viewpoint of one of four nations   Japan  China  Taiwan  and the United States   and produced videos about how the nation they re representing views recent student protests in Hong Kong  a city that has been a part of mainland China since 1997  For the past two months  students in Hong Kong have been conducting public demonstrations in favor of electoral reform and thus greater autonomy from Beijing  An election to select a new chief executive for Hong Kong is currently set for 2017   but with a pool of candidates to be pre selected by the central Chinese government  It is that aspect of the system that has fueled the student protests  The goal of the video assignment  explained Sanborn  was for the cadets to understand and be able to explain to others why different governments in Asia would have differing views of the youthful protesters  The Hong Kong students  meanwhile  produced similar videos from the viewpoint of their city s residents  presenting views both in favor of and against the protests  In addition  Sanborn required each cadet to write a brief reflective essay on what democracy means to him or her   When I teach about democracy  part of my goal   is to help my students better appreciate their own democracy  noted Sanborn  who won the 2014 Jackson Hope Prize for Excellence in Published Scholarly Work  In the future  Sanborn would like to teach a class on democracy in East Asia  Said Sanborn   There s no better way to understand your own democracy  which is old  than from studying democracy in a place where it s all new  Two cadets participating in the virtual exchange said they d both learned quite a bit from the experience  not only during the hour and a half long exchange itself  but also from doing the research to produce the videos  Cadet Killian Buckley  15  who was part of a group representing the United States  said that she d found herself and her fellow U S  team members having to walk a fine line in their response to the protests   The U S  doesn t want to take too much of a stance in China s internal politics but the U S  does want to support peaceful protests and democratization throughout the world  she explained  Cadet Mike Piemonte  16  who represented China  could see that while that nation may be the source of the problem  at least in the protesters  minds  it will also ultimately have to be part of the solution   Any gains that the protesters make will be ultimately made through China  he observed  Both Buckley and Piemonte noted that their Hong Kong counterparts had sharply differing views of the protests   You could see how divisive it was  said Buckley  who explained that the Hong Kong students weren t shy about letting their classmates know when they disagreed with them  Both cadets said that the chance to interact with their peers from across the globe more than made up for a Friday night sacrificed   Being able to Skype with another college class in another country was a really interesting experience  said Buckley   This was a once in a lifetime opportunity  Piemonte noted   This is a

Exchange Erases the Miles  In Real Time  Hong Kong Virtual Exchange Erases the Miles As part of an effort to bring cultural exchange to his cadets without incurring the expense of foreign travel  Lt  Col  Howard Sanborn IV recently set up the first virtual exchange program in the history of the international studies department at VMI  On Oct  24  a group of 15 cadets enrolled in Sanborn s Politics of East Asia course linked up via Skype with a group of students at Shue Yan University in Hong Kong  To accommodate the 12 hour time difference between Lexington and the former British crown colony  the exchange began at 9 p m  for the cadets  which was 9 a m  the next morning for their counterparts in Asia   The greater goal is to get  cadets  thinking about another culture  said Sanborn  associate professor of international studies  He went on to say that while he wishes that each cadet at VMI could study abroad  he s well aware that financial limitations make that impossible for many   The virtual exchange  is a cost effective means of giving students at least the flavor of another culture  noted Sanborn  who is planning to lead cadets on a trip to Taiwan and Hong Kong next summer  Sanborn had long been interested in using technology to create cultural exchange opportunities with students in other countries  but he hadn t made a formal plan for such an exchange until he attended an Asian studies development conference in Houston in March  There  he met Amy Wu  a former journalist now teaching at the University of Maryland  Wu had contacts at Shue Yan University  a private school in Hong Kong  and it was she who suggested that Sanborn make inquiries there  Over the summer  Sanborn traveled to both Hong Kong and Taiwan  and while in Hong Kong  he was able to visit Shue Yan and meet professors there  Because Sanborn s own research focuses on the development of democracy  he chose to make that form of government front and center to the cultural exchange  Working in small groups  cadets took the viewpoint of one of four nations   Japan  China  Taiwan  and the United States   and produced videos about how the nation they re representing views recent student protests in Hong Kong  a city that has been a part of mainland China since 1997  For the past two months  students in Hong Kong have been conducting public demonstrations in favor of electoral reform and thus greater autonomy from Beijing  An election to select a new chief executive for Hong Kong is currently set for 2017   but with a pool of candidates to be pre selected by the central Chinese government  It is that aspect of the system that has fueled the student protests  The goal of the video assignment  explained Sanborn  was for the cadets to understand and be able to explain to others why different governments in Asia would have differing views of the youthful protesters  The Hong Kong students  meanwhile  produced similar videos from the viewpoint of their city s residents  presenting views both in favor of and against the protests  In addition  Sanborn required each cadet to write a brief reflective essay on what democracy means to him or her   When I teach about democracy  part of my goal   is to help my students better appreciate their own democracy  noted Sanborn  who won the 2014 Jackson Hope Prize for Excellence in Published Scholarly Work  In the future  Sanborn would like to teach a class on democracy in East Asia  Said Sanborn   There s no better way to understand your own democracy  which is old  than from studying democracy in a place where it s all new  Two cadets participating in the virtual exchange said they d both learned quite a bit from the experience  not only during the hour and a half long exchange itself  but also from doing the research to produce the videos  Cadet Killian Buckley  15  who was part of a group representing the United States  said that she d found herself and her fellow U S  team members having to walk a fine line in their response to the protests   The U S  doesn t want to take too much of a stance in China s internal politics but the U S  does want to support peaceful protests and democratization throughout the world  she explained  Cadet Mike Piemonte  16  who represented China  could see that while that nation may be the source of the problem  at least in the protesters  minds  it will also ultimately have to be part of the solution   Any gains that the protesters make will be ultimately made through China  he observed  Both Buckley and Piemonte noted that their Hong Kong counterparts had sharply differing views of the protests   You could see how divisive it was  said Buckley  who explained that the Hong Kong students weren t shy about letting their classmates know when they disagreed with them  Both cadets said that the chance to interact with their peers from across the globe more than made up for a Friday night sacrificed   Being able to Skype with
