leadership award to Ward Burton   VMI Photo by Kevin Remington    LEXINGTON  Va  April 17  2008   Environment Virginia has named Ward Burton of the Ward Burton Wildlife Foundation the winner of the 2008 Environmental Leadership Award  The Environment Virginia Environmental Leadership Award was established to recognize a Virginian who has made significant individual efforts to better the Commonwealth s environment through vision  expertise  commitment  integrity  communication  diplomacy  and charisma  Ward Burton is a native Virginian from South Boston  and is married to Tabitha Burton  He has three children   Sarah  Jeb  and Ashton  As a NASCAR Cup driver he has multiple career wins  including the prestigious title of 2002 Daytona 500 Winner  Growing up  Ward spent much time in the great outdoors and often lived off the land for days on end at a place called the COVE  which his wildlife foundation owns and manages today  Mr  Burton has always been passionate about the environment  The Ward Burton Wildlife Foundation has many projects and programs that help sustain the environment  The Foundation manages projects such as VaRACER and the Army Compatible Use Program that are making a positive impact in local Virginia communities  The Foundation is holding conservation easements to help preserve the rural culture of Virginia  Foundation programs such as CONNECT and the Wounded Veteran initiative are helping educate children and helping support the wounded heroes that have unselfishly served our country  The Cove is a 2 000  acre wildlife refuge that the Foundation manages  Mr  Burton has embraced the  cooperative conservation  principle of enlisting multiple partners such as local  state  and federal governments  non profits  corporations  and the public to solve environmental problems and making the communities better  As part of winning the award  the Environment Virginia conference would donate  1 000 in Mr  Burton s name to an organization of his choice  Mr  Burton has chosen to not only donate the  1 000 to the Children in Nature program  but match the  1 000 with a donation of his own  while encouraging conference attendees to donate to the program as well  On the award  Mr  Burton states  I certainly appreciate this award  I don t do conservation to be recognized  and the real work is done by the WBWF staff and sponsors  It is the good people with the same passion about preserving natural resources for future generations that make the Foundation projects flourish  The 19th annual Environment Virginia conference  hosted by Virginia Military Institute and the Virginia Military Institute Research Laboratories  along with the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  Virginia Department of Environmental Quality
