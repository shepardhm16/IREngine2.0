Again Biomedical engineer Nicole Hastings speaks at the 2014 STEM conference    VMI Photo by Kevin Remington  Life of a Scientist is One of Metamorphosis  Change  LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  8  2014   Biomedical engineer Nicole Hastings began her presentation to the nearly 300 educators gathered at Virginia Military Institute for the 2014 STEM education conference earlier today by showing a metaphor for her professional life a diagram of a caterpillar on its way to become a butterfly  When she earned a doctorate in biomedical engineering from the University of Virginia  Hastings noted that she thought she d reached the pinnacle she d been striving for  But a scientist s life  she quickly discovered  is one of metamorphosis and change  with no time for stasis   I thought I d become the butterfly  Hastings said   It turned out that I was just beginning the journey  and starting out as the caterpillar all over again   Becoming a scientist is transformational  Now vice president of operations for HemoShear  a human disease biology company  Hastings brought her message   A Metamorphosis from Student to Scientist  to the elementary and middle school educators attending the STEM conference  which this year was entitled   Engineering Ingenuity  Math and Science Concepts in Action  Hastings opened her remarks by talking about what ignites the spark of interest for careers in the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering  and mathematics  Interest often begins when students are quite young  Hastings noted  and the motivating factors differ sharply by gender  According to data compiled by Hastings  four out of five students majoring in the STEM fields in college made the decision to do so in high school or earlier  For 61 percent of men  an interest in computer games was a key driver  whereas for 68 percent of women  a teacher or a class provided the spark  Like the majority of those women surveyed  Hastings explained that her interest in science had begun with a summer four week program in high school   Being in that environment was one thing that made me say   This is something I want to be part of  I m good at this and I can do it  said Hastings   I did have one of those formative experiences  Because of the key role that exposure plays  Hastings noted  HemoShear offers both lab tours and internships for students   These are the types of experiences that will engage students and ignite that spark  and I ve seen that happen personally  said Hastings   It s very exciting  Getting that spark ignited in students is going to be crucial to meeting the nation s future employment needs  Hastings said  She cited statistics showing that job openings for biomedical engineers are expected to increase by 62 percent by 2020  Overall  there s expected to be a 16 8 percent increase in STEM jobs by that year  What s more  Hastings was quick to point out that getting a degree in engineering is a smart move  and not just in terms of employment   Anyone who gets a degree in engineering is setting themselves up well for the rest of their lives  Hastings commented   They become a very deep problem solver  For Hastings  a graduate school research experience just happened to morph into her current role at HemoShear  Dr  Brent Blackman was involved in the development of a new cell based system to better understand vascular disease  and when he made plans to commercialize the product  Hastings likewise planned to join him   This is where my interest in human health and disease became formed  said Hastings  Of her work at HemoShear  Hastings said   It s been an amazing ride  I pinch myself every day  Now doing research for major pharmaceutical companies  HemoShear has grown from four employees in 2009 to 38 today  and has recently moved into new quarters in the old Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville  In addition to the talk by Hastings  and television personality Grant Imahara on Tuesday  STEM conference attendees were offered their choice of multiple workshops led by both VMI faculty and public school personnel  Workshop topics ranged from  Exploring Chaos Through Games  led by Lt  Col  Meagan Herald  associate professor of applied mathematics at VMI  to  Concrete for Kids  led by Maj  Matthew Swenty  assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at VMI  Col  David Gray  director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  said he was pleased by the turnout at this year s conference  with 290 educators from 110 different schools registered one month in advance   So far  the feedback we re getting is very positive  especially having to do with the hands on portion  said Gray  He described the three speakers Hastings  television personality Grant Imahara and educational psychologist Mitchell Nathan as  great catches  who d been able to connect easily with their audiences   From our perspective it s been a very successful conference  Gray commented  Next year s STEM conference  tentatively planned for the fall of 2015  will focus on cyber technology   Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
