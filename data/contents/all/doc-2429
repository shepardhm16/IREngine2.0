summer    Photo courtesy of Tessa Smith  LEXINGTON  Va  Sept  11  2014 A VMI cadet was able to put her Spanish and biology double major to use this summer through an internship in Richmond  Va  where she simultaneously worked at a medical clinic serving low income patients and conducted a Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project  Tessa Smith  15 interned at CrossOver Healthcare Ministry where she acted as a translator and receptionist for Hispanic families  Her internship was coordinated by the Shepherd Higher Education Consortium on Poverty  which is based at Washington and Lee University  Smith was the only VMI cadet selected this summer for one of the prestigious Shepherd internships  While she was working at CrossOver  Smith completed an online course through the California School of Traditional Hispanic Herbalism designed to help her learn about the practices of curanderos  or herbal healers  Smith explained that it s common in Latino culture to visit a curandero  who is likely to recommend herbs or rituals  such as bathing  as a first resource when health complaints arise  whether they are mental or physical in nature  Originally  Smith s SURI project goal had included a survey about Latinos  use of curanderos  which was to be distributed to patients at CrossOver  Red tape and regulations sounded the death knell of the survey  which was never distributed  but Smith was still able to learn quite a bit from the seven week online class   It was a really eye opening experience  said Smith of her studies  She explained that unlike traditional physicians  curanderos often employ a spiritual angle to their practice  Patients  too  sometimes approach illness from a mindset that differs dramatically from that of a physician steeped in biochemistry  Smith experienced this firsthand over the summer  when a woman with epilepsy had a seizure while at the clinic  Witnessing this  her husband began to exclaim that his wife was cursed   This guy was ranting about the evil eye and spirits and such  said Smith  who explained to the man in Spanish that his wife wasn t cursed she had a disease that could be helped with the proper medication  Both Smith s internship and SURI project were designed to help her reach her goal of becoming a physician s assistant  With that goal in mind  Smith would very much like to see physicians become more aware of the cultural issues that can arise when treating Latino patients   My big picture   so what  goal  for the SURI project  was to publish something that physicians can look at and be like   Hey  this is important  and better understand where their patients are coming from  said Smith   A lot of the time doctors are totally dismissive    Understanding the patient s culture  is going to help you better relate to your patients and better treat them  Overseeing Smith s SURI work were Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett  professor of modern languages and cultures  and Col  Wade Bell  professor of biology  Bulger Barnett said that thanks to this internship  Smith would likely be able to  add the cultural piece  that is sometimes lacking when physicians treat patients from other cultures   If she s the one doing a lot of the intake for patients  she ll understand culturally why they do what they do  Bulger Barnett commented  Bell  meanwhile  praised Smith s choice of majors   We ve had several other folks double major or minor in modern languages  and it s a wonderful thing  he noted   A lot of our students do go into healthcare and our increasingly diverse society demands that students understand other cultures  For her part  Smith has had to carry out a lot of independent studies in Spanish because her Spanish courses conflict with her biology labs  It s been a recipe for exhaustion  and lost sleep  as she s always carried at least 18 5 credit hours per semester  and sometimes as many as 20 5   It s definitely been a rough road  but once I graduate with the double major it s definitely going to be worth it  she commented  Smith also reflected positively on her experience with the Shepherd internship   Shepherd is a really excellent program and more VMI cadets should apply for it  she said   It s not easy to get in  but it s very rewarding   Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety
