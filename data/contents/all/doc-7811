founded in 1986 by the VMI Foundation  The group s mission is to learn about investing  To do this  members serve as investment analysts and portfolio managers  Divided into two teams  each team has its own investment style and methodology  Team A focuses on middle sized growth stocks while team B invests only in large capitalization value stocks  CIG is open to all 3rd  2nd and 1st class cadets  without regard to major  Faculty advisors to the CIG are Col  Cliff West and Col  Bob Moreschi  As of December 31  2007  prior to the 2008 market meltdown  the combined assets were just over  243 000  In October the group hit its low point with assets declining some 33  to  160 000  That is the bad news  The good news is that in 2008 the broader market  large capitalization stocks  lost close to 40  while the middle capitalization segment lost over 37  So  the group had a rough 2008 but not as rough as it could have been  Relative to their respective benchmarks  the Standard and Poor s 400 Mid cap for group A and the Standard and Poor s 500 Large cap for group B  both teams have performed well  By the end of 2008  assets had rebounded off the low to  167 000  4 8  After a rocky first quarter in 2009  the group seems to have regained its footing  For the year through April  assets are up about 5 3  while the S P 500 Index is still down for the year by 3 3  and the S P 400 Index is up 4 2  In October 2008  eight members along with the advisors traveled on the sixth annual trip to New York City  The group attended a number of informative meetings hosted by a variety of firms  including Bloomberg  financial data and software provider  Wilkinson O Grady   Co   a private money manager  Goldman Sachs  wealth management group  and TM Capital  investment bank  The NYC alumni again hosted the cadets to dinner  In March 2009  two cadets and Col  Moreschi attended RISE IX  Redefining Investment Strategy Education  at the University of Dayton  Attended by over 2500 domestic and international students and faculty from over 200 colleges and universities  RISE brings leading investment professionals together with the students and faculty in an exciting and interactive learning environment  RISE offers our cadets exposure to Wall Street professional investors and portfolio managers and members of other college and university student investment clubs  Spring 2009
