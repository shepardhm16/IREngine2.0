Virginia Military Institute defines our purpose to train cadets to become  advocates of the American Democracy and free enterprise system  The John W  and Jane M  Roberts American Free Enterprise Program has been an essential component in achieving this mission  Established in the department of economics and business in 1998  the program is made possible by the generosity and support of Mr  and Mrs  John Roberts  founders of the Solite Corporation  It is a demonstrated historical fact that free markets have created higher standards of living for the greatest number of people than any other economic system yet devised  We believe that it is in the national interest that the citizenry be imbued with an understanding of the importance of maintaining and defending the role of free markets in our American way of life  The Roberts Fund has been instrumental in supporting the department and its unique degree program that combines the conceptual framework of an economics degree with the business applications that are common to a degree in business administration  With an economics and business faculty that has a bent toward teaching free market economics and business applications  we are among the few colleges and universities that have the free enterprise system at its central core  One of the main purposes of the Roberts Fund was to support the department in gaining wider recognition for the work we do  Because of the support of Mr  and Mrs  Roberts  the department is now accredited by AACSB   International  the principle accrediting body for business programs in the world  As a wholly undergraduate program  VMI is among a very select group of schools that have achieved this distinction  The John W  and Jane M  Roberts American Free Enterprise Program is made possible because of the unswerving support of Mr  and Mrs  Roberts  founders of the Solite Corporation  Established in the department in 1998  the program supports  2 Institute
