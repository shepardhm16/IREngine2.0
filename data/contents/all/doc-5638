Club Performs in Puerto Rico for Spring Break The VMI Glee Club traveled to Puerto Rico during Spring Break  March 11 20th and performed at eight venues in ten days  The 38 member unit  led by Col  John Brodie and accompanied by Lt  Col   Willy  Funkhouser and Captains Crespo Bosiak  Jackson and Floyd of the US Air Force  The unit travelled to the island on a KC 135 Refueling plane provided by the 434th Airwing from Grissom AFB in Indiana  The Cadets were hosted by Lt  Col  Jose Plaza and the US Army Puerto Rican Fusion Cell whose hospitality and kindliness made the entire ten days a marvelous tour  The Fusion Cell arranged bus and van transportation  billets and food at the Camp Santiago Training Center in Salinas  and all of the performances and tours for the entire week  The cadets were greeted by and gave an  old yell  to Co   Ret  Roberto Gorbea  62 a prominent businessman  and BR of our Superintendent  Gen  JBH Peay III  who generously donated the use of two 15 passenger vans for transportation to and from the base for the entire week  The Club performed at three large Veterans hospitals and a Veterans retirement home  there are over 165 000 Veterans in Puerto Rico  the Ponce Museum of Art  Puerto Rico s premier art museum  and on St  Patrick s Day at the Community Club at Ft  Buchannan in San Juan as guests of Colonel John Cushman  Base Commander   The highlight of the week of performances was a concert on 15 March at a beautiful dome gallery in the Senate building where the Glee Club was presented an official Resolution from the Puerto Rican Senate by Senator Lucy Arce  who recognized and thanked the cadets for their concerts and interaction with the people of Puerto Rico  The cadets then spent the rest of the day exploring El Morro and Old San Juan before returning to Camp Santiago  The cadets were also able to enjoy two days of liberty in Puerto Rico  On Wednesday 16 March the group where were guests of Brig  Gen  Anthony Maldonato USA  Ret  at the Playa Del Mar Resort on the eastern end of the island  and on Saturday 19 March the cadets were able to take a tour and spend the day exploring the El Yunke Rain Forest  As a result of friendships made during the week  the entire club was invited to the home of Fernando and Hernando Perez  private caterers who threw a big cook out for the cadets and staff at their home in Caguas  The most remarkable aspect of the trip was the minimal cost of the trip as billets  air travel and much of the food was provided through the auspices of the Puerto Rican Army Fusion Cell  The cost of taking 43 cadets and staff for ten days was  25 dollars per person day  This could not have been accomplished without the generous support of Lt  Col  Plaza and the Fusion Cell  the 434th Indiana Airwing  and Colonel Gorbea  62  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination
