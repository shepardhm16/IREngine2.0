Khan Academy  offering education  for anyone  anywhere    VMI Photo by Julie Rivera  Khan Academy Founder Discusses His Non profit Online Academy LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  2  2012   Salman Khan believes that access to education should be like access to clean and safe drinking water   a basic need that can be met for all  Khan  founder of the Khan Academy  spoke to an audience of educators at the 2012 VMI STEM education conference Monday night about how the academy came to be and its possibilities for enhancing education in both the developed and developing worlds  He then signed copies of his newly released book  The One World Schoolhouse  Education Reimagined  The Khan Academy is a library of video tutorials and interactive exercises  While most of the academy s offerings focus on mathematics and science  there are now video lectures on subjects ranging from venture capitalism to art history  The site has had 60 million users to date  with up to 7 6 million unique visitors each month  The academy operates as a non profit supported by donations  with usage free to all  During his talk  the Harvard educated Khan expressed a continual sense of wonder that an effort at long distance math tutoring that began less than 10 years ago has now mushroomed into an online empire supported by the likes of Google and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation   I still feel like I m living in a science fiction book  said Khan  who was named to Fortune magazine s  40 under 40  list in 2010  In 2004  Khan was living in Boston and working as a hedge fund analyst when his young cousin Nadia came for a visit and said that she was having trouble in math  Khan immediately started helping her via Yahoo s Doodle notepad  Before long  he had a small audience of 15 appreciative students  all friends and family  In 2006  Khan switched to YouTube as his platform for delivery  and his audience swelled dramatically  Khan ran the academy as a sideline undertaking until 2009  when he quit his day job to explore  and hopefully expand  the possibilities of online learning  Khan explained that in a traditional classroom setting  time is the one constant factor  Schools operate within a set time frame  and in order to cover all of the material  teachers must adhere to a strict pacing guide  That works fine for students who have mastered the concepts presented within the set time frame   but what about the others  All too often  Khan believes  they are forced to move on to the next concept before they are ready  and in a sequential subject such as mathematics  this results in students who are frustrated and ready to give up  The Khan Academy eliminates this problem by allowing students to work at their own pace  Khan shared the success story of schools in Los Altos  Calif  which are now using the academy s mathematics tutorials for all students in grades five through eight   What  teachers  really saw was the attitudinal change of the students  said Khan   They learn to learn  In the developing world  the Khan Academy is opening doors that otherwise would have remained firmly shut  The academy s mission statement is   A world class education for anyone  anywhere  and with that mission in mind  Khan has put a special emphasis on reaching the educationally underserved  He s particularly proud of a 16 year old girl living in a Mongolian orphanage  who has translated 100 Khan Academy videos for her fellow residents  Technology  Khan believes  can break down the barriers which have traditionally separated the haves and have nots   It makes me very

offering education  for anyone  anywhere    VMI Photo by Julie Rivera  Khan Academy Founder Discusses His Non profit Online Academy LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  2  2012   Salman Khan believes that access to education should be like access to clean and safe drinking water   a basic need that can be met for all  Khan  founder of the Khan Academy  spoke to an audience of educators at the 2012 VMI STEM education conference Monday night about how the academy came to be and its possibilities for enhancing education in both the developed and developing worlds  He then signed copies of his newly released book  The One World Schoolhouse  Education Reimagined  The Khan Academy is a library of video tutorials and interactive exercises  While most of the academy s offerings focus on mathematics and science  there are now video lectures on subjects ranging from venture capitalism to art history  The site has had 60 million users to date  with up to 7 6 million unique visitors each month  The academy operates as a non profit supported by donations  with usage free to all  During his talk  the Harvard educated Khan expressed a continual sense of wonder that an effort at long distance math tutoring that began less than 10 years ago has now mushroomed into an online empire supported by the likes of Google and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation   I still feel like I m living in a science fiction book  said Khan  who was named to Fortune magazine s  40 under 40  list in 2010  In 2004  Khan was living in Boston and working as a hedge fund analyst when his young cousin Nadia came for a visit and said that she was having trouble in math  Khan immediately started helping her via Yahoo s Doodle notepad  Before long  he had a small audience of 15 appreciative students  all friends and family  In 2006  Khan switched to YouTube as his platform for delivery  and his audience swelled dramatically  Khan ran the academy as a sideline undertaking until 2009  when he quit his day job to explore  and hopefully expand  the possibilities of online learning  Khan explained that in a traditional classroom setting  time is the one constant factor  Schools operate within a set time frame  and in order to cover all of the material  teachers must adhere to a strict pacing guide  That works fine for students who have mastered the concepts presented within the set time frame   but what about the others  All too often  Khan believes  they are forced to move on to the next concept before they are ready  and in a sequential subject such as mathematics  this results in students who are frustrated and ready to give up  The Khan Academy eliminates this problem by allowing students to work at their own pace  Khan shared the success story of schools in Los Altos  Calif  which are now using the academy s mathematics tutorials for all students in grades five through eight   What  teachers  really saw was the attitudinal change of the students  said Khan   They learn to learn  In the developing world  the Khan Academy is opening doors that otherwise would have remained firmly shut  The academy s mission statement is   A world class education for anyone  anywhere  and with that mission in mind  Khan has put a special emphasis on reaching the educationally underserved  He s particularly proud of a 16 year old girl living in a Mongolian orphanage  who has translated 100 Khan Academy videos for her fellow residents  Technology  Khan believes  can break down the barriers which have traditionally separated the haves and have nots   It makes me very hopeful for the world  he
