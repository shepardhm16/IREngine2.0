classroom confrontation between Major Jackson and Cadet James A  Walker  later Brigadier General  CSA  led to the expulsion of Walker and subsequently to Walker issuing Jackson a challenge to a duel  At issue was Walker s behavior while solving a problem in Jackson s Natural Philosophy class  VMI convened a court martial  at which Cadet Walker stood accused of disobeying an order and conduct disrespectful to his superior officer  The Trial Excerpt from Major Jackson s testimony Major T  J  Jackson  a witness on the part of the prosecution was called  duly sworn   deposed as follows  On or about the 4 May 1852 while the accused was attending recitation in the Department of Nat  Phil  at the Virginia Military Institute  I sent him to the board to find the hour angle of the sun  His result was not obtained in a manner satisfactory to me  I sent him to his seat  he asked me in what his error consisted  I considered his manner disrespectful  I sent Mr  Blankenship to the board and gave him the explanation of finding the time of day  Having examined the new edition I saw that I could not reasonably expect from the accused the demonstration given in the old edition which I had studied  Some time after I saw my error I sent the accused to the board   gave him the same proposition as before and during his recitation gave him the explanation for finding the time of day  He appeared to object to the investigation   wished to know whether such explanation was reqd  of him  I told him he was not expected to understand the subject but that it was my duty to explain it to him  I said this in what I considered a conciliatory tone  I considered his conduct disrespectful  Previously to the section s leaving the recitation room he said to me that my conduct must change or his must  I believe he asked permission to speak before this  He wished to continue talking  but I did not wish him to do so   told him so  I told him that all I required of him was that he should behave himself  The next day he returned to the Section room in the Department of Nat  Philosophy  Mr  Whitney  a member of his section  asked me to give an explanation of the method of finding the time of day  I did so  and then sent several members to the board and called on Mr  Blankenship to give that method  Subsequently I called on Mr  Walker to do the same  He stated that he did not know how to do it   being informed by me that I had explained the method to him the previous day  he said that I had attempted to do so  I told him that I did explain it but that he might not have understood it  I said this in what I considered a conciliating tone  He again stated that I had attempted to explain it  and that I did not ask him whether he understood it or not  I considered his manner improper  I considered it insolent  I called his attention to his manner being improper   as he continued to talk  I ordered him to stop he disobeyed the order saying he would stop talking if I would stop  or words to that effect  I again ordered him to stop  saying Silence  Mr  Walker  or words to that effect  in an imperative   authoritative tone  He again disobeyed the order   said he would stop talking if I would stop  or words to that effect  After I had given the last order I sent him to his seat  I subsequently reminded him of his assertion of the previous day that his conduct must change or that mine must  I told him that mine would not change  In reply I understood him to say that he had said that he did not intend to change his  After some reflection I ordered him to his quarters under arrest  Excerpt from Cadet Walker s testimony Major Jackson is a stranger amongst us   brings from the field of his late brilliant achievements many singular and eccentric notions  With a rigidity of adherence to the letter of his instructions known only to the veteran  he unites a mind suspicious by nature  a temper made irritable by sickness and suffering  and a tone imperative by long habit of commanding  He is one too who is very likely to misconstrue the motive and conduct of those with whom he has to deal It has been these peculiarities of his nature combined with his acknowledged rule of conforming his treatment to the conduct of the cadet which has led to the present unhappy misunderstanding with myself  First he entirely misconstrued my conduct  then all my expressions of the most polite deference instead of convincing him of his error only served as new fuel to the flame  Next he conformed his manner to his misconstruction of mine   his language becomes

 While under confinement  Walker asked another cadet to deliver a note to Jackson demanding a duel  Of course  no duel took place  Jackson maintained his usual routine and Walker was sent home  Superintendent Francis H  Smith wrote the following to Walker s father on May 17   It is my unpleasant duty to inform you that in consequence of the insubordinate conduct of your son to the Professor of Natural Philosophy  it was necessary to bring his case before a Court Martial  and the result of their action has been his dismissal This morning he called at my office and in terms in the highest

 told him so  I told him that all I required of him was that he should behave himself  The next day he returned to the Section room in the Department of Nat  Philosophy  Mr  Whitney  a member of his section  asked me to give an explanation of the method of finding the time of day  I did so  and then sent several members to the board and called on Mr  Blankenship to give that method  Subsequently

angle of the sun  His result was not obtained in a manner satisfactory to me  I sent him to his seat  he asked me in what his error consisted  I considered his manner disrespectful  I sent Mr  Blankenship to the board and gave him the explanation of finding the time of day  Having examined the new edition I saw that I could not reasonably expect from the accused the demonstration given in the old edition which I had studied  Some time after I saw my error I sent the accused to the board   gave him the same proposition as before and during his recitation gave him the explanation for finding the time of day  He appeared to object to the investigation   wished to know whether such explanation was reqd  of him  I told him he was not expected to understand the subject but that it was my duty to explain it to him  I said this in what I considered a conciliatory tone  I considered his conduct disrespectful  Previously to the section s leaving the recitation room he said to me that my conduct must change or his must  I believe he asked permission to speak before this  He wished to continue talking  but I did not wish him to do so   told him so  I told him that all I required of him was that he should behave himself The next day he returned to the Section room in the Department of Nat  Philosophy  Mr  Whitney  a member of his section  asked me to give an explanation of the method of finding the time of day  I did so  and then sent several members to the board and called on Mr  Blankenship to give that method  Subsequently I called on Mr  Walker to do the same  He stated that he did not know how to do it   being informed by me that I had explained the method to him the previous day  he said that I had attempted to do so  I told him that I did explain it but that he might not have understood it  I said this in what I considered a conciliating tone  He again stated that I had attempted to explain it  and that I did not ask him whether he understood it or not  I considered his manner improper  I considered it insolent  I called his attention to his manner being improper   as he continued to talk  I ordered him to stop he disobeyed the order saying he would stop talking if I would stop  or words to that effect  I again ordered him to stop  saying Silence  Mr  Walker  or words to that effect  in an imperative   authoritative tone  He again disobeyed the order   said he would stop talking if I would stop  or words to that effect  After I had given the last order I sent him to his seat  I subsequently reminded him of his assertion of the previous day that his conduct must change or that mine must  I told him that mine would not change  In reply I understood him to say that he had said that he did not intend to change his  After some reflection I ordered him to his quarters under arrest Silence  Mr  Walker Excerpt from Cadet Walker s testimony Major Jackson is a stranger amongst us   brings from the field of his late brilliant achievements many singular and eccentric notions  With a rigidity of adherence to the letter of his instructions known only to the veteran  he unites a mind suspicious by nature  a temper made irritable by sickness and suffering  and a tone imperative by long habit of commanding  He is one too who is very likely to misconstrue the motive and conduct of those with whom he has to deal It has been these peculiarities of his nature combined with his acknowledged rule of conforming his treatment to the conduct of the cadet which has led to the present unhappy misunderstanding with myself  First he entirely misconstrued my conduct  then all my expressions of the most polite deference instead of convincing him of his error only served as new fuel to the flame  Next he conformed his manner to his misconstruction of mine   his language becomes angry  imperative   harsh if not insulting First he entirely misconstrued my conduct  then all my expressions of the most polite deference instead of convincing him of his error only served as new fuel to the flame  Next he conformed his manner to his misconstruction of mine   his language becomes angry  imperative   harsh if not insulting The Outcome Walker  a first classman just a few weeks short of graduation  was found guilty of disrespect  He was dismissed  and refused his right to appeal  While under confinement  Walker asked another cadet to deliver a note to Jackson demanding a duel  Of course  no duel took place  Jackson maintained his usual routine and Walker was sent home  Superintendent Francis H  Smith wrote the following to Walker s father on May 17   It is my unpleasant duty to inform you that in consequence of the insubordinate conduct of your son to the Professor of Natural Philosophy  it was necessary to bring his case before a Court Martial  and the result of their action has been his dismissal This morning he called at my office and in terms in the highest degree disrespectful and insulting to the Supt  declined to take any appeal I would advise you to come up at once and take him home as I have reason to believe he may involve himself in serious difficulty  After the Civil War  General Walker was granted an honorary degree by the VMI Board of Visitors The Outcome      VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni VMI Foundation VMI Foundation
