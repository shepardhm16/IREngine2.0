engineering or mathematics  Each conference seeks to bring educators and students across Virginia together for two days of professional development  enrichment and fun  STEM 2014 This third VMI STEM Education Conference explored engineering principles and pedagogical methods and strategies with the goal of incorporating engineering concepts and projects into the teaching of math and science  It was specifically designed for classroom  math and science teachers of grades three through eight  as well as the administrators who support them  All participants had the opportunity to participate in workshops and sessions with VMI faculty and teachers from across the commonwealth  as well as take part in small group discussions on best practices and sign up to deliver five minute  open mic  speed

well in the classroom  and the broader learning environment including engineering programs that engage students beyond the classroom  The schedule included a keynote address delivered by Mr  Grant Imahara of Mythbusters whose insights on the  ingredients  needed to make STEM learning fun were in turn highly entertaining for our audience   We also listened to great speakers like Dr  Nathan whose research in STEM learning was well received  Dr  Hastings who spoke on her educational and career choices in STEM and related those experiences back to the role of STEM educators and finally  Dr  Steven Staples  our current Superintendent of Instruction who spoke to us about the State s emphasis desire to improve STEM education  the need to be leaders in this field  teacher and student

Marshall Hall 500 Anderson Drive Lexington  VA  24450 About the Conference  The VMI STEM Education Conference series is in its 4th year  Each year has had a particular focus on science  technology  engineering or mathematics  Each conference seeks to bring educators and students across Virginia together for two days of professional development  enrichment and fun  STEM 2014 This third VMI STEM Education Conference explored engineering principles and pedagogical methods and strategies with the goal of incorporating engineering concepts and projects into the teaching of math and science  It was specifically designed for classroom  math and science teachers of grades three through eight  as well as the administrators who support them  All participants had the opportunity to participate in workshops and sessions with VMI faculty and teachers from across the commonwealth  as well as take part in small group discussions on best practices and sign up to deliver five minute  open mic  speed presentations  Through this diverse  dynamic schedule  attendees gained a better understanding of engineering  including research and careers for current and next generations  lesson plans that work well in the classroom  and the broader learning environment including engineering programs that engage students beyond the classroom  The schedule included a keynote address delivered by Mr  Grant Imahara of Mythbusters whose insights on the  ingredients  needed to make STEM learning fun were in turn highly entertaining for our audience   We also listened to great speakers like Dr  Nathan whose research in STEM learning was well received  Dr  Hastings who spoke on her educational and career choices in STEM and related those experiences back to the role of STEM educators and finally  Dr  Steven Staples  our current Superintendent of Instruction who spoke to us about the State s emphasis desire to improve STEM education  the need to be leaders in this field  teacher and student credentialing so that we get the right teachers into our classroom and we are giving our students meaningful credentials so they have more choices upon graduation    2014 STEM Conference Program
