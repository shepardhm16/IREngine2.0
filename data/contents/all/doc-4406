establish endowments that will remain in perpetuity while generating income to support athletic scholarships  However  our endowment fundraising must come in addition to raising the annual money to meet the growing demand it takes to finance VMI s Division I athletic program  We need to build our donor base and encourage everyone to continue doing all that they can  With proper funding  we can win at VMI  Thanks to all of those who believe in and love VMI and what it stands for today  Cavallaro concluded  To become a member of the Keydet Club you may Click Here  or call the Keydet Club at 1
