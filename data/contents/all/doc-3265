24450 Institute Report  April 2008 By Wendy Lovell Depending on his location  a visitor to Post on April 3 could have mistaken the Virginia Military Institute for the Department of Homeland Security  a medical laboratory  an engineering firm  or the floor of Congress  From national security issues to West Nile virus and HVAC systems to the war in Iraq  topics of discussion during the sixth annual VMI Undergraduate Research Symposium were both stimulating and reflective of top of mind issues faced by U S  policy makers  scientists  business leaders and philosophers today  Funded by a grant from the Jackson Hope Fund  URS is one of the primary programs developed by the Undergraduate Research Initiative to encourage cadets to learn by conducting scholarly inquiry under the guidance of a faculty mentor  The day long event featured 120 presentations in the form of posters and papers   With record participation  such strong representation across the disciplines and the integration of exciting highlights from ongoing classroom research activities  this year s URS is a sparkling testimony of the Institute s full embrace of undergraduate research  said Brig  Gen  Charles F  Brower IV  deputy superintendent for academics and dean of the faculty   Cadets working with faculty in open ended academic inquiry has indeed become a hallmark of a VMI education  Directed by Lt  Col  Jay Sullivan  associate professor of mechanical engineering  URS included a few additions to this year s program  Seven members of the Lexington Sunrise Rotary Club with professional backgrounds served as URS judges  and presentations of mechanical engineering students  senior design projects were added to the program   I received a lot of positive feedback from our external judges regarding the quality of our cadets  research and their presentations  said Sullivan   They enjoyed being part of URS  as did some of the underclassmen who viewed some of the presentations as part of their regular classes  They likely would not have attended the presentations on their own but were excited by the possibilities of what they will do later in their cadetships  Cash prizes of  500 were awarded to first place winners   300 to second  and  100 to third  The following cadets were honored for their research at the culmination of URS  In the liberal arts oral presentation category  cadets Amanda
