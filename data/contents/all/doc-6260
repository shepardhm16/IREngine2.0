Dr  Dan Ariely discusses dishonesty in Gillis Theater during the 2014 VMI Honor Summit    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  LEXINGTON  Va  Feb  24  2014   Everybody lies  sometimes  Everybody cheats  sometimes  There are ways  though  to manipulate the environment so that these evasions of the truth will happen with less frequency  This theory of what might be called  truth management  was the topic of behavioral economist Dr  Dan Ariely s keynote speech at the 2014 VMI Honor Summit  an event meant to follow up on last year s honor conference at VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  The honor summit drew approximately 80 participants  including 21 faculty and staff  from predominantly East Coast colleges and universities  all with honor codes  Two participants flew in from Texas A M University  while other groups came from as far south as The Citadel  in Charleston  S C  and as far north as the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point  N Y  Ariely  who is the James B  Duke professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University  is the author of three best selling books that attempt to use economic theories to explain why individuals make the decisions they do  His most recent book is  The Honest Truth About Dishonesty  How We Lie to Everyone   Especially Ourselves  At VMI  Ariely chose as the title of his remarks   Dishonesty  How Good People Can Misbehave and Still Think of Themselves as Good  Kicking off what would become an hour of back and forth dialogue with his audience  Ariely began by asking the members of the audience in Gillis Theater to raise their hands if they d lied in the past year  Almost everyone in the auditorium raised his or her hand  including the speaker himself   We often change the truth   for all sorts of reasons  Ariely noted  This is particularly true for students  he remarked  because their social and professional realms have almost a 100 percent overlap  There  he said  one of the main goals of the social realm   being liked   is often in direct conflict with one of the main goals of the professional learning realm  ensuring fair behavior by all  Ariely noted that the kind of trust an honor code strives to build isn t just a feel good emotion   Honesty is a social good  he explained   If we stop trusting each other  society deteriorates pretty rapidly  With that precept established  Ariely then gave several examples in which people were able to cheat and get away with it  and did so with abandon  In one of those instances  people were told they d be paid  1 for each math problem they solved correctly  The catch was that the number of problems solved correctly had to be self reported   and in the overwhelming majority of instances  people said they d solved just a few more problems correctly than they actually did  They were therefore able to increase their payback  Ariely noted that this experiment has been done with over 40 000 people so far  Of that number  over 28 000 have cheated at least a little bit   and as a group  they ve netted a collective total of about  60 000 for their dishonesty  The cheating gets even worse  he continued  when people see someone else cheat  In the case of the math problem experiment  the researchers changed the parameters of the experiment by giving their subjects an envelope of money up front  and telling them they could keep the entire amount of money in the envelope if they solved all of the problems correctly within the allotted time  They then hired an acting student to stand up and announce   I m done  Can I go now  well before anyone else had finished  When fellow participants saw the acting student leave with a full envelope of money  the numbers of people cheating rose sharply  This was particularly true  he said  when the acting student wore a shirt with the name of the school at which the experiment was being conducted  If the acting student wore a shirt with the name of a rival school   and thus branded himself or herself as a social outsider   the amount of cheating dropped drastically   Dishonesty is  not about being caught  said Ariely   It s about being socially acceptable  In another  similar experiment  people were told to put coins in a vending machine and get candy  Unbeknownst to the participants  the machine had been rigged to give them their money back  and the candy  The researchers had placed a large sign on the machine urging anyone who witnessed the machine malfunctioning to call a telephone number that was prominently displayed  Ariely said that no one called that number  although several people did call their friends to tell them about the free candy  In this case  Ariely said  the individuals who cheated the vending machine company justified their behavior by saying they were  balancing Karma  paying themselves back for all of the past instances in which vending machines had taken their money and given them nothing at all in return  Thanks to the math problem and vending machine experiments  and others  Ariely and his fellow researchers have learned that people can cheat and still feel good about themselves  It s that balance of wanting benefit for one s self versus wanting to feel good about one s self  which drives such behavior  the behavioral economist explained  Ariely has found that one effective way to discourage dishonesty is to prompt people to think of their own moral codes before they are placed in a situation in which they might be tempted to cheat  In one experiment at Univeristy of California Los Angeles  500 students were asked to recall the 10 commandments and write them down  Not a single student could recall all of the commandments  but not a single one cheated in the experiment which came afterward  Subsequently  Ariely conducted experiments at MIT  which does not have an honor code  and at Princeton University  which has a stringent honor code  complete with a week long training for freshmen  He found the same results that he had at UCLA  students who were reminded of their own moral codes did not cheat   A week long crash course in morality  as is the case at Princeton  doesn t seem to have any effect two weeks down the road  said Ariely   What does help is getting people to think about their own morality just before they are tempted to misbehave  Near the end of his remarks  Ariely gave two examples of behaviors  one relatively uncommon  and the other extremely common  Ariely asked his audience to consider why people typically don t leave restaurants without paying for their meals  when this is relatively easy to do  He then explained that nearly everyone would feel too guilty to do this  Many of those same people  though  have illegally downloaded software or music on their computers  and they don t feel guilty at all   It s really about caring  said Ariely   How do we get people to care  Preliminary plans call for the honor conference to be held in odd numbered years  while the Honor Summit will be held in even numbered years  said Capt  Beth Stefanik  communications specialist at the Center for Leadership and Ethics   The Honor Summit  is a way to continue the discussions between honor

Dishonesty Inspires Lively Discussion Dr  Dan Ariely discusses dishonesty in Gillis Theater during the 2014 VMI Honor Summit    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  LEXINGTON  Va  Feb  24  2014   Everybody lies  sometimes  Everybody cheats  sometimes  There are ways  though  to manipulate the environment so that these evasions of the truth will happen with less frequency  This theory of what might be called  truth management  was the topic of behavioral economist Dr  Dan Ariely s keynote speech at the 2014 VMI Honor Summit  an event meant to follow up on last year s honor conference at VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  The honor summit drew approximately 80 participants  including 21 faculty and staff  from predominantly East Coast colleges and universities  all with honor codes  Two participants flew in from Texas A M University  while other groups came from as far south as The Citadel  in Charleston  S C  and as far north as the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point  N Y  Ariely  who is the James B  Duke professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University  is the author of three best selling books that attempt to use economic theories to explain why individuals make the decisions they do  His most recent book is  The Honest Truth About Dishonesty  How We Lie to Everyone   Especially Ourselves  At VMI  Ariely chose as the title of his remarks   Dishonesty  How Good People Can Misbehave and Still Think of Themselves as Good  Kicking off what would become an hour of back and forth dialogue with his audience  Ariely began by asking the members of the audience in Gillis Theater to raise their hands if they d lied in the past year  Almost everyone in the auditorium raised his or her hand  including the speaker himself   We often change the truth   for all sorts of reasons  Ariely noted  This is particularly true for students  he remarked  because their social and professional realms have almost a 100 percent overlap  There  he said  one of the main goals of the social realm   being liked   is often in direct conflict with one of the main goals of the professional learning realm  ensuring fair behavior by all  Ariely noted that the kind of trust an honor code strives to build isn t just a feel good emotion   Honesty is a social good  he explained   If we stop trusting each other  society deteriorates pretty rapidly  With that precept established  Ariely then gave several examples in which people were able to cheat and get away with it  and did so with abandon  In one of those instances  people were told they d be paid  1 for each math problem they solved correctly  The catch was that the number of problems solved correctly had to be self reported   and in the overwhelming majority of instances  people said they d solved just a few more problems correctly than they actually did  They were therefore able to increase their payback  Ariely noted that this experiment has been done with over 40 000 people so far  Of that number  over 28 000 have cheated at least a little bit   and as a group  they ve netted a collective total of about  60 000 for their dishonesty  The cheating gets even worse  he continued  when people see someone else cheat  In the case of the math problem experiment  the researchers changed the parameters of the experiment by giving their subjects an envelope of money up front  and telling them they could keep the entire amount of money in the envelope if they solved all of the problems correctly within the allotted time  They then hired an acting student to stand up and announce   I m done  Can I go now  well before anyone else had finished  When fellow participants saw the acting student leave with a full envelope of money  the numbers of people cheating rose sharply  This was particularly true  he said  when the acting student wore a shirt with the name of the school at which the experiment was being conducted  If the acting student wore a shirt with the name of a rival school   and thus branded himself or herself as a social outsider   the amount of cheating dropped drastically   Dishonesty is  not about being caught  said Ariely   It s about being socially acceptable  In another  similar experiment  people were told to put coins in a vending machine and get candy  Unbeknownst to the participants  the machine had been rigged to give them their money back  and the candy  The researchers had placed a large sign on the machine urging anyone who witnessed the machine malfunctioning to call a telephone number that was prominently displayed  Ariely said that no one called that number  although several people did call their friends to tell them about the free candy  In this case  Ariely said  the individuals who cheated the vending machine company justified their behavior by saying they were  balancing Karma  paying themselves back for all of the past instances in which vending machines had taken their money and given them nothing at all in return  Thanks to the math problem and vending machine experiments  and others  Ariely and his fellow researchers have learned that people can cheat and still feel good about themselves  It s that balance of wanting benefit for one s self versus wanting to feel good about one s self  which drives such behavior  the behavioral economist explained  Ariely has found that one effective way to discourage dishonesty is to prompt people to think of their own moral codes before they are placed in a situation in which they might be tempted to cheat  In one experiment at Univeristy of California Los Angeles  500 students were asked to recall the 10 commandments and write them down  Not a single student could recall all of the commandments  but not a single one cheated in the experiment which came afterward  Subsequently  Ariely conducted experiments at MIT  which does not have an honor code  and at Princeton University  which has a stringent honor code  complete with a week long training for freshmen  He found the same results that he had at UCLA  students who were reminded of their own moral codes did not cheat   A week long crash course in morality  as is the case at Princeton  doesn t seem to have any effect two weeks down the road  said Ariely   What does help is getting people to think about their own morality just before they are tempted to misbehave  Near the end of his remarks  Ariely gave two examples of behaviors  one relatively uncommon  and the other extremely common  Ariely asked his audience to consider why people typically don t leave restaurants without paying for their meals  when this is relatively easy to do  He then explained that nearly everyone would feel too guilty to do this  Many of those same people  though  have illegally downloaded software or music on their computers  and they don t feel guilty at all   It s really about caring  said Ariely   How do we get people to care  Preliminary plans call for the honor conference to be held in odd numbered years  while the Honor Summit will be held in even numbered years  said Capt  Beth Stefanik  communications specialist at the Center for Leadership and Ethics   The Honor Summit

deteriorates pretty rapidly  With that precept established  Ariely then gave several examples in which people were able to cheat and get away with it  and did so with abandon  In one of those instances  people were told they d be paid  1 for each math problem they solved correctly  The catch was that the number of problems solved correctly had to be self reported   and in the overwhelming majority of instances  people said they d solved just a few more problems correctly than they actually did  They were therefore able to increase their payback  Ariely noted that this experiment has been done with over 40 000 people so far  Of that number  over 28 000 have cheated at least a little bit   and as a group  they ve netted a collective total of about  60 000 for their dishonesty  The cheating gets even worse  he continued  when people see someone else cheat  In the case of the math problem experiment  the researchers changed the parameters of the experiment by giving their subjects an envelope of money up front  and telling them they could keep the entire amount of money in the envelope if they solved all of the problems correctly within the allotted time  They then hired an acting student to stand up and announce   I m done  Can I go now  well before anyone else had finished  When fellow participants saw the acting student leave with a full envelope of money  the numbers of people cheating rose sharply  This was particularly true  he said  when the acting student wore a shirt with the name of the school at which the experiment was being conducted  If the acting student wore a shirt with the name of a rival school   and thus branded himself or herself as a social outsider   the amount of cheating dropped drastically   Dishonesty is  not about being caught  said Ariely   It s about being socially acceptable  In another  similar experiment  people were told to put coins in a vending machine and get candy  Unbeknownst to the participants  the machine had been rigged to give them their money back  and the candy  The researchers had placed a large sign on the machine urging anyone who witnessed the machine malfunctioning to call a telephone number that was prominently displayed  Ariely said that no one called that number  although several people did call their friends to tell them about the free candy  In this case  Ariely said  the individuals who cheated the vending machine company justified their behavior by saying they were  balancing Karma  paying themselves back for all of the past instances in which vending machines had taken their money and given them nothing at all in return  Thanks to the math problem and vending machine experiments  and others  Ariely and his fellow researchers have learned that people can cheat and still feel good about themselves  It s that balance of wanting benefit for one s self versus wanting to feel good about one s self  which drives such behavior  the behavioral economist explained  Ariely has found that one effective way to discourage dishonesty is to prompt people to think of their own moral codes before they are placed in a situation in which they might be tempted to cheat  In one experiment at Univeristy of California Los Angeles  500 students were asked to recall the 10 commandments and write them down  Not a single student could recall all of the commandments  but not a single one cheated in the experiment which came afterward  Subsequently  Ariely conducted experiments at MIT  which does not have an honor code  and at Princeton University  which has a stringent honor code  complete with a week long training for freshmen  He found the same results that he had at UCLA  students who were reminded of their own moral codes did not cheat   A week long crash course in morality  as is the case at Princeton  doesn t seem to have any effect two weeks down the road  said Ariely   What does help is getting people to think about their own morality just before they are tempted to misbehave  Near the end of his remarks  Ariely gave two examples of behaviors  one relatively uncommon  and the other extremely common  Ariely asked his audience to consider why people typically don t leave restaurants without paying for their meals  when this is relatively easy to do  He then explained that nearly everyone would feel too guilty to do this  Many of those same people  though  have illegally downloaded software or music on their computers  and they don t feel guilty at all   It s really about caring  said Ariely   How do we get people to care  Preliminary plans call for the honor conference to be held in odd numbered years  while the Honor Summit will be held in even numbered years  said Capt  Beth Stefanik  communications specialist at the Center for

the 2014 VMI Honor Summit    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin LEXINGTON  Va  Feb  24  2014   Everybody lies  sometimes  Everybody cheats  sometimes  There are ways  though  to manipulate the environment so that these evasions of the truth will happen with less frequency  This theory of what might be called  truth management  was the topic of behavioral economist Dr  Dan Ariely s keynote speech at the 2014 VMI Honor Summit  an event meant to follow up on last year s honor conference at VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  The honor summit drew approximately 80 participants  including 21 faculty and staff  from predominantly East Coast colleges and universities  all with honor codes  Two participants flew in from Texas A M University  while other groups came from as far south as The Citadel  in Charleston  S C  and as far north as the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point  N Y  Ariely  who is the James B  Duke professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University  is the author of three best selling books that attempt to use economic theories to explain why individuals make the decisions they do  His most recent book is  The Honest Truth About Dishonesty  How We Lie to Everyone   Especially Ourselves  At VMI  Ariely chose as the title of his remarks   Dishonesty  How Good People Can Misbehave and Still Think of Themselves as Good  Kicking off what would become an hour of back and forth dialogue with his audience  Ariely began by asking the members of the audience in Gillis Theater to raise their hands if they d lied in the past year  Almost everyone in the auditorium raised his or her hand  including the speaker himself   We often change the truth   for all sorts of reasons  Ariely noted  This is particularly true for students  he remarked  because their social and professional realms have almost a 100 percent overlap  There  he said  one of the main goals of the social realm   being liked   is often in direct conflict with one of the main goals of the professional learning realm  ensuring fair behavior by all  Ariely noted that the kind of trust an honor code strives to build isn t just a feel good emotion   Honesty is a
