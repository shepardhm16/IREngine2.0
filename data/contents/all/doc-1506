descriptions the figures on the title lines indicate  in order  the class hours per week  the laboratory or field work hours per week  and the semester hours credit  For example  the figures  3 2 4  mean that the class meets three times a week for one hour classroom sessions and has two hours of laboratory  supervised research  or field work each week  and that the course carries four semester hours of credit Course Numbering System  Each subject is identified by a symbol made up of two parts  The first part is an abbreviation denoting the general field of study  The second part is a number denoting the particular subject  The first digit indicates the year in which the course is usually taken and  therefore  the level of instruction  Credit  The unit of academic credit used at the
