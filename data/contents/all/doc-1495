Preston Library Parents Council VMI Parents Council The VMI Parents Council was formed in 1957 to provide information and assistance to the parents of cadets attending VMI  Members of the Parents Council are selected from parents of cadets in the upper three classes  The purposes of the Parents Council are to develop closer ties between parents and VMI  to help parents serve as ambassadors for VMI  and to assist the Institute in providing for the welfare and development of cadets  The Council is to be a sounding board to help cadets and their families gain the most from VMI  If the Council can help a parent understand VMI and provide a ready source of information to all cadets and parents  then it has met its challenge  The Parents Council meets formally twice a year at VMI  The fall meeting is held on Parents Weekend  Council representatives regularly attend VMI events to answer questions and act as hosts and hostesses  VMI Research Laboratories The VMI Research Laboratories was established in 1963 as a private non profit Virginia Corporation to encourage and promote faculty research  It fosters educational objectives by supporting scientific investigation and contractual research  Since cadets assist faculty members  activities of the Research Laboratories help to teach research techniques  Policies of the Corporation are established and carried out by a 15 man Board of Directors  The Chairman of the Board is Colonel Victor J  Bernet  M D  of Olney  Maryland and the Director of Research is Dr  Richard A  Rowe  Professor of Biology  During 2007 2008 twelve faculty members and several cadets were employed part time on contracts totaling in excess of  2 610 197 and dealing with areas including chemoresponses  modeling of glass forming processes  wastewater treatment  thin films  glass chemistry  nuclear waste immobilization and analysis of leadership traits  During 2007 2008  grants from FMC Corporation  Research Corporation  VDOT  Jeffress Trust  Emhart Glass Research and various industry sources were awarded to VMI faculty and administered by the VMIRL  Sponsored events include the annual Environment Virginia Symposium and the Marr School  Recently  VMIRL co sponsored the establishment of the Center for Glass Chemistry within the VMI Chemistry Department and the Journal of Undergraduate Research  The VMIRL administers the Stanley

Preston Library Parents Council VMI Parents Council The VMI Parents Council was formed in 1957 to provide information and assistance to the parents of cadets attending VMI  Members of the Parents Council are selected from parents of cadets in the upper three classes  The purposes of the Parents Council are to develop closer ties between parents and VMI  to help parents serve as ambassadors for VMI  and to assist the Institute in providing for the welfare and development of cadets  The Council is to be a sounding board to help cadets and their families gain the most from VMI  If the Council can help a parent understand VMI and provide a ready source of information to all cadets and parents  then it has met its challenge  The Parents Council meets formally twice a year at VMI  The fall meeting is held on Parents Weekend  Council representatives regularly attend VMI events to answer questions and act as hosts and hostesses  VMI Research Laboratories The VMI Research Laboratories was established in 1963 as a private non profit Virginia Corporation to encourage and promote faculty research  It fosters educational objectives by supporting scientific investigation and contractual research  Since cadets assist faculty members  activities of the Research Laboratories help to teach research techniques  Policies of the Corporation are established and carried out by a 15 man Board of Directors  The Chairman of the Board is Colonel Victor J  Bernet  M D  of Olney  Maryland and the Director of Research is Dr  Richard A  Rowe  Professor of Biology  During 2007 2008 twelve faculty members and several cadets were employed part time on contracts totaling in excess of  2 610 197 and dealing with areas including chemoresponses  modeling of glass forming processes  wastewater

the parents of cadets attending VMI  Members of the Parents Council are selected from parents of cadets in the upper three classes  The purposes of the Parents Council are to develop closer ties between parents and VMI  to help parents serve as ambassadors for VMI  and to assist the Institute in providing for the welfare and development of cadets  The Council is to be a sounding board to help cadets and their families gain the most from VMI  If the Council can help a parent understand VMI and provide a ready source of information to all cadets and parents  then it has met its challenge  The Parents Council meets formally twice a year at VMI  The fall meeting is held on Parents Weekend  Council representatives regularly attend VMI events to answer questions and act as hosts and hostesses  VMI Research Laboratories The VMI Research Laboratories was established in 1963 as a private non profit Virginia Corporation to encourage and promote faculty research  It fosters

the parents of cadets attending VMI  Members of the Parents Council are selected from parents of cadets in the upper three classes  The purposes of the Parents Council are to develop closer ties between parents and VMI  to help parents serve as ambassadors for VMI  and to assist the Institute in providing for the welfare and development of cadets  The Council is to be a sounding board to help cadets and their families gain the most from VMI  If the Council can help a parent understand VMI and provide a ready source of information to all cadets and parents  then it has met its challenge  The Parents Council meets formally twice a year at VMI  The fall meeting is held on Parents Weekend  Council representatives regularly attend VMI events to answer questions and act as hosts and hostesses  VMI Research Laboratories The VMI Research Laboratories was established in 1963 as a private non profit Virginia Corporation to encourage and promote faculty research  It fosters

Moody Hall Class Agents Program Other VMI Museum McKethan Park Preston Library Parents Council VMI Parents Council The VMI Parents Council was formed in 1957 to provide information and assistance to the parents of cadets attending VMI  Members of the Parents Council are selected from parents of cadets in the upper three classes  The purposes of the Parents Council are to develop closer ties between parents and VMI  to help parents serve as ambassadors for VMI  and to assist the Institute in providing for the welfare and development of cadets  The Council is to be a sounding board to help cadets and their families gain the most from VMI  If the Council can help a parent understand VMI and provide a ready source of information to all cadets and parents  then it has met its challenge  The Parents Council meets formally twice a year at VMI  The fall meeting is held on Parents Weekend  Council representatives regularly attend VMI events to answer questions and act as hosts and hostesses  VMI Research Laboratories The VMI Research Laboratories was established in 1963 as a private non profit Virginia Corporation to encourage and promote faculty research  It fosters
