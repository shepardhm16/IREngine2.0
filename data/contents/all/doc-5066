Homepage Military Tradition The military system characterizes and distinguishes life at VMI  It fosters punctuality  order  discipline  courtesy  and respect for authority  By placing all cadets on a uniform plane  it enables them to advance through self reliance  initiative  and strength of character  Cadets live within a military framework  they wear the cadet uniform  live in barracks  and eat their meals in a mess hall  The typical day is strictly regimented and requires close attention to detail to manage the available time to ensure necessary academic  military  and physical training requirements are properly completed  Specific military training is provided both from within the cadet regiment  commanded and administered largely by cadets  and by the various armed services through the Reserve Officer Training Corps detachments located at VMI  Military Homepage VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index
