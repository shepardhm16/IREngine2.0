military has left little to chance and thus has distinctive and concise expressions of military courtesy  To give merely a perfunctory or grudging display  or worse yet a slovenly display  even if the motions are technically correct  is in fact discourteous  One must remember that the courtesy which marks military ceremonies has a profound meaning  A salute to the flag is not an upper body exercise or just another annoying rule to follow  it is a declaration of loyalty to these United States and to the principles of liberty and justice on which the Nation was founded  When a military person presents arms at retreat or salutes a senior  it is a recognition of the organized authority of the Nation  as represented by the military services which are charged with its protection  Since antiquity  men of arms have rendered some form of salute as an exchange of greeting  Although the origins of saluting have been lost  since as early as the Age of Chivalry  it was in common practice  During that period  the knights were mounted and wore steel armor and mail which completely covered their body  When two friendly knights met  it was the custom for each to raise his visor and expose his face to the other  This was always done with the right hand  It was a significant gesture as it exposed the features and also removed the right hand  the sword hand  from the vicinity of the weapon  Later  during the Middle Ages  men of means often wore heavy capes under which swords were carried  Upon meeting a friend  the cloak was thrown back by raising the right hand  thus disclosing that the right hand was not on the sword hilt  These gestures came to be recognized as proper greeting among soldiers  and were continued even as swords and mail became a thing of the past  The military salute is today  as it has been for ages  a unique exchange of greeting between military men and women Military Courtesy Courtesy is the expression of consideration for others  The military
