planning process by  encouraging their cadet to think about career fields of interest early and often  This entails having an open mind when your cadet considers careers that might not parallel parental expectations  Your cadet has to find a career field that matches his her interests  values  skills  and talents in order to experience satisfaction during the majority of his her waking hours for the next 50 years  familiarizing themselves with the suggested Office of Career Services Four year Plan for Cadets reminding their cadet about the steps to take each semester  exercising patience
