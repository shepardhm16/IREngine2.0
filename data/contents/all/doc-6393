spring furlough    Photo courtesy of Capt  Beth Stefanik  LEXINGTON  Va  March 31  2014   Five cadets representing all four of VMI s ROTC units spent nine days during last month s spring furlough in Europe studying allied military leadership  Maj  John Matsui  assistant professor of history  led the group on an Olmsted Foundation short term cultural immersion program to investigate allied cooperation and conflict from 1815 to 2015  The group visited the United Kingdom and Belgium  immersing themselves in the culture and politics of allied military leadership during the Napoleanic wars  as well as World War I and World War II  In addition to visiting the Belgian battlefields of Waterloo and Ypres  cadets Phillip Kroke  14  Elizabeth Pryor  14  Ryan McDaniel  14  Joshua Phillips  14  and Kord Pauley  14 toured the Churchill war rooms  the cruiser HMS Belfast and the British Museum in London  and met with World War I scholar Hew Strachan at Oxford University  In Belgium  the group also met with American military personnel at NATO headquarters to observe how allied military leadership functions in the 21st century   The trip combined the best qualities of the practical and theoretical study of history and military strategy  noted Matsui   The battlefield visits to Waterloo and Ypres in Belgium enabled us to get a general s eye view of the terrain that multinational coalitions contested in 1815 and 1915   In contrast  our visits to Oxford University and NATO headquarters provided the cadets with the opportunity to pick the brains of scholars and serving officers in the U S  Army as to the past and present importance of a proper understanding of strategy as applicable to both politics and warfare  added Matsui  To prepare for their experiences  cadets read chapters on Waterloo and the Somme in John Keegan s The Face of Battle and supplemental literature on the poetry and literature written by officers and inspired by World War I  Cadets also familiarized themselves with the working relationship between British and American generals during World War II   History came to life  noted Phillips upon his return   Reading about it in a book or
