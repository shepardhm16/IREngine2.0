Mathematics The Mathematical Century   The 30 Greatest Problems of the Last 100 Years by Piergiorgio Odifreddi  Arturo Sangalli  Translator  Call Number  QA26  O3513 2004 ISBN  069109294X Publication Date  2004 03 08  The twentieth century was a time of unprecedented development in mathematics  as well as in all sciences  more theorems were proved and results found in a hundred years than in all of previous history  In The Mathematical Century  Piergiorgio Odifreddi distills this unwieldy mass of knowledge into a fascinating and authoritative overview of the subject  He concentrates on thirty highlights of pure and applied mathematics  Each tells the story of an exciting problem  from its historical origins to its modern solution  in lively prose free of technical details    Book Jacket The extreme level of abstraction and generality that characterizes contemporary mathematics renders much of the enormous wealth of this period inaccessible to historians who are not mathematicians themselves  Among the highlights of the past century are the following ones  with implications that are beginning to be felt in physics  cosmology and philosophy  Category theory  topos theory  algebraic geometry and cohomology theories  Mathematics  The New Golden Age by Keith J  Devlin Call Number  QA93  D46 1999 ISBN  0231116381 This text  offers a glimpse of the extraordinary vistas and bizarre universes opened up by contemporary mathematicians  Hilbert s tenth problem and the four color theorem  Gaussian integers  chaotic dynamics and the Mandelbrot set  infinite numbers  and strange number systems  Why a  new golden age  According to Keith Devlin  we are currently witnessing an astronomical amount of mathematical research and  he leads the reader into the heart of the most interesting mathematical perplexities   from the biggest known prime number to the Shimura Taniyama conjecture for Fermat s Last Theorem    Book Jacket VMI Reference Librarian Janet Holly Email

100 Years by Piergiorgio Odifreddi  Arturo Sangalli  Translator  Call Number  QA26  O3513 2004 ISBN  069109294X Publication Date  2004 03 08  The twentieth century was a time of unprecedented development in mathematics  as well as in all sciences  more theorems were proved and results found in a hundred years than in all of previous history  In The Mathematical Century  Piergiorgio Odifreddi distills this unwieldy mass of knowledge into a fascinating and authoritative overview of the subject  He concentrates on thirty highlights of pure and applied mathematics  Each tells the story of an exciting problem  from its historical origins to its modern solution  in lively prose free of technical details    Book Jacket The extreme level of abstraction and generality that characterizes contemporary mathematics renders much of the enormous wealth of this period inaccessible to historians who are not mathematicians themselves  Among the highlights of the past century are the following ones  with implications that are beginning to be felt in physics  cosmology and philosophy  Category theory  topos theory  algebraic geometry and cohomology theories  Mathematics  The New Golden Age by Keith J  Devlin Call Number  QA93  D46 1999 ISBN  0231116381 This text  offers a glimpse of the extraordinary vistas and bizarre universes opened up by contemporary mathematicians
