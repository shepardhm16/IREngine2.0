Project Tests Load Bearing Capacities for Timber Framing Construction Summer Research Project Tests Load Bearing Capacities for Timber Framing Construction Giustino Iuliano  16 may be new to civil engineering  but he hasn t wasted any time getting hands on experience in his major field  This summer  he s working alongside Col  Grigg Mullen 76  professor of civil engineering  to test the load bearing capacity of floor joists used in traditional timber framing construction  The project is part of a larger effort by Mullen  a timber framing expert  to contribute to the knowledge base of that ancient art so information about the load bearing capability of beams can be included in modern building codes   Historical precedent works  but modern building code folks want proof  said Mullen  who s been involved with timber framing for over 15 years   As an engineer  we need something to hang our hats on instead of   Well  it s always been OK  To help expand the knowledge base for types of wood commonly found in Virginia  Iuliano is testing 12 foot timbers cut from four tree species  white pine  white oak  red oak  and poplar  For each type of wood  Iuliano is testing joists cut at three depths  two inches  three inches  and four inches  Moisture is a critical component in determining the strength of wood  so Iuliano measures the moisture content of each timber by weighing a sample  drying it in an oven and weighing it again afterward   Historically timber frames are built with green wood  so the frame is weakest when it s first assembled  said Mullen  Left to dry on their own  added Mullen  heavy timbers such as those Iuliano are testing could take up to a decade to dry completely  The oven simply speeds the process  he explained  so moisture content can be part of Iuliano s calculations  So far  Iuliano has found that the wood is losing a quarter or more of its weight in the oven  While the small pieces of wood are drying  Iuliano tests the timbers themselves  Using a jack similar to one used to lift an automobile  Iuliano applies pressure to each piece of wood for 20 minutes to measure how much stress the wood can take before cracking   We add pressure as a wind load  Iuliano explained  A load cell attached to the jack records the amount of pressure applied in each test  So far  Iuliano has found that the strongest of the massive timbers   a piece of white oak with a four inch joist cut   withstood 28 000 pounds of pressure  By contrast  a piece of white pine with a two inch cut failed at only 6 000 pounds  A typical residence  said Mullen  is usually designed to take about 2 000 pounds of pressure   That s when you re having a frat party and everybody s dancing  he added  Mullen and Iuliano plan to present the results of their work at a meeting of the Timber Framers Engineering Council  to be held Aug  7 in Burlington  Vt   The goal  of that organization  is to get timber framing covered in the design codes  said Mullen  He continued   The standard 2 x 4 construction stuff is well covered by the codes  It s the green heavy timber that drives the building code folks nuts  The longevity of timber frame buildings is not in question  On a trip to England  Mullen once visited inside a timber frame church built in A D  600  If you keep a roof on it  it ll stand forever  he said  By  Mary Price IR   July 2013 VMI Foundation
