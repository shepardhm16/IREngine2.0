Dave Grossman  who has had profound influence on how we think about war today  as part of the H B  Johnson  Jr   26 Distinguished Lecture Series  The talk took place this morning in Marshall Hall s Gillis Theater  Grossman has been a psychology professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point  a professor of military science  and an Army Ranger  Since retiring from the Army in 1998  he has pioneered the science of  killology    the study of the act of killing   publishing several books and articles on the subject  He stated succinctly the relevance of his topic   If you think combat is supposed to destroy you  then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy  he said  During his talk  Grossman set out to dispel two myths about combat that he said are found in the media

people like that    but you must believe the vast majority of people are made stronger by combat  Grossman pointed to the World War II veterans who returned home and became the  Greatest Generation  Grossman also called out the news media for selective reporting of data  One example he used was the report that 30 to 40 percent of veterans had post traumatic stress disorder   PTSD   leaving out the key words  some symptoms   Having some symptoms is not PTSD   it s normal  Grossman said  explaining that the more realistic number was 8 percent  Although Grossman said the number of veterans with PTSD is lower than the American people are led to believe  he did not discount the need for treatment of the condition  That s why  in fact  the myth of the  macho man or gal   is a problem   We have got to create an environment in which it is OK to get help  he said  He noted that hundreds of thousands of service personnel have been treated for PTSD and have recovered  They re stronger for the experience  he said  Although the subject of Grossman s books is killing  he said the ultimate goal is healing  At the conclusion of his presentation  Grossman posed a question from the novel  Gates of Fire  about the Spartans at Thermopylae   What is the opposite of fear  What quenches fear as water quenches fire  he asked  The answer he offered is  love  He encouraged cadets to go out and

Psychologist  Talks to Cadets about Coping with War LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  20  2014   Cadets had the opportunity to hear from Lt  Col  Dave Grossman  who has had profound influence on how we think about war today  as part of the H B  Johnson  Jr   26 Distinguished Lecture Series  The talk took place this morning in Marshall Hall s Gillis Theater  Grossman has been a psychology professor at the United States Military Academy at West Point  a professor of military science  and an Army Ranger  Since retiring from the Army in 1998  he has pioneered the science of  killology    the study of the act of killing   publishing several books and articles on the subject  He stated succinctly the relevance of his topic   If you think combat is supposed to destroy you  then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy  he said  During his talk  Grossman set out to dispel two myths about combat that he said are found in the media  television  and film   what he called the  pity party  and the  macho man or gal   Hollywood loves the pity party  he observed   Tormented  haunted veterans that come home scarred for life  There are people like that    but you must believe the vast majority of people are made stronger by combat  Grossman pointed to the World War II veterans who returned home and became the  Greatest Generation  Grossman also called out the news media for selective reporting of data  One example he used was the report that 30 to 40 percent of veterans had post traumatic stress disorder   PTSD   leaving out the key words  some symptoms   Having some symptoms is not PTSD   it s normal  Grossman said  explaining that the more realistic number was 8 percent  Although Grossman said the number of veterans with PTSD is lower than the American people are led to believe  he did not discount the need for treatment of the condition  That s why  in fact  the myth of the  macho man or gal   is a problem   We have got to create an environment in which it is OK to get help  he said  He noted that hundreds of thousands of service personnel have been treated for PTSD and have recovered  They re stronger for the experience  he said  Although the subject of Grossman s books is
