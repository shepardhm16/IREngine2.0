robust undergraduate research program doesn t just happen  It thrives  and thrives only because at VMI we get a whole lot of help from our friends  Case in point  Maj  Anne Alerding s project to develop clean burning biofuel from stem residues of prolific soybean plants whose beans have already been harvested for food  Alerding s is one of few biofuel projects that use a common agricultural plant yet do not compete with the plant s use for food   and two cadets are benefitting from extensive work in the lab this year  with many more to benefit in the future as this long range  many faceted project continues  Making it all happen are grants from sources both public and private totaling  150 776   This is beyond my dreams    This is a world class lab now  it s competitive with any you d find at U Va  or Virginia Tech  said Alerding   We re well equipped  Located in a recently renovated portion of Maury Brooke Hall  a renovation project still under way  Alerding s lab has benefitted first from funding for the renovation  which included  66 500 for an ultra performance liquid chromatography system  UPLC  enabling Alerding  and Cadet Garrett Parsons  15  to measure cell wall chemicals in soybean stems  For biology major Parsons  the project has introduced a whole new way of thinking about plants   The combination of biology   the cellulose  the hemicellulose    and  the breakdown through acid hydrolysis   was an introduction for me from biology into chemistry  He entered his first chemistry class this fall a few steps ahead of his classmates after a summer working in Alerding s lab on a stipend funded by a  20 000 renewable grant from the Jeffress Memorial Trust  That grant funded Alerding s own salary over the summer  as well as travel for her and Cadet Matthew Waalkes  13 to several conferences  a  1 300 muffle furnace for measuring cell wall chemistry in soybean powder  a  1 700 column heater and computer for the UPLC machine   6 500 for consumable lab supplies  and salaries and stipends for research this summer  Waalkes  too  has learned to think a whole new way about science   In a textbook there are a lot of certainties  said Waalkes  a biology major with minors in chemistry and writing   But in a research lab  you start to realize that science is full of uncertainties  It becomes much more interesting  it becomes much more exciting  Waalkes has been studying the tissues of the soybean stem through digital microscopy using the biology department s Nikon Eclipse 80i research microscope  He analyzes the tissues using ImageJ software developed by the National Institutes of Health  He analyzes those results using Mathematica  with advice from math department head Col  Troy Siemers  Waalkes  work on the project includes a Summer Undergraduate Research Institute   SURI   project and travel to present in the graduate student division at the American Society of Plant Biologists Southern Section Regional meeting  both through the Jackson Hope Fund  study of soybean slides prepared through a contract funded by a Jackson Hope New Directions in Teaching and Research Grant  and a Swope summer research stipend funded by the VMI Foundation s Watkins Southard Fund  Alerding s research began two years ago with the selection and planting of five soybean cultivars  It will continue this summer with the bioengineering of the best of these to produce the cleanest possible fuel and with extensive testing and development by Maj  Tim Moore  97 and his cadets in his lab  Both studies are part of VMI s Clean Energy and Air Resources   CLEAR   Program  a project that received a  40 000 Dominion Resources Higher Education Partnership Grant last year  Alerding s work has been supported by a Wetmore Fund grant to Parsons  VMI Foundation Grants in Aid of Research funding  Virginia Equipment Trust Fund money  the Carroll Fund  and funding provided by the dean s office  all of which is supporting work that is cutting edge both in its procedures and in the interdisciplinary nature of its subject  It all started for Alerding  after all  when she was approached by Moore  an assistant professor of civil engineering who studies pollutants  looking for a collaborator to work with him on a submission in response to a call for proposals on biofuel research   I was approached by a civil engineer on a problem   he didn t know much about plants  and I didn t know much about making biofuel  said Alerding   We put it together from there  Alerding continued   There s a new wave in research for interdisciplinary problem solving  And  thanks to a lot of help from sources both public and private  VMI s riding the crest  By   Sherri Tombarge IR   Feb  2013 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
