Referencing Papers The bookmarks below have been arranged to provide an introduction to the History Department and basic information about the study of history at VMI  Guidelines for Referencing Papers Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Types of References and Notes Bibliographies Other Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  Vol  10  No  3  Fall 1997  299 315  Vandervort  Bruce  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press  2009  Davis  Thomas W   The Influence of Richard Price on the Burke Paine Debates  Proceedings of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 19  1989  800 806  For more information on referencing  see  Kate L  Turabian  A Manual for Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation

Sources  Types of References and Notes Bibliographies Other Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  Vol  10  No  3  Fall 1997  299 315  Vandervort  Bruce  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press  2009  Davis  Thomas W   The Influence of Richard Price on the Burke Paine Debates  Proceedings of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 19  1989  800 806  For more information on referencing  see  Kate L  Turabian  A Manual for Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation about writing mechanics and grammar  see Diana Hackett s  A Pocket Style

Papers Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Types of References and Notes Bibliographies Other Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the

primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  Vol  10  No  3  Fall 1997  299 315  Vandervort  Bruce  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press  2009  Davis  Thomas W   The Influence of Richard Price on the Burke Paine Debates  Proceedings of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 19  1989  800 806  For more information on referencing  see  Kate L  Turabian  A Manual for Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation

Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and

Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation about writing mechanics and grammar  see Diana Hackett s  A Pocket Style Manual  for help with your style  consult William Strunk and E  B

Acknowledge Your Sources  Types of References and Notes Bibliographies Other Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  Vol  10  No  3  Fall 1997  299 315  Vandervort  Bruce  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press  2009  Davis  Thomas W   The Influence of Richard Price on the Burke Paine Debates  Proceedings of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 19  1989  800 806  For more information on referencing  see  Kate L  Turabian  A Manual for Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation

  Academics   Areas of Study   Arts   Humanities   History   Guidelines for Referencing Papers Guidelines for Referencing Papers The bookmarks below have been arranged to provide an introduction to the History Department and basic information about the study of history at VMI  Guidelines for Referencing Papers Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Types of References and Notes Bibliographies Other Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and

Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation about writing mechanics and grammar  see Diana Hackett s  A Pocket Style Manual  for help with your style  consult William Strunk and E  B

in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  Vol  10  No  3  Fall 1997  299 315  Vandervort  Bruce  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press  2009  Davis  Thomas W   The Influence of Richard Price on the Burke Paine Debates  Proceedings of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 19  1989  800 806  For more information on referencing  see  Kate L  Turabian  A Manual for Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a verb   Wrong   Mary plays squash good  Right   She plays it well  Pronoun  Use  who whom  when referring to people   that which  for others  Hyphen with century  Insert a hyphen when you use a century term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation about writing mechanics and grammar  see Diana Hackett s  A Pocket Style Manual  for help with your style  consult William Strunk and E  B

References and Notes Bibliographies Other Useful Guidelines for Writing Papers in History Courses Descriptive vs  Analytic Writing General Format   Presentation Organization   Paragraph Structure Acknowledging Sources Primary vs  Secondary Sources Use of Direct Quotations Writing in Formal English Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources  Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking  Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action  B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project  Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format  Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point  Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper  The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style  The first reference to a book  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus  Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53  Bruce Vandervort  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  London  University College of London Press  1998  1 12  The first reference to an article in a journal  The author s name  with first name s  before last name  followed by a comma  the title of article in quotation marks with a comma before the closing quotation mark  the title of the journal underlined or in italics with no comma after it  the volume number of the journal  the year of publication in parentheses followed by a comma and a space  and the page numbers  Thus  Spencer C  Tucker   The Carronade  The Nautical Research Journal 42 1  April 1997  40 44  A  Cash Koeniger   Climate and Southern Distinctiveness  Journal of Southern History 54  February  1988  21 44  David W  Coffey  ed   Into the Valley of Virginia  The 1852 Travel Account of Curran Swaim Virginia Cavalcade 40  Summer 1990  14 27  Bruce Vandervort   Nouvelles perspectives sur Victor Griffuelhes  Le Mouvement Social  172  juillet septembre  1995  51 62  A multi volume set  In the simplest case  after the parenthesis and the comma  say which volume you used  followed by a colon  and then the page s  E g  Statutes of the Realm  London  Her Majesty s Stationery Office  1879  4 24 7  For more complex cases  see the Turabian Manual cited below  A component part by one author in a work by another  Give the author and title of the chapter or article you used  then  in  followed by the name of the volume  List the editor s name after the title  before the parenthesis  The rest is as for other books  Kenneth E  Koons   The Staple of Our Country  Wheat in the Regional Farm Economy of the Nineteenth Century Valley of Virginia  in After the Backcountry  Rural Life in the Great Valley of Virginia 1800 1900 Kenneth E  Koons and Warren R  Hofstra  Knoxville  The University of Tennessee Press  2000  2 44  Kenneth E  Koons   The Colored Laborers Work as Well as When Slaves  African Americans in the Breadbasket of the Confederacy  1850 1880  in To Peel This Earth  Historical Archaeology and the War Between the States  ed  Clarence R  Geier and Stephen Potter  Miami University Press of Florida  2000  Translated works  Give the translator s name after the title  before the parenthesis  E g  Author  Title  trans  Henry Jones  New York  etc  A collective note might be worded as follows  All information in this paragraph is drawn from Jane Osikawa  Women in the Japanese Textile Industry  1880 1954  Berkeley  CA  Univ  of California Press  1985  64 78  and Nagato Takeuchi  Earl  Japanese Linen Production  Tokyo  Masakawi Press  1962  209 51  Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources  Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced  1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136  2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii  Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts  Minutes 1786 90 and 1827 8   London  London Record Society  1978  Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work  First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note  Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams  English Reform Literature of the Sixteenth Century  Boston  Little Brown  1991  523  Henry VIII  letter to Charles V  date and reference not provided  as cited by Lucille Careless  Early European Diplomacy  Paris  Drois  1897  76  Later references to a work already cited  After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70  The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used  Consecutive references to the same work  If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus  1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39  2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again  3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2  References to interviews  If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines  C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject  Format For a Bibliography  Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography  The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper  A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries  If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately  Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered  The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes  If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses  Article format is the same as for notes  except that the author s last name comes first  the author s name is followed by a period  and the title of the journal is followed by a period  Books or articles for which no author was given should be listed under title  When describing a book  do not give the page numbers of the sections you used  The page numbers of articles in journals or chapters in books should  however  be given  Examples  Sheldon  Rose Mary   Clandestine Operations and Covert Action  The Roman Imperative International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence  Vol  10  No  3  Fall 1997  299 315  Vandervort  Bruce  Wars of Imperial Conquest in Africa  1830 1914  Bloomington  IN  Indiana University Press  2009  Davis  Thomas W   The Influence of Richard Price on the Burke Paine Debates  Proceedings of the Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 19  1989  800 806  For more information on referencing  see  Kate L  Turabian  A Manual for Writers of Term Papers  Other Useful Guidelines for Papers A  Descriptive Writing vs  An Analytic or Critical Approach Descriptive writing merely says what happened or what another author has discussed  it provides an account of the topic  An analytic  or critical  approach asks and answers questions  makes comparisons  and presents and defends a thesis or argument  Rather than just stating the facts  this approach explains and interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the topic or issue about which you are writing and to argue a thesis or conclusion  Be sure that you understand what each assignment requires  in terms of the balance between description  analysis  and argument  You must provide evidence and examples to buttress your analysis and arguments  If you encounter material that does not agree with your position  you cannot just ignore it  instead you need to explain why you think that evidence is less important or persuasive  B  General Format and Presentation The paper s title  your name  the course number  and the date should appear on a separate first page for long papers and at the top of the first page of text for short papers  Your paper needs an introduction  a middle section  and a conclusion  These sections do not need to be set off with individual headings in a short paper but may be separated in a longer one  The introduction lays out your topic  states what your particular thesis or argument will be  and tells your reader how the paper will be structured what points you will consider  You may also need to provide some background or context in the introduction  The middle section presents your information and develops your analysis and argument  The conclusion pulls together the main points  reasserts the thesis  and may relate the topic back to wider historical issues  Number the pages so your instructor can refer to them  Depending on the nature of the assignment  your paper may need footnotes  at the bottom of the page  or endnotes  at the back of the paper  It will almost certainly need at the end bibliography of the works you used for the project  See the Referencing Guidelines  Unless your instructor has given you other instructions  type your papers double spaced  with margins of standard width  usually 1 inch on the sides and bottom and 1 1 2 inch on the top  Use standard fonts  Professors are fully aware that different fonts may be used to make a paper seem larger or smaller than it really is  Also  exotic fonts may be hard to read and grade  Indent the start of each paragraph 5 spaces from the left margin  Proofread your paper carefully for spelling and typing mistakes  A sloppy paper distracts attention from what you are saying and makes the reader wonder if your preparation for the paper and your thinking were careless too  If your word processor has a spell checker  use it  but remember that it will not catch typos that happen to be words  e g   marital  vs   martial  Correct any last minute changes neatly in ink  Staple your paper together  not paper clips or folded at one corner  Keep a copy of your paper  either on disk or photocopied  If your instructor has given any special instructions about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them  C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions  Between sections you will need a transition or linking statement  indicating that you are moving on to a new topic  Each paragraph within a section should also be clearly related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition  D  Acknowledging Your Sources  Referencing  and Academic Honesty You must acknowledge the sources of all your information and any ideas or interpretations you have taken from other works  These references are usually placed into notes  with a bibliography at the end of the paper that lists all works used  See the Referencing Guidelines above  Plagiarism  This serious academic offense can take many forms  including using another writer s phrase without putting it into quotation marks  not giving the source for a quotation  taking information from other works without acknowledgment  presenting other people s ideas as if they were your own  or submitting a paper that you did not write  You may not use a paper you wrote for one course to fill an assignment in another class  E  Primary Sources vs  Secondary Works A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on  F  Use of Direct Quotations When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly  G  Writing in Formal English While most of us speak in casual or colloquial English  it is important to learn how to write formal English too  Our normal conversational style differs in many respects from formal written English  Your ability to write effectively will be one of the most critical factors in getting a job or being accepted for further training  Hence it is worth working on your formal writing skills while you are in college  H  Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Misspelled words  Use dictionary  and or spelling checker  and correct  Typing error s  Proofread more carefully and correct  Contraction  Do not use contractions  e g   wasn t  or  isn t  in formal writing  Commas omitted or in wrong place  Set off every parenthetical phrase  one that could be put into parentheses or removed from the sentence  by a pair of commas  one before and one after it  Use a comma after each item in a sequence of three or more items including the next to last   E g   The Velociraptor likes apples  oranges  and pears  Capitalization incorrect  Possessives  Insert an apostrophe when a noun is used as a possessive   E g   the dog s ear  or  the girls  running shoes  Do not use an apostrophe for  its  as a possessive   E g   The dog shook its head   It s  with an apostrophe is a contraction of  it is  and hence should not be used in formal writing  Prepositions  Check the phrase marked for an incorrect preposition  Reword to avoid a preposition at the end of the sentence   Wrong   That is an idea I have never thought about  Better   That is an idea I have never considered  or  I have never thought about that idea  Dangling participle  Reword to eliminate an opening or closing phrase with no subject or the wrong one  When a sentence starts with a participle  the  understood  subject of the participle must be the same as the first word  subject  of the main clause that follows   Wrong   Flying through the trees  John watched the lovely bird   This means that John was flying  Correct usage   Checking through his notes  Buford decided to focus on the problem of low intensity conflict  Adverbs vs  adjectives  Use an adverb  not an adjective  to modify a

term to modify a noun   E g   important to seventeenth century science  If the century term stands alone  do not use a hyphen   E g   in the fifth century  Wrong word or nonexistent word  Check a dictionary to be sure this word exists and what its meaning is  Verb tense  Use the past tense  not the present  for historical descriptions  Stay in the same tense throughout a given discussion  Disagreement between singular and plural forms in verbs or pronouns Subject and verb   E g   He and his dog walk  not  He and his dog walks  Noun and pronoun   Wrong   The country went to war when an enemy attacked them  Right        when an enemy attacked it  Parallel wording  When using the constructions  both       and  or  not only     also  use the same grammatical form after each of those terms  That is  the word or phrase immediately following both terms must be a subject  a verb  or a prepositional phrase   Wrong   Naboru likes both dancing and a quiet evening at home  Right   Naboru likes both dancing and having a quiet evening at home  Run on sentence  Do not join two separate sentences by a comma  To solve this problem  either   1  add a conjunction  e g   and   but   or   2  substitute a semi colon for the comma  or  3  divide it into two sentences using a period in the middle  Incomplete sentence  Reword this phrase so that it becomes a full sentence  with a subject and a main verb  Unclear meaning  Undefined term  Make clear to your reader what exact definition you intend when using this term  which can be used in a variety of different ways  Unclear reference  Re write to indicate to whom or what this word refers  Be especially careful with  this  and  that  Confusing wording  Re write so as to communicate a clear point to your reader  so that no one can misunderstand you  Idea cannot be followed because it is undeveloped  Explain and discuss this point more fully  Wordiness  Eliminate unnecessary language  see how briefly you can express this point  Awkward phrasing  Re write to convert this lumpy  uncomfortable wording into a smoother statement  Repetitious wording  Vary your wording to add interest  rather than using the same terms or phrases several times within a few paragraphs  as you have done here  Passive voice  Re write to avoid passive wordings  which are often imprecise  wordy  and or wimpy  further  they seldom say who committed the action   E g Many orders were issued  Use the active voice to achieve a more direct and forceful statement   E g   The Queen Mother of Benin issued many orders  Indirect opening phrase  Re word for a more vigorous effect  eliminating round about or vague opening phrases like  there is are was were  or  it seems that  Repetition of ideas information  Do not state the same point twice  Discuss each idea or topic fully in one part of your paper  then move on  delete unnecessary repetition  Overly broad generalization  Stick to the evidence you have before you  that you can defend effectively  Gender specific  or sexist  language  In contemporary American usage  we no longer follow the traditional but biased practice of using masculine nouns and pronouns to refer to everyone  Instead  we try to use  gender neutral  language  finding wordings that are inclusive or introduce both male and female terms   Biased   Every student is responsible for his own schedule  Recast   Every student is responsible for his or her own schedule  or  better   Students are responsible for their own schedules  For more explanation about writing mechanics and grammar  see Diana Hackett s  A Pocket Style

Common Problems in Writing Mechanics and Style Guidelines for Referencing Paper Guidelines for Referencing Paper A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources A  Why Acknowledge Your Sources Every paper that you submit should be based upon your own research and analysis  Any factual material or ideas you take from another source must be acknowledged in a reference  unless it is common knowledge  e g  President Kennedy was killed in 1963  This is normally done through a combination of notes and a bibliography  Your method of referencing must tell your reader where you got all the specific information in your paper  and where any ideas or interpretations came from that are not your own thinking Plagiarism consists of presenting another person s words  research  or ideas as if they were your own  This applies not only to direct quotations  each of which must be placed in quotation marks and have its own reference  but also to the use of facts  interpretations  or approaches you have gained from someone else s work  Any information or ideas you have taken from another book  article  or person must therefore be referenced too  Submitting a paper written by another student or one you ordered from a catalog is likewise plagiarism  The Institute treats plagiarism as a serious academic offense  and your instructor is obliged to impose severe punishments should this problem occur  plus report cases to the Department Chairman who will pass it on to the Dean s Office for possible Honor Court action B  Types of Reference and Notes B  Types of Reference and Notes Different styles of referencing are used in different disciplines  The one most commonly found in historical writing utilizes notes  placed either at the bottom of the page as footnotes or at the back of the paper as endnotes  coupled with a bibliography at the end that lists all the works used for the project Historians do not normally use a format that gives references in the text  with the author s name and a reference put into parentheses  Occasionally  however  an instructor may suggest that you use this style  especially if your paper is a discussion of just a few works  In that case you need also to provide in a bibliography the full reference to every work cited  Do not use references in the text unless your instructor has approved this format Use of notes Use of notes Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text  Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources  Even then  however  any direct quotation within the paragraph will need its own reference in addition to the collective note  Notes to provide supplementary material   Another use of notes is to provide additional information or comment  facts or explanations which you feel would interrupt the flow of your discussion in the text itself  You could  for example  offer evidence to support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point Simple notes  They provide a reference to the source for the material  interpretation  or direct quotation given in the text Simple notes Collective notes  To avoid the extreme case of having a note at the end of every sentence or two  you can put a collective note at the end either of the first sentence or of the last sentence of a given paragraph  indicating where the material in that paragraph comes from  if it is taken from just a few sources

support a statement made in the text  or you could explain why you are not persuaded by another historian s differing argument on this point Notes to provide supplementary material Format for notes Format for notes Type the number of the note at the end of the sentence to which it applies normally up half a space above the line of text  The notes themselves are usually typed single spaced  with double spaces between them  Notes may be placed either at the bottom of each page  footnotes  or all together at the end of the paper  endnotes  If the notes are on the same page as the text  they may either be numbered consecutively throughout the paper or start again with number one on each new page  Notes at the end of the paper must be numbered in sequence throughout the paper The most important features of notes are  1  that they provide the necessary information  2  in a consistent format  The information to be given the first time you refer to a given printed work is  author s full name  title of the work  publication information in parentheses  and the page s  which you are citing  There are several acceptable formats used by historians  Unless your instructor tells you to do something different  use the following style  It is drawn from the Turabian Manual cited below  based upon The Chicago Manual of Style The Chicago Manual of Style The first reference to a book The first reference to a book The author s name  with first name s  before last name  the title of the book underlined or in italics  the town in which the book was published followed by a colon and two spaces  then the publisher followed by a comma and a space  then the date of publication  with all of this publication information enclosed within parentheses  and finally if the place of publication is a U S  city that is not generally known  give a brief state abbreviation too  Thus Eric W  Osborne  Britain s Economic Blockade of Germany  1914 1919  London  Frank Cass  2004  52 53 Britain s

Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources Modern edition of a primary source or collection of sources Your format here must distinguish between the actual words of a primary source and any discussion written by the modern editor in her or his introduction to the work  If  for instance  you refer to a statement by Sitting Bull  your reference will normally be to the source of his own words  But if you are quoting a modern editor s comments about Sitting Bull s statement  your format must make that plain  These two cases might be referenced 1  Sitting Bull  Interview about the Ghost Dance  January 7  1890  in Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  136 Native American Voices 2  Margaret Strong Woman  introduction to Native American Voices  ed  Margaret Strong Woman  Boston  Atlantic  1983  iii Native American Voices Thomas W  Davis  ed  Committees for Repeal of the

you have cited person A through author B s work Indirect quotations  when you have cited person A through author B s work Indirect quotations First give the original author of the quotation  with the source of the quotation  its publication information  and page number  then say  cited by  or  as quoted by  and give the full reference to the book in which you found the quotation  If author B does not provide a reference saying where he or she found the quotation  indicate that absence in your own note Thomas More  Utopia  ed  Henry Smith  London  Longmans  1873  as quoted by Susan Williams

Drois  1897  76 Early European Diplomacy Later references to a work already cited Later references to a work already cited Later references to a work already cited After the first  full reference to a given work  save time and space by referring to that work in an abbreviated form  A standard format is to give the author s last name  not the first  unless you have cited works by two different authors with the same last name  when you will have to give at least their first initials as well  a short form of the title  and page number s  Thus  Thomas  Diesel  68 70 Diesel The forms  op  cit  and  loc  cit  should not be used Consecutive references to the same work Consecutive references to the same work Consecutive references to the same work If you are citing a work in one note which you cited in the note immediately before it  there is a further shortcut  Here one uses the Latin abbreviation ibid   meaning  the same  plus a new page number if the second reference is different from the page given in the previous note  Because ibid  is an abbreviation  it always needs a period  When ibid  is used in the middle of a sentence  it is not capitalized  Thus ibid 1  Stanislaus Serevski  Polish Workers in World War II  trans  Ignatius Gazda  Oxford  Blackwell  1993  39 Polish Workers in World War II 2  Ibid   With no further page number  this means p  39 again Ibid 3  For a detailed discussion of this change  see ibid  41 2 ibid References to interviews References to interviews If you are using interviews as a source for a paper  ask your instructor for a copy of the separate handout Interviewing Guidelines C  Bibliographies C  Bibliographies The Purpose of a Bibliography The Purpose of a Bibliography A bibliography should list all the books  articles  and interviews which you found helpful while doing research for your paper  even if you did not end up citing them individually in notes  It should not include works which you looked at but did not contain any useful information on your subject Format For a Bibliography Format For a Bibliography Book titles may be underlined or italicized as long as you are consistent throughout the bibliography The bibliography is placed at the very end of the paper A bibliography is generally typed single spaced within each entry but double spaced between entries If you have a long and complicated bibliography  you may want to subdivide it on the basis of primary sources and secondary materials  Books and articles should be entered together  not grouped separately Entries within a bibliography are arranged alphabetically by the author s last name and are not numbered The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes The author s last name is typed first  followed by his or her given names  the reverse of the format for notes  Use a period after the author s full name  not a comma as in notes If you list several works by a given author  arrange them alphabetically by title after the author s name  Use an underscore in place of the author s name for the second and later items to indicate the same author  Book titles are followed by a period  The publication information to be given is the same as for notes but is not put into parentheses If you list several works by a given

interprets them  Why did events take place  what were their consequences  how did they relate to other developments  Why did the authors you read take differing stands  What is your own interpretation of the issues  Few assignments in history courses will be simply descriptive  Rather than just summarizing what happened or what you read  you will usually be asked to provide your own analysis of the

about the format of the paper  be sure to follow them C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure C  Clarity of Organization and Paragraph Structure The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general subject  In each section  you will have one or more paragraphs focusing on individual aspects of that topic  A paragraph consists of a block of material about a particular subject or about a specific point  one of the issues that contributes to the development of the analysis or argument of the paper  Each paragraph should begin with a general topic sentence that indicates what subject the rest of the paragraph will discuss  what issue it will explore  or what point it will make  By reading just the topic sentences of the paper  your reader should be able to get a summary of the subjects you are addressing and the position you are defending  If your paragraph talks about several different subjects  it must either be divided up  so you can develop each point separately and effectively in its own paragraph  or be opened by a topic sentence that makes it clear that you want to mention briefly a variety of lesser points  The remaining sentences in each paragraph provide more detail or evidence about the main topic  A paragraph should develop the subject or point it is making  hence it normally contains at least three sentences in addition to the topic sentence and may have a concluding sentence as well   Here formal writing differs from journalistic style  which often uses shorter paragraphs  Transitions The body of your paper should be organized into several main sections  each of which deals with a given sub topic  issue  or question within your general

related to the one before and the one after  creating an even  logical flow  If the link is not readily apparent  you should include a sentence which describes the transition Between sections you will

or group  who participated in or witnessed the events you are studying or who provided a contemporary expression of the ideas or values of the period under examination  Letters  autobiographies  diaries  government documents  minutes of meetings  newspapers  or books written about your topic at that time are examples  non written sources include interviews  films  photos  recordings of music  and clothing  buildings  or tools from the period  Secondary works are accounts written by people who were not themselves involved in the events or in the original expression of the ideas under study  Written after the events ideas they describe  they are based upon primary sources and or other secondary works  Thus  an early 20th century historian could prepare a secondary study of the American Civil War through her reading of documents from that period  interviews with veterans  examination of weapons  and so on A primary source is a record left by a person  or group  who participated in or

general  your paper will flow better if you paraphrase the statement  putting it into your own words  Quote only when you wish to call attention to the author s precise phrasing  When using primary sources  you may want to use a few more direct quotations to illustrate the mood  language  or  flavor  of your sources  But even here  be sparing  A good rule of thumb is to quote only when you plan to analyze or interpret the passage  otherwise  paraphrase  Do not use a direct quotation as the topic sentence of a paragraph  Every direct quotation must be put into quotation marks and given its own individual reference  normally in a note  An indirect quotation is when you present a direct quotation of the words of person A that you found in a book written by author B  that is  author B was himself quoting person A  In such cases  you must give both sources in the reference that accompanies the quotation  Quotations of five or more lines need to be indented 5 8 spaces on each side and single spaced  When you use this format  do not use quotation marks  but do still give the reference in a note  Shorter quotations should be typed as part of the regular paragraph  Punctuation with quotation marks  When ending a quotation in the text  a final comma or period always precedes the closing quotation marks  whether or not it is part of the quoted matter  Question marks and exclamation marks precede the quotation marks if they are part of the quoted matter but follow the quotation marks if they are part of the entire sentence of which the quotation is a part  Thus  The newspaper reported that  150 000 young people gathered in Lexington  Should we accept its account of  a stupendous congregation  If you leave out words from a quotation  to shorten it or to make it fit into the grammar of your own sentence  indicate the omission by using periods with a space between each one  For gaps in the middle of a sentence  use three periods  for omissions at the end of the sentence  use four periods  E g   History can be fantastic         If you insert a word into a quotation  to increase clarity or adjust it to your own presentation  put the insertion into square brackets  E g  She commented that  by January        the trees  looked sickly When working with secondary accounts  limit your use of direct quotations  In general  your paper will flow better if you
