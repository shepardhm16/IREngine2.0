Study   Social Science   Economics   Business   The Major Field Test in Business The Major Field Test in Business Since 1993  the Economics   Business Department has administered the Educational Testing Service s Major Field Test in Business  MFTB  to graduating first class cadets  During the pursuit of AACSB accreditation over the past several years  MFTB results were an important component of the department s assessment of discipline based skills  When deficiencies were found  changes were made at both the curriculum and course levels  In 2010 11  fifty one members of the first class took the MFTB  Overall  the class scored in the 80th percentile  in comparison with 685 schools worldwide  In fact  the 85th percentile was only 9 10 of a point away  Individually  five cadets achieved scores above the 90th percentile and three above the 95th  compared with 181 500 students who have taken the exam  The class of 2011 scored in the 95th percentile in Economics  Marketing and Legal   Social Environment  Management and International Issues were in the 90th percentile  This was especially gratifying  because the Educational Testing Service began using a new version of the undergraduate Business exam in 2010  Although the department scrupulously avoids  teaching to the test  we had reviewed previous versions in the case of deficiencies  This year  we were totally at the mercy of the test writers in Princeton  NJ  Area by area  the department has target  percentile  scores as part of our AACSB assessment program  When a particular score goes below the minimum  the instructor s  in that area is are required to conduct a review of the test questions on which cadets scored the lowest  It may be that a test question topic is not taught or emphasized  Each instructor is given the discretion to include or exclude course topics based on their professional judgment  However  we believe the department s historic scores on the MFTB are an accurate indicator of the overall high quality of the program  Indeed  the scores for 2010 11 were achieved knowing only the broadest parameters of what would be tested    Spring 2011 Newsletter  Field Test  Faculty
