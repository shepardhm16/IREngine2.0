cellular structure and their molecular basis of inheritance  they are diverse in many other aspects  The diversity of life leads to many divisions in biological science involved with studying all aspects of living organisms  The primary divisions of study in biology consist of zoology  animals  botany  plants  and protistology  one celled organisms  and are aimed at examining such topics as origins  structure  function  reproduction  growth and development  behavior  and evolution of the different organisms  In addition  biologists consider how living organisms interact with each other
