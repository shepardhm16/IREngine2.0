recent and still ongoing revision of the French curriculum at VMI has as its goal not only producing more French majors  but exposing all cadets who study the language to the rich linguistic and cultural heritage of France and French speaking nations  Maj  Abbey Carrico and Maj  Jeff Kendrick  both assistant professors of modern languages and cultures  were hired last year with the goal of revitalizing VMI s French curriculum  The move came at the same time that the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures was undergoing a restructuring  with German and Japanese being dropped from the linguistic lineup and Mandarin Chinese added  For Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett  chair of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  it was critical that VMI retain instruction in French  despite the fact that some other colleges and universities are cutting classes in that language   The military needs people who speak French  Bulger Barnett commented   If we do away with French  there goes a strategic language for Europe and North Africa  We have to have French  Carrico echoed this  saying   Every continent has French  It s very global and very widespread  Carrico noted that most of the course changes came not at the 100 to 200 level  as those introductory courses are similar at most colleges and universities  but at the 300 level  where the focus makes a final turn from learning the basics to reading and writing in the language  It s not as if the shift to reading and writing in French occurs dramatically overnight   Cadets have  already been writing at the 200 level  said Carrico   We ve had them writing at the 100 level  It s just expanding it and building on vocabulary and analytical skills  Among the new courses designed to help cadets make the transition to a deeper appreciation of French literature and culture is one centered on water and literature  L eau  R flexions du pr sent dans le pass  which Carrico is teaching this semester  This past spring  Kendrick taught a course titled France s Gourmet Culture  The course filled to capacity immediately  These culturally oriented courses  which typically include readings from a variety of texts  have replaced genre based courses such as those focusing on poetry or the novel  In redesigning the curriculum  Carrico and Kendrick are striving to meet the needs not only of French majors  but also of history and international studies majors  all of whom are required to take a foreign language through the 300 level   We wanted to nourish them in their development linguistically and culturally  said Carrico  Nor have Carrico and Kendrick limited their efforts to the classroom  This summer  the two professors joined forces with the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies to take 13 cadets to Paris for studies in art history and French literature  Next year  they hope to begin a five week summer language program in Paris run by VMI  Much closer to home  Carrico and Kendrick lead a French table in Crozet Hall each Wednesday at lunch time  with the gathering open to anyone who speaks French   That s been a great way to meet students outside the classroom  Carrico noted  The department also sponsors Spanish  Arabic  German  and Chinese tables  Through conversations inside and outside the classroom  both Carrico and Kendrick spend much time interacting with their students   first as a way of strengthening French conversational skills and promoting fluency and second as a means of learning about each cadet s goals and intended career path   All of our courses are very interactive and require a lot of participation on the students  part  said Carrico   We really get to know them very well  She continued   There s a lot in this field that s very approachable for students and very applicable to their lives  I don t think people always know that about language studies  By  Mary Price IR   Oct  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI
