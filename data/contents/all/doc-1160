  Hiden Stonewall Jackson at VMI James C  Hiden Reminiscences Stonewall Jackson at VMI top level James C  Hiden was a member of the Virginia Military Class of 1857  This account first appeared in the Montgomery  Alabama Advertiser  November 27  1892  and was also published in the Southern Historical Society Papers  Vol  20  1892  p  307  It was later published in the VMI Cadetnewspaper on March 17  1910   Stonewall Jackson  Reminiscences of Him as a Professor in the Virginia Military Institute  Some of His Peculiarities Shown   But Jackson s life  as a teacher  was singularly monotonous  He seldom opened his mouth except from absolute necessity  As Dick Taylor said  If silence is golden  Jackson was a bonanza  He had his text books  and he prescribed the lessons fearfully long and desperately hard lessons they were and at the appointed time he  heard  them  and this was about all of it  Discussions in the class room were unknown  and even explanations were infrequent  and when they did occur they usually left the matter where they found it  The text was the one great thing which he came to  hear  and we came to  say  if we could  and most of us commonly couldn t  when the said text was Bartlett s Course of Natural Philosophy  in three of the toughest volumes that this scribe ever attacked Mechanics   Optics and Acoustics  and  Spherical Astronomy   When I went in the  Third Class  I used to see Allen tugging over  Old Jack s  terrible lessons in Bartlett s Optics  and one day I opened the book and found on the fly leaf the following stanza  which I suspect was Allen s own  Tis said that Optics treats of light  But oh  believe it not  my lark  I ve studied it with all my might And still it s left me in the dark  Major Jackson was perfectly at home in the long  intricate and multitudinous  equations  and other mathematical formulas which make up so large a part of Bartlett s three volumes  and many of the cadets often expressed the belief that none of these ponderous tomes contained an equation or a formula which  Old Jack  could not repeat  by heart  And yet  with all his minute and accurate acquaintance with the course  there was very little teaching done in that department  unless teaching be understood to mean the prescribing and hearing of lessons  Teaching  in the modern sense of that term  was not Jackson s forte  His silence was phenomenal  and sometimes portentous  He had no turn for explanation  no talent for putting things in various points of view  so as to adapt them to the various mental conditions of his pupils  During the war he was often and highly commended for keeping his plans to himself  but I doubt if he could have explained those plans if he had done his best Though I drilled under him for three years  and recited to him daily for a year and a half  I never saw him laugh outright  A very quiet  subdued sort of smile was the nearest thing to laughter that I ever saw him indulge in  and those smiles were very infrequent  and  indeed  occurred only when outrageously ludicrous things took place in his immediate presence  If Davidson Penn  a portent of mischief  put on an uncommonly serious face and asked  apparently in good faith   Major  can a cannon be so bent as to make it shoot around a corner  the Professor of Artillery would show not the slightest sign of merriment or impatience  but would  after a moment of sober reflection  reply   Mr  Penn  I reckon hardly  We could never decide whether his gravity on such an occasion was real or assumed  but  if it was assumed  it was certainly well acted  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination Statement   Privacy   THE
