Va  Aug  23  2014   Tom Petty  he of the Heartbreakers and  Freefallin  fame  once said   The waiting is the hardest part  He didn t have the incoming rats in VMI s Class of 2018 in mind when he penned those lyrics  but the 500 soon to be cadets sure could relate  Matriculation Day 2014 was  as always  a case of  hurry up and wait   It was a little nerve racking  said Kyle Leonard  15 as he helped guide the new recruits around Cameron Hall and reminisced about his Matriculation and the long wait he endured   To be honest  it was kind of a blur  Before they call you down  there is a bit of anticipation  Matriculation by the Numbers Total  500 In State  295 Out of State  205 Males  427 Females      73 STEM Major  59  Liberal Arts Majors  41  States Represented      37 Foreign Countries      7   When the new cadets  numbers were called and they finally got to leave their seats high above the Cameron Hall floor  seats that grew harder and magically smaller as the minutes crept by  they were paraded by a series of tables  They took care of all the registration business and any last minute financial problems that arose  they strolled by a wide array of stations occupied by various academic departments  While the lines moved pretty quickly considering how many incoming cadets were passing through Cameron Hall  they were held up now and again by proud parents who needed to document the proceedings  The click whirr of cameras could be heard over the din  and more than one family  often decked out in their newly purchased VMI gear  stopped their new rat at every table to snap a picture  Leonard remembers that part well   My dad is an  alumnus  he said   He was proud  but anxious for me because he knew what was coming  My mom was nervous  sad that I was leaving home  Leonard s father  Scott Leonard  was a member of the Class of 1989  Separation anxiety had not set in at that point  That came just after signing the Matriculation Book  a long standing tradition at VMI that has always been part of the first day experience  Once that name is recorded  the new cadets march up the stairs  where they are issued uniforms for physical training and briefly part ways with their families  For many of them  the thought that they are genuine VMI rats  about to meet cadre for the first time  began to become reality  And after the superintendent gave his welcoming speech and the group marched to barracks as the newest rat mass  it all struck home   It really sinks in during march up  Leonard recalled   It gives you goose bumps  It was impressive  very surreal  And for some of them  that sense of nervousness  the anxiety of leaving family and friends  the uneasy feeling of leaving the real world behind begins to fade away   I was nervous right up to march up  Leonard said  remember his matriculation in 2011   That was when it hit  and I knew I should be here  For the VMI class of 2018  the wait is over    Chris Floyd    VMI    VMI Foundation
