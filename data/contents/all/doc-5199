VMI Superintendent Francis H  Smith to Virginia Governor Henry A  Wise  More about this topic   Va  Mil  Institute  Nov  19th 1859 His Excellency  H  A  Wise Richmond  Dear Sir  The Adjutant General has shown me your communication to him dated Nov  17th with reference to the propriety   expediency of ordering a detachment of the Corps of Cadets to be present at the execution of Brown   the others  When I originally tendered to your excellency the services of the Corps of Cadets for any duty which their military education might qualify them in the emergency now pressing upon the state  it was from the conviction that in all the essential elements of military defense they were better prepared than any other portion of the military of the state  More than this  I believe that the sentiment of any parent would respond to this patriotic duty on behalf of the sons  in giving protection to their own homes   firesides from the wicked assaults of incendiary   midnight marauders  My opinion in the prospect of their services being required now is unchanged  I can readily select 80 able bodied   well disciplined cadets acquainted with the Artillery drill  who will be ready to obey your excellency s order for the duty now claiming their service   I tender you my own services   those of Maj  Gilham   any other officer for duty in connection  Thanking you for this confidence that  is  placed in the this Institution  Va  Mil  Institute  Nov  22d 1859 His excellency  Henry A  Wise Charles Town  Va  Dear Sir  In obedience to the instructions conveyed to me by your telegraphic dispatch  I have kept a detachment of the Corps of Cadets  80 in number  with a battery of Howitzers  ready for service at a moments call  and I beg leave to state that the command is provided with all the appliances for taking care of themselves upon the field of duty now claiming their services  The Commissary has his cooks   cooking implements in order   we are thus in a state of preparation much more complete than that attends an ordinary militia command  In addition it gives me pleasure to state that Messrs  Harman   Co  have placed their stages   entire stock at Lexington   Staunton at my command   they will transport my detachment at a moment s call  free of charge  I mention it specially to you  as showing the patriotic spirit that actuates them  These facilities will enable me to reach Winchester in 20 hours after notice   you may therefore rely upon dispatch in our movements as soon as ordered  I am at your service for duty in advance of the Corps  should it be required  VMI

upon the state  it was from the conviction that in all the essential elements of military defense they were better prepared than any other portion of the military of the state  More than this  I
