Controls on the Development of Sinkholes in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for groundwater recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  A preliminary analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented  Speaker Bio Matt Heller has more than 20 years of professional experience in geologic mapping  hydrogeology  mineral exploration  natural hazards  and geoscience education  He currently manages geologic and hazard mapping programs for the Virginia

Karst Program  Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  The Importance of Long Term Monitoring for Understanding the Dynamics of Karst Hydrological Processes  Two Case Studies From Virginia The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  DCR  Natural Heritage Program monitors specific karst hydrological systems at several locations around the state  Some projects are for the study of habitat for cave adapted organisms  while others are more generally aimed at understanding and describing karst processes  Two ongoing studies have accumulated long term  high resolution time series data sets containing data on temperature and electrical conductivity of karst waters over time  as well as water levels either measured directly or reflected by drip rates and stream flow  Analyzed against broader climatic data  these data sets reveal responses of karst systems that are both very systematic and that differ significantly from our preconceptions when the projects began  A study of phreatic waters in the Shenandoah Valley suggests a high degree of compartmentalization of the karst system  with adjacent  aquifers  only connecting for short periods of time during very high water level  A second study  of epikarstic discharge via drip waters to a cave in the New River Valley  shows the importance of the epikarst in the detention and release of meteoric waters and the critical role that timing of precipitation plays in aquifer recharge  The results of these studies have broader implications for storm water management  drought prediction  and contaminant transport  Speaker Bio Wil Orndorff is a proud native of the Shenandoah Valley  and grew up drinking karst groundwater from the well on his family s farm  Wil has spent the last 16 years studying and protecting caves and karst with the Virginia Natural Heritage Program  in the Department of Conservation and Recreation  He has been exploring caves for nearly 30 years  and is a director at large of the Virginia Speleological Survey  manager of the New River Cave Preserve  training officer with the Blacksburg Cave Rescue Group  and a Fellow of the National Speleological Society  Over the years  Wil has obtained a breadth of knowledge in karst issues  including karst hydrology  biology of subterranean organisms  use of caves by bats  and conservation planning  Wil has published numerous abstracts and several peer reviewed papers on these topics  He holds a Masters Degree in Geology from Virginia Tech  where his wife works as a research faculty member in soils and where his two daughters are presently pursuing undergraduate degrees  Characterizing Karst Aquifers The complex nature of the various types of recharge to the aquifer and the interchange between surface and ground water makes karst aquifers interesting systems to characterize  Most of the flow in karst aquifers is through conduits  but most of the storage is in fractures  The movement of water through the conduit part of the aquifer is best studied using water tracing tests to establish the connections between sinks and springs and to estimate the travel times  flow velocity  Speaker Bio Mr  Jones is a consulting hydrologist with Environmental Data in Warm Springs  Virginia  He studies physical hydrology of surface and ground water resources with an emphasis on areas underlain by carbonate  karst  aquifers  He has studied karst areas across North America  France  Eastern Europe  China and Southeast Asia  Mr  Jones is the author of more than 30 papers on karst hydrology and water tracing  He is the author of the Karst Hydrology Atlas of West Virginia  1997  and served as the guest editor for a special issue of the National Speleological Society Bulletin on water tracing using fluorescent tracers  1984  He wrote chapters on karst and water tracing for the Encyclopedia of Caves  He is a consultant to the US Army Environmental Center on the remediation of hazardous wastes in karst aquifers on military bases  He also studies ground water movement in fractured aquifers and statistical characterization of water resources  Current research projects include the problems of instrumenting small catchments to measure precipitation and flows for water balance studies  Mr  Jones holds a BSF degree in Forest Management from West Virginia University  1973  and an MS degree in Environmental Science  Hydrology  from the University of Virginia  1989  He was an adjunct professor of hydrology at the American University  Washington  DC and is on the board of directors of the Karst Waters Institute  Leesburg  Virginia  William K  Jones  Hydrologist  Environmental Data Karst  Fitting Regulatory Square Pegs Into Round Holes This presentation describes the regulatory dilemma surrounding karst regulation and analyzes various regulatory approaches to karst  In addition  the speaker considers a variety of non regulatory approaches that  in conjunction with regulatory approaches  may more effectively protect public health  The presenter concludes that education of regulators  government officials  and citizens must precede any regulatory or non regulatory measures if those measures are to effectively protect public health and karst resources  Regulation of karst to protect groundwater and public health poses unique challenges to regulators  First and foremost  often no regulatory authority is assigned responsibility for karst  For example  in the United States the federal government lacks authority to directly regulate karst  State governments hold authority to regulate  but often fail to do so  Therefore  regulation of karst in the United States mostly falls to local governments  which often lack the resources and expertise to effectively regulate karst  In addition  the regulation is required  often constitutionally  to apply uniformly to the regulated community to avoid claims of arbitrary and discriminatory treatment  Uniform regulation has been crafted in most settings  However  the karst environment is chaotic and each situation presents unique circumstances that call for variable approaches  In this context  standard regulatory approaches often fail to protect public health and creative approaches often face legal challenge  Speaker Bio JESSE J  RICHARDSON  JR is an Associate Professor and the Lead Land Use Attorney at the Land Use and Sustainable Development Law Clinic at the West Virginia University College of Law  Before coming to WVU  Richardson was an Associate Professor at Virginia Tech  His research and experience focuses on land use law and water law  Jesse began his legal career in private practice in his hometown of Winchester  Virginia  first with a large law firm  then as a solo practitioner  He presently serves on the Board of Directors of the American Agricultural Law Association and is the President Elect  He also serves on the Board of Directors for the National Cave and Karst Research Institute  He previously served on the Virginia Cave Board and the Boards of Directors of the Universities Council on Water Resources  Virginia Farmland Protection Task Force  and the Virginia Water Policy Technical Advisory Committee  Jesse was honored with the 1999 Professional Scholarship Award from the American Agricultural Law Association  the 2004 William E  Wine Award for a history of teaching Excellence from Virginia Tech  the highest teaching award granted by the university  and the 2009 University Certificate of Excellence in Outreach  He holds a B S  and M S  in

Sustainable Development Law Clinic  Successful Use of Resistivity Imaging for Karst Investigations in Engineering Applications  Recent Case Studies in the Appalachian Region Resistivity imaging is a very powerful geophysical tool for successfully characterizing subsurface karst formation  It can be invaluable during the design and planning phase  prior to site development  so that potential karst conditions or hazards can be identified  avoided  or engineered accordingly  Resistivity imaging is also the best tool for characterizing the subsurface after karst hazards have been encountered  such as sinkhole collapses  This talk presents three recent case studies where resistivity imaging successfully characterized the nature of karst formation beneath a site  both before site development and after damage from sinkhole subsidence or collapses occurred  In each case  the results of the resistivity investigation were critical to the successful engineering or remediation efforts of the project site  Speaker Bio Chris Printz received a Bachelors degree in Geology and Environmental Science from James Madison University in 2001  after which he worked in the environmental consulting field for one year before joining ATS International in the fall of 2002  He has been involved since the mid 1990s in cave and karst studies in the Appalachian region  including cave mapping and new exploration  dye tracing studies  and geophysical investigations  With ATS  he has used a number of geophysical methods for subsurface imaging and characterization  but electrical resistivity imaging is by far the most useful for karst investigations  Since 2002  he has conducted many dozens of karst related resistivity studies for karst characterization beneath project sites  Chris M  Printz  P G

Applications  Recent Case Studies in the Appalachian Region Resistivity imaging is a very powerful geophysical tool for successfully characterizing subsurface karst formation  It can be invaluable during the design and planning phase  prior to site development  so that potential karst conditions or hazards can be identified  avoided  or engineered accordingly  Resistivity imaging is also the best tool for characterizing the subsurface after karst hazards have been encountered  such as sinkhole collapses  This talk presents three recent case studies where resistivity imaging successfully characterized the nature of karst formation beneath a site  both before site development and after damage from sinkhole subsidence or collapses occurred  In each case  the results of the resistivity investigation were critical to the successful engineering or remediation efforts of the project site  Speaker Bio Chris Printz received a Bachelors degree in Geology and Environmental Science from

analysis of karst geohazards  He is currently employed by the Virginia Department of Transportation as the Engineering Geologist for the Staunton District  comprising the northern Valley and Ridge of Virginia  Brian Bruckno  B A  M S  Ph D  P G  Rock Slope Stability  Geohazards  Engineering Geology  and Remote Sensing Geologic Controls on the Development of Sinkholes in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for groundwater recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  A preliminary analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented  Speaker Bio Matt Heller has more than 20 years of professional experience in geologic mapping  hydrogeology  mineral exploration

Long Term Monitoring for Understanding the Dynamics of Karst Hydrological Processes  Two Case Studies From Virginia The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  DCR  Natural Heritage Program monitors specific karst hydrological systems at several locations around the state  Some projects are for the study of habitat for cave adapted organisms  while others are more generally aimed at understanding and describing karst processes  Two ongoing studies have accumulated long term  high resolution time series data sets containing data on temperature and electrical conductivity of karst waters over time  as well as water levels either measured directly or reflected by drip rates and stream flow  Analyzed against broader climatic data  these data sets reveal responses of karst systems that are both very systematic and that differ significantly from our preconceptions when the projects began  A study of phreatic waters in the Shenandoah Valley suggests a high degree of compartmentalization of the karst system  with adjacent  aquifers  only connecting for short periods of time during very high water level  A second study  of epikarstic discharge via drip waters to a cave in the New River Valley  shows the importance of the epikarst in the detention and release of meteoric waters and the critical role that timing of precipitation plays in aquifer recharge  The results of these studies have broader implications for storm water management  drought prediction  and contaminant transport  Speaker Bio Wil Orndorff is a proud native of the Shenandoah Valley  and

Sessions   Speaker Info Addressing Environmental Effects and Karst Hazards  An all day workshop the day before the 2016 Environment Virginia Symposium  Tuesday  April 5  2016  VMI  The Virginia Cave Board and Department of Conservation and Recreation are hosting Building on Karst II  a follow up to last year s well attended pre symposium workshop  This year s workshop continues to explore interactions between the land development process and karst systems  with emphasis on avoiding damage by one on the other  Specific topics this year include state agency responses to karst hazards  the implications of karst hydrology case studies for storm water management and contaminant transport  and karst associated resources from the Virginia Division of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  Participants will include members of the consulting community  local governments  state agencies  and citizen stakeholders  Please join us to learn more about building on karst  an issue receiving increasing attention as land development continues in western Virginia  particularly along the I 81 corridor    Pre conference workshops can be added as an option to your Environment Virginia Symposium registration or as an ONLY registration  HERE Transportation Design and Management Within Karst Terranes of Virginia Dr  Bruckno will discuss how the Virginia Department of Transportation addresses karst conditions in transportation planning  including the role of preliminary mapping of karst hazards  engineering for deep or unsuitable soils common to karst areas  spring damage mitigation  drainage design and storm water management  remediation of karst hazards  particularly sinkholes and the economics of remediation versus best management practices  and protection of sensitive karst habitats  Speaker Bio Dr  Bruckno received a B A  in Geology from Rutgers College in 1993  and an M S  and Ph D  in Geology from the University of Nebraska in 1997 and 2010  respectively  His doctoral work focused on rock slope stability and rock mechanics  His current research focus is on remote sensing technologies for applications to geotechnical design and management of geohazards  with specific attention to LiDAR  InSAR  unmanned aerial vehicles  and photogrammetry in rock slope stability analysis  evaluation of rock mechanics  and early identification and analysis of karst geohazards  He is currently employed by the Virginia Department of Transportation as the Engineering Geologist for the Staunton District  comprising the northern Valley and Ridge of Virginia  Brian Bruckno  B A  M S  Ph D  P G  Rock Slope Stability  Geohazards  Engineering Geology  and Remote Sensing Geologic Controls on the Development of Sinkholes in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for groundwater recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  A preliminary analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented  Speaker Bio Matt Heller has more than 20 years of professional experience in geologic mapping  hydrogeology  mineral exploration  natural hazards  and geoscience education  He currently manages geologic and hazard mapping programs for the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  Matt is a 1998 graduate of the Natural Resources Leadership Institute  a 2004 graduate of the Virginia Commonwealth Management Institute  a 2011 graduate of the Virginia Master Naturalist program  and a Certified Professional Geologist  He is a part time lecturer with the Department of Geology and Environmental Science at James Madison University  DCR Karst Program  Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  The Importance of Long Term Monitoring for Understanding the Dynamics of Karst Hydrological Processes  Two Case Studies From Virginia The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  DCR  Natural Heritage Program monitors specific karst hydrological systems at several locations around the state  Some projects are for the study of habitat for cave adapted organisms  while others are more generally aimed at understanding and describing karst processes  Two ongoing studies have accumulated long term  high resolution time series data sets containing data on temperature and electrical conductivity of karst waters over time  as well as water levels either measured directly or reflected by drip rates and stream flow  Analyzed against broader climatic data  these data sets reveal responses of karst systems that are both very systematic and that differ significantly from our preconceptions when the projects began  A study of phreatic waters in the Shenandoah Valley suggests a high degree of compartmentalization of the karst system  with adjacent  aquifers  only connecting for short periods of time during very high water level  A second study  of epikarstic discharge via drip waters to a cave in the New River Valley  shows the importance of the epikarst in the detention and release of meteoric waters and the critical role that timing of precipitation plays in aquifer recharge  The results of these studies have broader implications for storm water management  drought prediction  and contaminant transport  Speaker Bio Wil Orndorff is a proud native of the Shenandoah Valley  and grew up drinking karst groundwater from the well on his family s farm  Wil has spent the last 16 years studying and protecting caves and karst with the Virginia Natural Heritage Program  in the Department of Conservation and Recreation  He has been exploring caves for nearly 30 years  and is a director at large of the Virginia Speleological Survey  manager of the New River Cave Preserve  training officer with the Blacksburg Cave Rescue Group  and a Fellow of the National Speleological Society  Over the years  Wil has obtained a breadth of knowledge in karst issues  including karst hydrology  biology of subterranean organisms  use of caves by bats  and conservation planning  Wil has published numerous abstracts and several peer reviewed papers on these topics  He holds a Masters Degree in Geology from Virginia Tech  where his wife works as a research faculty member in soils and where his two daughters are presently pursuing undergraduate degrees  Characterizing Karst Aquifers The complex nature of the various types of recharge to the aquifer and the interchange between surface and ground water makes karst aquifers interesting systems to characterize  Most of the flow in karst aquifers is through conduits  but most of the storage is in fractures  The movement of water through the conduit part of the aquifer is best studied using water tracing tests to establish the connections between sinks and springs and to estimate the travel times  flow velocity  Speaker Bio Mr  Jones is a consulting hydrologist with Environmental Data in Warm Springs  Virginia  He studies physical hydrology of surface and ground water resources with an emphasis on areas underlain by carbonate  karst  aquifers  He has studied karst areas across North America  France  Eastern Europe  China and Southeast Asia  Mr  Jones is the author of more than 30 papers on karst hydrology and water tracing  He is the author of the Karst Hydrology Atlas of West Virginia  1997  and served as the guest editor for a special issue of the National Speleological Society Bulletin on water tracing using fluorescent tracers  1984  He wrote chapters on karst and water tracing for the Encyclopedia of Caves  He is a consultant to the US Army Environmental Center on the remediation of hazardous wastes in karst aquifers on military bases  He also studies ground water movement in fractured aquifers and statistical characterization of water resources  Current research projects include the problems of instrumenting small catchments to measure precipitation and flows for water balance studies  Mr  Jones holds a BSF degree in Forest Management from West Virginia University  1973  and an MS degree in Environmental Science  Hydrology  from the University of Virginia  1989  He was an adjunct professor of hydrology at the American University  Washington  DC and is on the board of directors of the Karst Waters Institute  Leesburg  Virginia  William K  Jones  Hydrologist  Environmental Data Karst  Fitting Regulatory Square Pegs Into Round Holes This presentation describes the regulatory dilemma surrounding karst regulation and analyzes various regulatory approaches to karst  In addition  the speaker considers a variety of non regulatory approaches that  in conjunction with regulatory approaches  may more effectively protect public health  The presenter concludes that education of regulators  government officials  and citizens must precede any regulatory or non regulatory measures if those measures are to effectively protect public health and karst resources  Regulation of karst to protect groundwater and public health poses unique challenges to regulators  First and foremost  often no regulatory authority is assigned responsibility for karst  For example  in the United States the federal government lacks authority to directly regulate karst  State governments hold authority to regulate  but often fail to do so  Therefore  regulation of karst in the United States mostly falls to local governments  which often lack the resources and expertise to effectively regulate karst  In addition  the regulation is required  often constitutionally  to apply uniformly to the regulated community to avoid claims of arbitrary and discriminatory treatment  Uniform regulation has been crafted in most settings  However  the karst environment is chaotic and each situation presents unique circumstances that call for variable approaches  In this context  standard regulatory approaches often fail to protect public health and creative approaches often face legal challenge  Speaker Bio JESSE J  RICHARDSON  JR is an Associate Professor and the Lead Land Use Attorney at the Land Use and Sustainable Development Law Clinic at the West Virginia University College of Law  Before coming to WVU  Richardson was an Associate Professor at Virginia Tech  His research and experience focuses on land use law and water law  Jesse began his legal career in private practice in his hometown of Winchester  Virginia  first with a large law firm  then as a solo practitioner  He presently serves on the Board of Directors of the American Agricultural Law Association and is the President Elect  He also serves on the Board of Directors for the National Cave and Karst Research Institute  He previously served on the Virginia Cave Board and the Boards of Directors of the Universities Council on Water Resources  Virginia Farmland Protection Task Force  and the Virginia Water Policy Technical Advisory Committee  Jesse was honored with the 1999 Professional Scholarship Award from the American Agricultural Law Association  the 2004 William E  Wine Award for a history of teaching Excellence from Virginia Tech  the highest teaching award granted by the university  and the 2009 University Certificate of Excellence in Outreach  He holds a B S  and M S  in Agricultural and Applied Economics from Virginia Tech and a J D  from the University of Virginia School of Law  Jesse J  Richardson  Jr  Associate Professor Lead Land Use Attorney Land Use and Sustainable Development Law Clinic  Successful Use of Resistivity Imaging for Karst Investigations in Engineering Applications  Recent Case Studies in the Appalachian Region Resistivity imaging is a very powerful geophysical tool for successfully characterizing subsurface karst formation  It can be invaluable during the design and planning phase  prior to site development  so that potential karst conditions or hazards can be identified  avoided  or engineered accordingly  Resistivity imaging is also the best tool for characterizing the subsurface after karst hazards have been encountered  such as sinkhole collapses  This talk presents three recent case studies where resistivity imaging successfully characterized the nature of karst formation beneath a site  both before site development and after damage from sinkhole subsidence or collapses occurred  In each case  the results of the resistivity investigation were critical to the successful engineering or remediation efforts of the project site  Speaker Bio Chris Printz received a Bachelors degree in Geology and Environmental Science from James Madison University in 2001  after which he worked in the environmental consulting field for one year before joining ATS International in the fall of 2002  He has been involved since the mid 1990s in cave and karst studies in the Appalachian region  including cave mapping and new exploration  dye tracing studies  and geophysical investigations  With ATS  he has used a number of geophysical methods for subsurface imaging and characterization  but electrical resistivity imaging is by far the most useful for karst investigations  Since 2002  he has conducted many dozens of karst related resistivity studies for karst characterization beneath project sites  Chris M  Printz  P G   Senior Project Geologist   ATS International  Inc Center for Leadership and Ethics

respectively  His doctoral work focused on rock slope stability and rock mechanics  His current research focus is on remote sensing technologies for applications to geotechnical design and management of geohazards  with specific attention to LiDAR  InSAR  unmanned aerial vehicles  and photogrammetry in rock slope stability analysis  evaluation of rock mechanics  and early identification and analysis of karst geohazards  He is currently employed by the Virginia Department of Transportation as the Engineering Geologist for the Staunton District  comprising the northern Valley and Ridge of Virginia  Brian Bruckno  B A  M S  Ph D  P G  Rock Slope Stability  Geohazards  Engineering Geology  and Remote Sensing Geologic Controls on the Development of Sinkholes in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia Sinkholes are a natural part of many karst landscapes in western Virginia  and can develop in any area that is underlain by carbonate bedrock  The abundance of sinkholes varies greatly depending upon geologic factors  Understanding these factors is important because sinkholes are primary pathways for groundwater recharge into karst aquifers  Geologic mapping in the Interstate 81 Corridor by the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  supported by the National Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program  has allowed for the observation of sinkholes within the context of bedrock type  bedding orientation and thickness  and position relative to fault traces  fold axial traces  and unconsolidated alluvial and colluvial deposits  Field observations suggest that all of these factors influence the development of sinkholes  The recent availability of digital orthophotography and LiDAR has improved our ability to identify and map sinkholes  Overlaying identified sinkholes onto geologic maps in a geographic information system allows for a more rigorous testing of observed relationships  A preliminary analysis for four quadrangles in the Interstate 81 Corridor is ongoing  and preliminary results will be presented  Speaker Bio Matt Heller has more than 20 years of professional experience in geologic mapping  hydrogeology  mineral exploration  natural hazards  and geoscience education  He currently manages geologic and hazard mapping programs for the Virginia Department of Mines  Minerals  and Energy  Matt is a 1998 graduate of the Natural Resources Leadership Institute  a 2004 graduate of the Virginia Commonwealth Management Institute  a 2011 graduate of the Virginia Master Naturalist program  and a Certified Professional Geologist  He is a part time lecturer with the Department of Geology and Environmental Science at James Madison University  DCR Karst Program  Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  The Importance of Long Term Monitoring for Understanding the Dynamics of Karst Hydrological Processes  Two Case Studies From Virginia The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation  DCR  Natural Heritage Program monitors specific karst hydrological systems at several locations around the state  Some projects are for the study of habitat for cave adapted organisms  while others are more generally aimed at understanding and describing karst processes  Two ongoing studies have accumulated long term  high resolution time series data sets containing data on temperature and electrical conductivity of karst waters over time  as well as water levels either measured directly or reflected by drip rates and stream flow  Analyzed against broader climatic data  these data sets reveal responses of karst systems that are both very systematic and that differ significantly from our preconceptions when the projects began  A study of phreatic waters in the Shenandoah Valley suggests a high degree of compartmentalization of the karst system  with adjacent  aquifers  only connecting for short periods of time during very high water level  A second study  of epikarstic discharge via drip waters to a cave in the New River Valley  shows the importance of the epikarst in the detention and release of meteoric waters and the critical role that timing of precipitation plays in aquifer recharge  The results of these studies have broader implications for storm water management  drought prediction  and contaminant transport  Speaker Bio Wil Orndorff is a proud native of the Shenandoah Valley  and grew up drinking karst groundwater from the well on his family s farm  Wil has spent the last 16 years studying and protecting caves and karst with the Virginia Natural Heritage Program  in the Department of Conservation and Recreation  He has been exploring caves for nearly 30 years  and is a director at large of the Virginia Speleological Survey  manager of the New River Cave Preserve  training officer with the Blacksburg Cave Rescue Group  and a Fellow of the National Speleological Society  Over the years  Wil has obtained a breadth of knowledge in karst issues  including karst hydrology  biology of subterranean organisms  use of caves by bats  and conservation planning  Wil has published numerous abstracts and several peer reviewed papers on these topics  He holds a Masters Degree in Geology from Virginia Tech  where his wife works as a research faculty member in soils and where his two daughters are presently pursuing undergraduate degrees  Characterizing Karst Aquifers The complex nature of the various types of recharge to the aquifer and the interchange between surface and ground water makes karst aquifers interesting systems to characterize  Most of the flow in karst aquifers is through conduits  but most of the storage is in fractures  The movement of water through the conduit part of the aquifer is best studied using water tracing tests to establish the connections between sinks and springs and to estimate the travel times  flow velocity  Speaker Bio Mr  Jones is a consulting hydrologist with Environmental Data in Warm Springs  Virginia  He studies physical hydrology of surface and ground water resources with an emphasis on areas underlain by carbonate  karst  aquifers  He has studied karst areas across North America  France  Eastern Europe  China and Southeast Asia  Mr  Jones is the author of more than 30 papers on karst hydrology and water tracing  He is the author of the Karst Hydrology Atlas of West Virginia  1997  and served as the guest editor for a special issue of the National Speleological Society Bulletin on water tracing using fluorescent tracers  1984  He wrote chapters on karst and water tracing for the Encyclopedia of Caves  He is a consultant to the US Army Environmental Center on the remediation of hazardous wastes in karst aquifers on military bases  He also studies ground water movement in fractured aquifers and statistical characterization of water resources  Current research projects include the problems of instrumenting small catchments to measure precipitation and flows for water balance studies  Mr  Jones holds a BSF degree in Forest Management from West Virginia University  1973  and an MS degree in Environmental Science  Hydrology  from the University of Virginia  1989  He was an adjunct professor of hydrology at the American University  Washington  DC and is on the board of directors of the Karst Waters Institute  Leesburg  Virginia  William K  Jones  Hydrologist  Environmental Data Karst  Fitting Regulatory Square Pegs Into Round Holes This presentation describes the regulatory dilemma surrounding karst regulation and analyzes various regulatory approaches to karst  In addition  the speaker considers a variety of non regulatory approaches that  in conjunction with regulatory approaches  may more effectively protect public health  The presenter concludes that education of regulators  government officials  and citizens must precede any regulatory or non regulatory measures if those measures are to effectively protect public health and karst resources  Regulation of karst to protect groundwater and public health poses unique challenges to regulators  First and foremost  often no regulatory authority is assigned responsibility for karst  For example  in the United States the federal government lacks authority to directly regulate karst  State governments hold authority to regulate  but often fail to do so  Therefore  regulation of karst in the United States mostly falls to local governments  which often lack the resources and expertise to effectively regulate karst  In addition  the regulation is required  often constitutionally  to apply uniformly to the regulated community to avoid claims of arbitrary and discriminatory treatment  Uniform regulation has been crafted in most settings  However  the karst environment is chaotic and each situation presents unique circumstances that call for variable approaches  In this context  standard regulatory approaches often fail to protect public health and creative approaches often face legal challenge

Applications  Recent Case Studies in the Appalachian Region Resistivity imaging is a very powerful geophysical tool for successfully characterizing subsurface karst formation  It can be invaluable during the design and planning phase  prior to site development  so that potential karst conditions or hazards can be identified  avoided  or engineered accordingly  Resistivity imaging is also the best tool for characterizing the subsurface after karst hazards have been encountered  such as sinkhole collapses  This talk presents three recent case studies where resistivity imaging successfully characterized the nature of karst formation beneath a site  both before site development and after damage from sinkhole subsidence or collapses occurred  In each case  the results of the resistivity investigation were critical to the successful engineering or remediation efforts of the project site  Speaker Bio Chris Printz received a Bachelors degree in Geology and Environmental Science from James Madison University in 2001  after which he worked in the environmental consulting field for one year before joining ATS International in the fall of 2002  He has been involved since the mid 1990s in cave and karst studies in the Appalachian region  including cave mapping and new exploration  dye tracing studies  and geophysical investigations  With ATS  he has used a number of geophysical methods for subsurface imaging and characterization  but electrical resistivity imaging is by far the most useful for karst investigations  Since 2002  he has conducted many dozens of karst related resistivity studies for karst characterization beneath project sites  Chris M  Printz  P G   Senior Project Geologist   ATS International  Inc Building on Karst II  Sessions   Speaker
