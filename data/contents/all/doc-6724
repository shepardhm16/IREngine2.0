has been a lot  The biggest of these summer projects thus far was repairing a cattle underpass near the Buena Vista end of the trail  All bridges and overpasses along the trail are monitored for maintenance needs  and this one got top priority because of the nuisance it was causing for both users of the Chessie Trail and landowners along the trek   It was pretty well rotted out  noted Larry Camper  chief of maintenance and operations at the physical plant   It was a safety hazard  Camper noted that neither local cattle  who are supposed to pass under the structure to reach grazing land  nor users of the trail  who pass over the bridge to continue their hikes  were using it  Instead  both groups were walking on the ground around the structure  causing erosion  The task of repairing the underpass fell to housing maintenance team supervisor John Camper and his crew  Joe Fix and Matt Cline  After more than 70 hours of work  they had replaced all of the beams  constructed a much sturdier bridge  and added transitions to both sides  With the new bridge in place  pedestrians will no longer be tempted to detour  cattle have passage to pastures  and the VMI maintenance crew can safely drive its vehicles along the path  Harris and his group have also removed several gates  which will be replaced in the near future  and added 20 new signs  warning hikers about private property boundaries  parking  blocking gates  and a rare endangered plant that was recently discovered growing along the trail   It s a great place  noted John Camper   But unless you have somebody diligently

walkway  This summer is bringing much more work than usual  In addition to cleanup after storms and periodic repairs  the physical plant crew has been charged with a number of larger projects that are part of what is hoped will be continuing improvements on the 7 mile stretch of trail between Lexington and Buena Vista   Normally  it s just upkeep  but what we ve done in the last year is probably  twice  as much as we ve done in the last two or three years  said grounds foreman Jackson  J B  Harris   Here lately it has been a lot  The biggest of these summer projects thus far was repairing a cattle underpass near the Buena Vista end of the trail  All bridges and overpasses along the trail are monitored for maintenance needs  and this one got top priority because of the nuisance it was causing for both users of the Chessie Trail and landowners along the trek   It was pretty well rotted out  noted Larry Camper  chief of maintenance and operations at the physical plant   It was a safety hazard  Camper noted that neither local cattle  who are supposed to pass under the structure to reach grazing land  nor users of the trail  who pass over the bridge to continue their hikes  were using it  Instead  both groups were walking on the ground around the structure  causing erosion  The task of repairing the underpass fell to housing maintenance team supervisor John Camper and his crew  Joe Fix and Matt Cline  After more than 70 hours of work  they had replaced all of the beams  constructed a much sturdier bridge  and added transitions to both sides  With the new bridge in place  pedestrians will no longer be tempted to detour  cattle have passage to pastures  and the VMI maintenance crew can safely drive its vehicles along the path  Harris and his group have also removed several gates  which will be replaced in the near future  and added 20 new signs  warning hikers about private property boundaries  parking  blocking gates  and a rare endangered plant that was recently discovered growing along the trail   It s a great place  noted John Camper   But unless you have somebody diligently checking it out  it can go from great to horrible in one storm
