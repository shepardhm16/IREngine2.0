FAQ Return to Records Management top level Please contact the VMI Archives for assistance with records management  We provide secure  on site bulk shredding services for VMI offices General Records Management What is Records Management    Records management as defined by the Virginia Public Records Act is the      The application of efficient and economical methods for managing the lifecycle of public records consistent with regulations and guidelines promulgated by the State Library Board        Code of Virginia  42 1 85 A  The lifecycle of a record includes its creation  use  storage and final disposition  What are public records     The Virginia Public Records Act  Code of Virginia  42 1 77  defines public records   Public record  or  record  means recorded information that documents a transaction or activity by or with any public officer  agency or employee of an agency  Regardless of physical form or characteristic  the recorded information is a public record if it is produced  collected  received or retained in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business  The medium upon which such information is recorded has no bearing on the determination of whether the recording is a public record  Can anyone see my records    Except as restricted by specific provisions in state or federal law  anyone may consult public records  Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  requests are handled by the Office of the Superintendent  See VMI s FOIA information page for details about rights and responsibilities  What about confidential records    Not all records are open to public inspection  Some records are covered by state or federal laws governing privacy and confidentiality Confidential records should be maintained securely  both electronically and physically secure  and should be destroyed using a secure method once their retention period has expired  What if my office doesn t create records  Every VMI office generates  receives  or uses records  Not all records have long term historical  legal  administrative or fiscal value  but they all must be managed according to the state s Records Retention and Disposition Schedules  approved by the Library of Virginia  See this Records Decision Tree  Most records will be destroyed at the end of a specific retention period  However  some offices create records that will be retained permanently in the VMI Archives  VMI s official policy concerning records management is stated in General Order 21  As a state agency  the Virginia Military Institute must comply with the requirements for records retention and disposition as governed by the provisions of the Virginia Public Records Act Code of Virginia  What does  reference copy  mean    A reference copy is usually a record that your office has for its own use and is not the original or official copy for the Institute  As an example  many academic departments maintain copies of student records  transcripts  etc  however  the official record keeper for these records is the Registrar  Since the academic department needs these records for their own use   or reference use   they are called  reference copies  Reference copies have different retention periods based upon their designation as a reference copy and may not require the completion of an RM3 form requesting approval for destruction  Do you offer training    We provide in person consultation and  training upon request  Please contact COL Diane Jacob to schedule a training session  In addition  the Library of Virginia has issued a number of short  online training videos that cover the most important topics regarding retention and destruction of records  See our training page for further information and links  Requirements for retention of records How long do I have to keep records    Required retention times for state agency records are specified in the Library of Virginia s  Records Retention Schedules   Retention schedules are simply documents that list types of records  called series and the length of time they must be retained  Records are destroyed at the end of their required retention period  or lifecycle  It is the content of a record   not the format   that determines how long it must be retained  Email  pdfs  and other electronic files are no different than paper documents  and must be retained for the same length of time as is required for their paper counterparts see the section below called Email and Electronic Records  Once your records are eligible for disposal  you must follow the procedures for records destruction  What is a retention schedule     Records retention schedules are lists of record series  types of records  held by many or most offices instructing the office how long to keep the records in accordance with the Virginia Public Records Act  These schedules are maintained by the Library of Virginia and are known as General Schedules  They are divided into broad categories including administrative records  college and university records  fiscal records  personnel records  and others  What is a records series    A records series is a group of related records  in any format  held by an organization  A records series usually includes multiple documents or forms that have a relationship and should be retained for a similar length of time For example   Purchasing Records  comprise a records series on the Fiscal Records Retention Schedule  What if I have records not listed on the schedule  The approved retention schedules contain both broad and specific categories and cover all commonly created records  If you cannot locate a records series  type of records  in the Library of Virginia approved Records Retention and Disposition Schedules  please contact the VMI Archives for assistance  We will either direct you to the correct records series  or consult with the state records management office on your behalf  What about audits and legal holds    Offices which are regularly audited should retain their financial records until their annual or regular audit is complete AND then follow the retention instructions in the Library of Virginia approved Records Retention and Disposition Schedules  Offices that are not audited on a regular basis should follow the retention periods in the Library of Virginia approved schedules  Records may not be destroyed until all audits have been completed AND the required retention period has expired  If any office receives notification  via phone  email or other communication method  that certain records need to be retained due to an audit the office should at that point cease any destructions  Records that are subject to a legal hold or litigation hold must not be destroyed until officially released from the hold  A hold is placed when either an official discovery order is served on the Institute requesting the production of certain records  for a litigation  regulatory investigation  audit  open records request  etc  or when litigation is pending and the Institute is on notice to preserve all potentially relevant records  You must ensure that for a claim or litigation that is reasonably foreseeable but has not yet been initiated  any relevant records  in paper or electronic formats  are preserved and not destroyed until officially released from the hold  The records in question must not be destroyed until the completion of the action and the resolution of all issues that arise from it regardless of the retention period set forth in the schedule  What about historically significant and other permanent records    Some offices create records of permanent historical  legal  or administrative value These archival records should be transferred to the VMI Archives for preservation and cataloging after they become  inactive   i e  are no longer needed in your office during the course of business  The Archives staff will review all records transfers to verify their retention status Consult the Archives staff if you believe you have historically significant or other permanent records If in doubt  please consult us Don t place retired permanent records in off site storage  closets etc  as they may be damaged or lost  Note  Some retention schedules refer to transferring records to the Library of Virginia Archives  This is not done at VMI and most other state colleges universities with institutional Archives on site  Such records should be sent to the VMI Archives for preservation  Destruction of Records When can I destroy records    Records may not be destroyed until their required retention period has been met  Consult the applicable Records Retention and Disposition Schedules to determine the retention period required by law  If the retention period has been met or exceeded  you may proceed with completing a certificate of records destruction  If you have questions about retention please contact the VMI Archives  How do I get approval for destroying records once they have met the required retention period     Please follow these instructions  You must complete a Certificate of Records Destruction  RM3  form and have it signed by an administrator in your office and by the Head of Archives and Records Management  Destruction of records must be documented on a properly completed RM3  Where can I find the required certificate of records destruction  RM3  form    The blank certificate of records destruction  along with instructions and examples  is found on our Records Destruction Information page Before filling out the form please review the completed example and view the video linked on the page  Can you help with shredding records    The Archives provides secure  bulk on site shredding through a commercial service  This service is only for records that require confidential destruction and have met the retention requirements and are ready for immediate destruction  Please follow these instructions for transferring the material to the Archives for confidential shredding  We cannot store records in anticipation of a future destruction date  Email and Electronic Records How long should I keep email and other electronic records    Retention requirements are based on the content of the record  not the format Electronic records use the same retention schedules as paper records If a particular electronic document would have been filed as a paper memo  it should still be filed  either in your email program or in your directory structure  and it should be retained the same length of time as its paper counterpart  It is inappropriate to destroy email simply because storage limits have been reached  Review the Records Retention and Disposition Schedules for the records series that applies to the content of the email and follow the retention instructions  Email is most often classified as correspondence which is covered in the Records Retention Schedule GS 101  Do I have to print an email to file it for the specified retention period    Email can be retained in electronic format for the entire length of its retention  however  you must be able to access the email during that entire retention period  Do I have to keep the electronic version of a record and a paper version    You may destroy one format of the records  either paper or electronic  if you retain the other for the retention periods listed in the schedule You must be able to access the electronic record for the entire retention period Records that your office holds in both electronic and paper formats  which are exact duplicates  should both be destroyed once they have met the retention periods in the Records Retention Schedules  Email Management Tips   Email Retention Quick Reference  courtesy University of Virginia Records Management  Evaluate your e mail s  and determine whether they meet the legal definition of a record  If so  retain it in accordance with the type of record  the content of the e mail  as listed in the Library of Virginia Records Retention and Disposition Schedules  FILE IT   Issues policy   states decisions   outlines procedures   shows action   gives guidance   you re not sure TOSS IT   Junk mail   Confirms appointments  Personal messages  Reference copies   Broadcast messages  Transmits documents without comment Records Management and Email  Tips from the Library of Virginia Computer storage is cheap  Shouldn t I just keep all my computer records    Electronic records should not be held beyond their approved retention periods  The best practice is to destroy all records that have met their retention requirements at the same time  regardless of format  Maintaining electronic records beyond their approved retention periods can be used to show lack of compliance with state laws and regulations in a legal or an audit proceeding  We have an imaging system  Do we have to keep the paper    No  however you must be able to access the electronic record for the entire retention period  Also  records with a retention of more than 5 years from creation and records which document financial  contractual or legal actions should be maintained in a  trustworthy  digital system  A  trustworthy  system is one that can prove that the digital copy is an exact duplicate of the original paper throughout its lifecycle  A digital copy  scanned image  can replace the original if held in a  trustworthy  digital system  Paper records with a retention of permanent or with instructions to transfer to the Archives should not be destroyed after imaging before consulting with the VMI Archives Is there a special form for documenting the destruction of electronic records    All records are listed on the same certificate of records destruction form  regardless of format  This example shows both paper and electronic records  Review the Records Retention Schedules and follow the usual instructions for destroying records  Are documents on my computer  records    Yes  the Virginia Public Records Act states  Regardless of physical form or characteristics  the recorded information is a public record if it is produced  collected  received or retained in pursuance of law or in connection with the transaction of public business  The medium upon which such information is recorded has no bearing on the determination of whether the recording is a public record  Records Storage Can I temporarily store material in Archives until it is ready for disposal    We are not able to provide storage for records that will be destroyed at the end of their required retention period  Our space is designed to hold and preserve records that are designated as permanent archival If you do have inactive records that are of permanent historical value  these may be transferred to the Archives  Temporary storage of records is the responsibility of individual offices  Where can we store records we don t need on a daily basis    Each office is responsible for the storage of their records in accordance with the Public Records Act to properly protect and preserve records until their retention period has been met  VMI does not have consolidated records storage at this time  If you have records that are inactive no longer used and they are designated permanent archival  you may send those to the VMI Archives  Records that will ultimately be destroyed must be managed by your department  Can I burn records to a CD or DVD for long term storage    CDs and DVDs are not recommended for long term storage of electronic records  These media are known to deteriorate over time and they should never be viewed as a permanent storage solution  The best location for the storage of electronic records is a secure network server which is backed up daily  How should we store electronic records for long term retention    Best practice is to store records on a secure server which is backed up on a regular basis with the back ups being stored off site  Long term retention of electronic records requires continual maintenance to make sure the media is usable  backed up and readable when needed  Use standard file formats and upgrade to new software versions when new versions become available  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination Statement   Privacy
