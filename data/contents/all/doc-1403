March 22  1866  in Harrison County  Missouri to Kentucky natives  Kerlin had humble beginnings  His father owned several small farms which specialized in the raising and selling of Berkshire hogs and Southdown sheep  The Civil War  however  robbed the Kerlin family of all but their land  Following his father s death in 1874  the eight year old Robert went to work on the family farms  Despite his family s financial woes  the young Kerlin was able to attend school for up to five months each year  In the spring of 1882  at the age of seventeen  Kerlin earned his teaching certificate and began his educational career at the Albany County Public School  In the fall of 1884  at the age of eighteen  he began his pursuit of higher education at Central College in Fayette  Missouri  Over the next several years he completed graduate work in the fields of English  History  and Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University  Harvard  and Yale  where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy in 1906  Kerlin went on to serve as a professor of English at several institutions including Missouri Valley College  Southwestern University  Yale  The State Normal School in Farmville  Virginia  and the Virginia Military Institute  From 1895 until 1898 Dr  Kerlin served as a minister in the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church where he later participated in the compiling of a new church hymnal  He extended his ministry into the armed forces by serving as a chaplain with the Third Missouri Volunteers during the Spanish American War  His time in the military inspired Kerlin to write The Camp Life of the Third Regiment  one of his many internationally renowned books  In the words of London  England s The Spectator   No other work deals so exhaustively and scientifically with the matters of which he wrote  Kerlin s other writings include  The Voice of The Negro  Contemporary Poetry of the Negro  The Church of the Fathers  Theocritus in English Literature  and Mainly for Myself  Kerlin and the VMI Controversy Dr  Kerlin served as a professor and Department Head of English at VMI from 1910 to 1921  In June 1921  his troubles began when his  Open Letter to the Governor of Arkansas  appeared in the  radical  anti segregation publication The Nation  He wrote this letter in response to the news that ninety two African American men had been sentenced to life in prison or execution following the Elaine Riot  The riot was an uprising which ensued after a gathering of African American men  women  and children were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan at their church in Hoop Spur  Arkansas  In the days following the attack  fifty to sixty African Americans were killed while attempting to defend themselves from their attackers  Six of the African Americans arrested were sentenced to death by the governor  In his letter  Kerlin urged Governor Thomas C  McRae to  take the matter into  his  private chamber and give it an hour s consideration  as before the Eternal Judge  By quoting sections of the Bible  the Magna Carta  and the Bill of Rights  Kerlin hoped to dissuade the governor from executing the prisoners on June 10  1921  When the VMI Board of Visitors learned of his letter  Kerlin was dismissed from the faculty of the Institute in 1921  Other charges brought against Dr  Kerlin by the Board included the subsequent  protests of citizens of Arkansas   protests of VMI alumni in Detroit  and Kerlin s  lecturing in Lynchburg  Petersburg  Norfolk  and Richmond to African Americans in African American churches  Even after his harsh treatment  Dr  Kerlin continued to serve as an advocate for racial equality which led to his unpopularity throughout the South  Despite his poor reception at VMI  Dr  Robert T  Kerlin played a major role in the civil rights struggle of Virginia

Kerlin Resources Research by Cadet Fredrick Walker  VMI Class of 2015 Cadet Fredrick Walker s work for the Robert T  Kerlin website was done as part of a Field Work project in the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  Field Work projects allow cadets to apply their classroom learning in a professional or service learning environment and showcase their skills in research  analysis  and communication  About Robert T  Kerlin Dr  Robert Thomas Kerlin served as a professor  minister  soldier  author  and civil rights activist  Born on March 22  1866  in Harrison County  Missouri to Kentucky natives  Kerlin had humble beginnings  His father owned several small farms which specialized in the raising and selling of Berkshire hogs and Southdown sheep  The Civil War  however  robbed the Kerlin family of all but their land  Following his father s death in 1874  the eight year old Robert went to work on the family farms  Despite his family s financial woes  the young Kerlin was able to attend school for up to five months each year  In the spring of 1882  at the age of seventeen  Kerlin earned his teaching certificate and began his educational career at the Albany County Public School  In the fall of 1884  at the age of eighteen  he began his pursuit of higher education at Central College in Fayette  Missouri  Over the next several years he completed graduate work in the fields of English  History  and Philosophy at Johns Hopkins University  Harvard  and Yale  where he earned his Doctor of Philosophy in 1906  Kerlin went on to serve as a professor of English at several institutions including Missouri Valley College  Southwestern University  Yale  The State Normal School in Farmville  Virginia  and the Virginia Military Institute  From 1895 until 1898 Dr  Kerlin served as a minister in the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church where he later participated in the compiling of a new church hymnal  He extended his ministry into the armed forces by serving as a chaplain with the Third Missouri Volunteers during the Spanish American War  His time in the military inspired Kerlin to write The Camp Life of the Third Regiment  one of his many internationally renowned books  In the words of London  England s The Spectator   No other work deals so exhaustively and scientifically with the matters of which he wrote  Kerlin s other writings include  The Voice of The Negro  Contemporary Poetry of the Negro  The Church of the Fathers  Theocritus in English Literature  and Mainly for Myself  Kerlin and the VMI Controversy Dr  Kerlin served as a professor and Department Head of English at VMI from 1910 to 1921  In June 1921  his troubles began when his  Open Letter to the Governor of Arkansas  appeared in the  radical  anti segregation publication The Nation  He wrote this letter in response to the news that ninety two African American men had been sentenced to life in prison or execution following the Elaine Riot  The riot was an uprising which ensued after a gathering of African American men  women  and children were attacked by the Ku Klux Klan at their church in Hoop Spur  Arkansas  In the days following the attack  fifty to sixty African Americans were killed while attempting to defend themselves from their attackers  Six of the African Americans arrested were sentenced to death by the governor  In his
