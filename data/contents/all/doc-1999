Chessie Trail History of the Chessie Trail North River Canal Reids Dam The Chessie Nature Trail follows parts of the old canal towpath of the Maury River  known as  The North River  until it was renamed by the state legislature in 1945  Before the canal and its towpath came  the river was run by whitewater craft called batteaux  narrow wooden cargo boats like large canoes about 40 45 feet long and 7 feet wide  pointed at both ends  and steered by long oars  Replicas of these boats still run the Maury and other rivers in Virginia  In 1851  the North River Navigation Co  later bought out by the James River and Kanawha  canal  Co  replaced the whitewater navigation with a flatwater canal system for large canal boats up to 90 feet long  towed by mules and horses from a towpath  The canal was a combination of ditch and slack water navigation This company was responsible for extending canal construction along the North River up to the Lexington docks  which included the construction of Zimmerman s  Ben Salem  South River  and Reid s locks and dams   the remains of which can still be seen from the Chessie Trail  Boats   including packet boats carrying up to 60 people with room for social events  a kitchen bar  sleeping space  and toilets   started using the canal system on Nov  15  1860  The remains of two canal boats have been found in the river  and more may

Trail North River Canal Reids Dam The Chessie Nature Trail follows parts of the old canal towpath of the Maury River  known as  The North River  until it was renamed by the state legislature in 1945  Before the canal and its towpath came  the river was run by whitewater craft called batteaux  narrow wooden cargo boats like large canoes about 40 45 feet long and 7 feet wide  pointed at both ends  and steered by long oars  Replicas of these boats still run the Maury and other rivers in Virginia  In 1851  the North River Navigation Co  later bought out by the James River and Kanawha  canal  Co  replaced the whitewater navigation with a flatwater canal system for large canal boats up to 90 feet long  towed by mules and horses from a towpath  The canal was a combination of ditch and slack water navigation This company was responsible for extending canal construction along the North River up to the Lexington docks  which included the construction of Zimmerman s  Ben Salem  South River  and Reid s locks and dams   the remains of which can still be seen from the Chessie Trail  Boats   including packet boats carrying up to 60 people with room for social events  a kitchen bar  sleeping space  and toilets   started using the canal system on Nov  15  1860  The remains of two canal boats have been found in the river  and more may still be present  The North River canal was important for developing the economy of Rockbridge County  allowing passenger and cargo access to the larger markets of Lynchburg and Richmond  Jordan s Point  now the trailhead of the Chessie Trail at the Lexington end  became a manufacturing and storefront center for commercial activity in the county  housing stables  warehouses  flour mills  a foundry and forge  and many stores    The primary products shipped out along the North River included whiskey  iron  flour and wheat  leather  corn  and lime  During the Civil War  the North River canal became even more important for transporting supplies  So important  in fact  that U S  troops under Maj  Gen  Hunter burned the Reid s Dam lock gates and Jordan s Point mill and warehouses in 1864  For more information on Virginia s historical canals  see the resources provided by the Virginia Canals and Navigations Society  Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad As a result of problematic flooding and the increasing popularity of railroads  the James River and Kanawha Co  sold the property along the North River  now the site of the Chessie Trail  to the Richmond and Allegheny Railroad Co   later the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad Co  now the CSX Railroad  The railroad allowed for greater economic progress due to the high costs of canal maintenance and the improving capacity of rail transportation Because the railroad purchased new land for its track instead of laying it along the entirety of the canal towpath  much of the property was left in a relatively natural state  which can still be enjoyed along the trail  The James River Line and Lexington branch of the railroad was completed in 1881  still existing concrete markers along the trail with the notation  BF  and a number alerted railroad engineers to the distance in miles to Balcony Falls  an important stop near what is now Glasgow  Although many wanted the Lexington station at Jordan s Point  it ended up on McLaughlin Street near downtown Lexington  now the Omicron Delta Kappa headquarters  Jordan s Point  however  continued to be important for the railroad system  since Lexington was the end of the line and space in town was tight trains turned around just before reaching Jordan s Point and and backed into the city  This turn around included a fairly steep grade behind VMI  which allowed a perfect location for cadets to grease the tracks and stop the train s move into town   forcing the passengers to walk home from East Lexington  This mischief usually occurred when a W L football team was returning from a game  causing them to miss the welcoming group of students waiting at the downtown train station  or when an opposing team was coming into town for a match with VMI  exhausting them with the hike uphill before the match  The Cheapeake and Ohio Railroad Co  abandoned the railroad right of way in August 1969  when Hurricane Camille took out the wooden trestle across the Maury River parallel to Route 11  In 1978  the Nature Conservancy accepted the deed to the right of way from the railroad and held interim ownership until an appropriate permanent owner could be found  The VMI Foundation became that owner in May 1979  The deed was transferred in 2009 to Virginia Military Institute  which now maintains the trail for public use  A Rail Trail for All Ages Today  the Chessie Nature Trail is enjoyed by thousands of residents  students  and visitors each year  Establishing and maintianing this recreational resource cannot be done single handedly  Much of the initial work of converting the railbed to a trail was performed by the VMI Foundation with significant contributions of time and resources from local interest groups  Special acknowledgement goes to the Rockbridge Area Conservation Council  RACC  for ongoing advocacy of local trail systems  and Boy Scout Troop   29  which installed the original set of mile markers along the trail Chessie Nature Trail About the Trail History of the Trail Advisory Committee The Area
