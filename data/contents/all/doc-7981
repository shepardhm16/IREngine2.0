privilege to be able to help protect the place you were born and love  The Commonwealth s unique landscapes and wildlife are worth protecting  so future generations of Virginians have the same opportunity we had to explore and love our beautiful state  Under Lipford s leadership  The Nature Conservancy in Virginia has grown to be one of the largest  most successful  and most respected conservation organizations in the state  with a well earned reputation of working with all stakeholders to secure lasting results for Virginia s lands and waters  Those results include the protection of thousands of acres of ecologically significant land under his tenure  from the mountains of southwest Virginia to the marshes of Virginia s Eastern Shore  Most recently  Lipford led the Conservancy s efforts to secure the largest conservation easement in Virginia history  a 13 350 acre project in the Dragon Run and Mattaponi River watersheds in eastern Virginia  His nomination for the Erchul Environmental Leadership Award reads  In addition to Michael s outstanding land conservation leadership work here in Virginia  he is regularly called upon by The Nature Conservancy to help formulate and lead new conservation initiatives with regional  national and global impact  These range from his key role in formulating The Nature Conservancy s Eco regional Conservation by Design framework to a yearlong assignment in 2009 to formulate coordinated multistate land conservation initiatives in the mid Atlantic region  In addition to the lasting natural legacy he continues to leave for Virginia  Michael is universally admired and respected as a kind  thoughtful  and optimistic person  He is a conservationist steeped in a strong science background  He is passionate without being shrill  and committed without being confrontational  He is a gentleman conservationist and a true leader  The award includes a  1 000 donation to The Nature Conservancy in Virginia s Clinch Powell Clean Rivers
