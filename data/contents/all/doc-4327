Institute Lexington  VA  24450 Home   Academics   Areas of Study   Natural Science   Mathematics   CIS   Computer and Information Sciences Computer and Information Sciences Information  computing  and information technology play a dominant role in shaping the world and will be evermore pervasive as we progress into the 21st Century  Computer and information scientists design  analyze  plan  build and secure these systems  Within this broad area of design  the VMI CIS program provides cadets the opportunity to experience designing computer software components and implementing software systems as well as designing quality testing of products  We also provide training in the securing of software systems  digital forensics and exposure to product development of online and mobile platforms  The program provides a solid introduction to the general areas of CIS including programming  data base design and analysis  information retrieval  information architecture  software engineering  and human computer interaction  The opportunity to accomplish advanced individual or group study under the direction of a faculty member is a required experience in a two semester capstone  Mission   Vision Philosophy Guiding Principles Learning Outcomes Mission The Department of Computer and Information Sciences  CIS  is an evolutionary learning laboratory dedicated to preparing engaged learners endowed with computational thinking and the skills and vision to address real world problems  We emphasize excellence in teaching and provide a dynamic program integrating teaching  scholarship  service  and cadet development  Our program is driven by an engaged faculty and an innovative Computer and Information Sciences curriculum enriched with extensive practice and rooted in the VMI mission to shape the CIS leaders our world needs most  Those leaders are citizen soldiers with the character  honor  acumen and knowledge to navigate and affect change  accommodate ambiguity and surmount complexity  and motivate and inspire teams in a common purpose to create useful economic and social value  Vision To be the benchmark in preparing citizen soldiers as problem solvers applying Computer and Information Sciences knowledge and best practices  transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries  to create and develop appropriate user centric solutions to responsibly invent a better future  Given our evolving world that is now irrevocably instrumented and interconnected by computer networks  deeply embedded sensors  ever developing user centered devices and services  virtually infinite computing power  big data analyzers  and smart semi autonomic decision making  there is a need to broaden our historical perspective of  computer science  Our view is that cyberspace artifacts  or hardware  software  data and their orchestrations  comprise the basic infrastructure needed to allow humans  and human assemblies including teams  organizations  communities  etc  to work  develop and even play to their fullest potential  Such basic cyberspace artifacts would enable scientists  engineers and practitioners to research  create  and implement cognitive cyber physical equivalents to real world objects and environments  This will ultimately result in cognitive prosthetics and smart environments with new capabilities supporting and augmenting human capabilities  We surmise that  anchored in a commensurate perspective of  Computer and Information Sciences  embracing the world of cyberspace  the sciences  arts and humanities must be called upon and used synergistically to develop such new capabilities but with the human condition ever foremost  Any solutions and tools that would emerge must recognize that  tools for tools sake do not serve the human naturally  and so the needs of human ontological imperatives must be in the vanguard of requirements as our new Computer and Information Sciences  CIS  program evolves  advances  and continues to contribute to intellectual growth  The areas of concerns that are innately CIS must ultimately result from computer based concepts  paradigms  methodologies  and utilities that generate useful  efficient  and usable products and services  Such areas require deep understanding of the various ontological views of what it is to be human and the epistemological concerns in how humans most effectively acquire facts  information  knowledge  and develop wisdom  We see a primitive exemplar in the IBM Watson  The new CIS should harness and empower extensions of human physical and intellectual abilities through the use of computational thinking  aspect computing  for example  secure computing  interactive computing  collaborative computing  mobile computing  etc  and the synergy of at least the following intellectual domains  communication  information storage and retrieval  and data analysis for a wide range of inter linked arenas including but not limited to management science  mathematics  biological sciences  chemistry  physics  engineering  communication  our ERH and modern languages  military science  political science  economics  international studies  and social sciences  Overlaying such breadth is the further need to research and address moral  ethical and leadership issues of how to manage conflicts such as the tension between privacy and security and between economic growth and environmental degradation now expanding into uncharted realms of human physical and cognitive spaces    The new CIS major prepares the citizen soldier for civic and professional life through disciplined engagement with information technology theory and practice  Graduates will be able to apply their technical knowledge and skills to develop and implement computer solutions to achieve goals important to the industry  civilian or military components of government  or the research area in which they work  Graduates will have professional and ethical attitudes that foster immediate employment and for developing careers in both the civilian workplace and for military duty  These include a desire for continuing intellectual and professional growth as well as an awareness of ethics and the impact of computers on society  Graduates will have communication skills to function effectively in the civilian or military workplace and in society at large  Students who complete the CIS major should be able to  Demonstrate their ability to use fundamental computer and information sciences knowledge to design and implement software solutions to a range of problems  Demonstrate their ability to use a range of application software  operating systems  and programming languages  Be prepared to pursue further formal or informal learning based upon the fundamental understanding of the principles of computer and information sciences inherent in outcomes 1   2  Demonstrate their ability to effectively communicate verbally with appropriate use of visual aids  Demonstrate their ability to write both technical and non technical materials with appropriate visual materials  Demonstrate their ability to effectively conduct technical work such as software design and implementation in teams  Have an awareness and understanding of the impact of computer technology on society at large  the milieu in which they live and work  and on the individual human context  Have the ability to recognize and understand the importance of ethical standards as well as their effect upon the individual computer professional and upon the profession as a whole
