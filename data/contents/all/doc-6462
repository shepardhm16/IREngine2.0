  VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  Cadet Chemistry Research Yields Exciting Results LEXINGTON  Va  July 18  2014   The VMI chemistry department continues to go where no one has gone before  Funded by the Summer Undergraduate Research Program  Col  Darren Timmons and three cadet researchers spent the first summer session exploring the world of liquid crystals  and the group has made significant progress   They are making molecules that have never existed before  said Timmons of cadets Angelo Kirchon  16  Hayden Alford  16 and Austin Ross  17  who spent the first part of summer working in the chemistry lab   In addition to their liquid crystal properties  we are now studying a property we didn t anticipate    one that could be used in sensors or other devices  The program that makes it all happen   typically referred to as  SURP    has been part of chemistry department programming for nearly four decades  It paid the cadet researchers a stipend  offering them the opportunity to spend about eight hours a day  five days a week  in the lab developing liquid crystalline materials  substances that act as self organizing fluids   Our primary goal is to train the students in science  and having the private funds allows us to run the program  said Timmons   It is a great thing for the department and for our students  We think the students learn science best when they are engaged in real projects  Having the funds available for that simplifies the process  Timmons noted that many schools don t have much internal funding for student stipends  so they must seek out external grants  diverting faculty from valuable lab and teaching time  Added Timmons   Do you spend all of your extra time writing the grant that takes six months to hear back  or do you keep working in the lab with the students  Kirchon  who began working on the science of liquid crystals with Timmons last year  has created a whole series of the never before seen molecules  He s ready to start writing up his research  Alford and Ross  who are relatively new to the project  will continue to create new molecules when they return to the laboratory in the fall  While the team s current focus is on building these molecules  they keep an eye on potential applications  Liquid crystals are essential to liquid crystal display   LCD   units and also have some medical applications  such as in thermometers  Timmons said they haven t constructed their first device yet  but that hasn t dampened the cadets  enthusiasm   We ve sort of stumbled into this world of liquid crystals with our molecules  Timmons said   and thought   Wow  This is really interesting  let s explore this  And as we learn about them  I m confident we ll be able to turn them into a useful device   We do a lot of dancing in the lab when we make a new liquid crystal  added Timmons   It s really exciting to see the properties you had hoped for  The work of the Timmons group will be on display at the American Chemical Society convention this fall and at the VMI Undergraduate Research Symposium  generally held in April  both of which will give the cadets valuable experience making professional presentations   Chris Floyd
