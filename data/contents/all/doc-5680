Vickie Huddleston and Dr  Todd Moss    Photo courtesy of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  3  2011    When I first got the program and it said the Eagle and the Dragon  I wondered if it shouldn t have said the Eagle vs  the Dragon  This statement from the audience at the opening session of the  Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  an academic conference at Virginia Military Institute s Center for Leadership and Ethics  pointed at what was most striking in keynote remarks presented by an ambassador for the U S  Office of the Secretary of Defense and a fellow with the Center for Global Development  The view that emerged from the presentations was that China is neither a competitor in the arena of security nor a deathly threat in that of economics  Vicki Huddleston  deputy assistant secretary for Africa  and Todd Moss  vice president for programs and senior fellow at the Center for Global Development painted a nuanced picture of the emerging roles of the two countries and the developing relations between them for the audience  which included a large contingent of VMI cadets  Huddleston stated the goals of the United States in Africa  to promote democracy  economic development  and rule of law and to mitigate conflict  She gave strong praise to the efforts of the relatively new U S  Africa Command  which  she said  is providing the capacity to Africans  to African states  to African militaries so they can provide security and stability for their population so that they can be able to counter the transnational  threat    of terrorism    What AFRICOM does is build capacity of African militaries under civilian command  These goals are not  according to Huddleston  shared by China   From the security point of view  China isn t a competitor  it isn t even there  China and the United States do  however  have shared interests   My point to you would be that China and ourselves share the same goal in Africa  the goal being Democracy writ large   certainly economic development   and cultural relations  but where we differ  I believe  is in the means  Moss  who followed Huddleston on stage  noted that in the economic arena  China is  extremely active  and he accounted for the sense of tension between the United States and China by adding that  globally  the two countries are also the two largest economies  tied together by both trade and debt  Reassuringly  he added   It sometimes seems like we re competing  but it s mostly a mutual hostage situation  In Africa  both China and the United States want to see much more vibrant and productive African markets  markets much more integrated in the global economy  Both the United States and China  he said  have very important roles to play in Africa  which is one of the  engines  of economic growth   Six out of 10 of the fastest growing economies this year globally are in Africa  he said  The biggest constraints to growth in Africa are the cost and reliability of electricity and transportation  Also needed are access to financing and regulatory structures  In addressing these constraints  Moss said  the actions of the United States and China are often complementary  The United States tends to assist in development of regulatory structures and to invest in human capital  in schools and education and a healthier work force  The Chinese have a mechanism for building infrastructure    tons of infrastructure    wherever they are active  Areas of tension  said Moss  are Chinese investment in  rogue  countries  the Chinese tendency to encourage borrowing  and to make the funds available to borrow  in countries that recently completed United States led efforts to free them from oppressive debt  and transparency  which is viewed as essential by U S  companies and U S  regulators  but not by the Chinese  Competition for oil  often seen as a major threat  is not as dangerous as many think  he said  since that market is extremely fluid  Moss said that two strategies for assuring better financial growth in Africa would be for the United States to  unleash  the Overseas Private Investment Corp  from heavy regulation and to invest in multilateral financial systems  such as through the World Bank  Following the talks  accents from around the world were heard as members of the audience stood to ask questions  prolonging the discussion until time was called  The conferences continues with panel discussions today and tomorrow  a reception featuring cultural music from Sub Saharan Africa  and a keynote address this evening by Maj  Gen  Donald Christopher Leins  deputy director for politico military affairs  Africa  with the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff   Sherri Tombarge   VMI     VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories
