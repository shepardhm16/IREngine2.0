in mathematical biology  whose research uses mathematical models to understand the mechanisms of chronic respiratory inflammation  Several respiratory diseases result in respiratory inflammation even though these diseases have different origins  For instance patients with cystic fibrosis  CF    a genetic disorder   or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD  often associated with environmental causes  suffer from chronic respiratory inflammation  1  2  3  4  Inflammation scars the respiratory tissue reducing the health of the individual  Patients with these diseases often succumb due to respiratory problems  Using nonlinear differential equations  Herald creates realistic models which are based on the underlying biology and immunology  Analysis of these models uses various techniques such as bifurcation and stability analysis as well as numerical simulations  Understanding the mathematical models leads to biological predictions that may help explain behaviors of the system  help researchers focus experiments  or even suggest possible therapeutic targets 1  V  DeRose  Mechanisms and markers of airway inflammation in cystic fibrosis  European Respiratory Journal  19 333 340
