themselves and others  Having good mental health means being able to deal with the demands  challenges  and changes in everyday life  Regardless of age  race  sex  or status  everybody is subject to emotional upset  Feeling angry  down  or anxious is a normal reaction to life events and these emotions tend to come and go often  However  when these emotions persist for weeks or months  and begin to interfere with daily life  it may be a sign that professional help could be beneficial  10 characteristics of people who are mentally healthy  They feel good about themselves They do not become overwhelmed by emotions  such as fear  anger  love  jealousy  guilt  or anxiety They have lasting and satisfying personal relationships They feel comfortable with other people They can laugh at
