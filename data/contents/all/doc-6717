learned quickly upon arriving on post way back in August 2011 was that to survive the ordeal that is VMI  they had to band together  But in case they had forgotten  VMI superintendent Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62 quickly reminded them with his introductory remarks   Graduating from VMI is a great personal achievement  he said   but it is an achievement that cannot be reached alone  We must always recognize that success is not exclusively a matter of individual resolve  Nevertheless  after speakers Dominion Resources CEO Thomas F  Farrell II  valedictorian Henry W  Meredith  and class president William H  Connerley addressed the 317 graduating cadets  a number of individual honors were doled out  Robert Hardy Hendren  15  a biology major with minors in Arabic and French  was awarded the First Jackson Hope Medal  given for highest attainment in scholarship  and the accompanying Commander Harry Millard Mason Academic Proficiency Award  as well as the Society of Cincinnati Medal  for efficiency of service and excellence of character  and the Richard J  Marshall and Sumter L  Lowry Awards that go along with that prize  Hendren was named a Distinguished Graduate with Institute Honors and a Distinguished Military Graduate in Army ROTC  A native of Kentucky  Hendren commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U S  Army  Wesley Cade Jacobs  15 of North Carolina was the recipient of the Second Jackson Hope Medal and the Col  Sterling Murray Heflin  16 Academic Proficiency Award  An economics and business major  Jacobs was named a Distinguished Graduate with Institute Honors  He leaves VMI as a Distinguished Military Graduate and has commissioned into the U S  Army as a second lieutenant  An additional 17 cadets were tapped as Distinguished Graduates with Institute Honors  and 43 more earned Distinguished Graduate recognition  But  Peay said  while the individual effort should be applauded  none of the cadets made their way alone  Of course  Peay referenced the influences of faculty and family  and how their support is necessary for the success of any college graduate  For graduates of VMI  however  Brother Rats  those who endure and understand the day to day trials that are VMI  are essential for making it to graduation day and struggling through the inevitable failures along the way   When you are here at VMI  you will fail  said valedictorian Meredith  The Class of 2015 started with 509 on Matriculation Day four years ago  Many of them fell by the wayside  Those who went the distance  however  were able to persevere in large part because of the support and  as Meredith called it   love  of their Brother Rats   With each other  we overcome these failures  he said  adding   Through failure  and through love  we grow  Never let this parting last  I encourage all of you to keep these relationships for the rest of your lives    Congratulations on overcoming the trials of this ridiculous place  You are strong and full of love and more than ready to overcome any failure  That  as Farrell noted when he took the podium  is the history of VMI  In his address to the Class of 2015  Farrell  who is producer of the feature film Field of Lost Shoes  made numerous references to those brave cadets who fought at the Battle of New Market  Those cadets  he noted  ultimately  failed  in their mission  but their commitment to duty  honor  and each other  should provide inspiration for all VMI graduates   Those New Market cadets are a part of you  Farrell said   Those children had the hearts of lions  Each of you will get it right  You have history at your backs    Chris Floyd    VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families
