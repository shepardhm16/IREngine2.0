returned from Niger  Hentz  I did  I did  Tombarge  I was sort of interested in having you talk a little bit   weren t you working this problem over there from some angle  Hentz  I was  Well  indirectly  My trip to Niger was to what they call  train the trainers  So I was part of a three man team helping train the instructors at the Nigerien military academy  And the instructors whom I was with are on typically a two year rotation  They either have been to the front  which is Boko Haram  or they re going back to the front  Or the soldiers they re training are going back and forth from the front  Just days after I left Niger they had riots   I don t know if you re aware of this   literally days after I came back as a response to what France was doing and the cartoons and burnt down some churches and set some hotels on fire  I haven t found out if my hotel was set on fire  I don t know if I want to know if my hotel was set on fire  But Niger is a strong American ally right now  We re working very well with them  But the same substratum exists there as in northern Nigeria  These young men that are easily recruited into these sort of extremist movements because their lives just flat out are not very good and they see this as an option  maybe the only option  Niger s not doing that  they re not in there  but it s remarkable how I m there working as a representative of the United States government helping to promote U S  Nigerien relations and cooperation specifically in the fight against Islamic terrorism in the transahal and four days later there s riots in the capital because of their reaction to the political cartoons depicting the prophet in France  So it s a tinderbox  This part of the world is a tinderbox  Copyright   2015 Virginia Military Institute
