the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities   Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement  In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors  A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help    Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology  In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Bulger Barnett s help received clarification  Unless the work assigned is certified and specifically for a grade  you are encouraged to work together  For example  please read together  share dictionary work and any grammar review exercises assigned  At the end of the assignment  please cite the name s  of cadets with whom you are working  No help from another person whatsoever is permitted on anything else  Cite all items used  Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc  Col  Bulger Barnett Home
