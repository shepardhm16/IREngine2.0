Nanometers  It s kind of nice to be on the leading edge  That s precisely where physics major Alex Firehammer is completing his capstone project in VMI s thin films lab  Firehammer s project is to optimize the deposition process for optical filters on the lab s new automatic stainer  one of several devices purchased in the last five years with the assistance of the Jackson Hope and Mallory Hall renovation funds  In other words  Firehammer is working to identify the best automated process for creating thin films  Thin films are created in the VMI lab by dipping a microscope slide into a solution over and over again  each time adding layers  Holding up a translucent orange microscope slide  Firehammer said   I have about 50 layers on each side  about 150 nanometers  A nanometer is a billionth of a meter  explained Firehammer s faculty mentor Lt  Col  Daniela Topasna  Firehammer is dipping the films both by hand and by machine to test the automatic stainer s efficiency   With the machine we can dip 30 slides at any one time  said Firehammer   By hand  even five or six gets pretty hectic  Firehammer s interest in thin films originated in reports he did in his Modern Physics class  He came across a project using them to make solar panels  nanotechnology can make solar panels lighter  cheaper  and more efficient  At VMI s thin films lab  projects are under way using nanotechnology to make colored glass that absorbs certain wavelengths of light while allowing others through  creating optical filters that can be used in instruments  The same kind of technology can be used to make protective goggles  Firehammer s project builds thin films using a process based on electrostatic attraction  said Topasna  one of only two or three methods that allow control at the nanometer level  It s a method being investigated in a number of research projects all over the world   at Virginia Tech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in Germany and in Australia  In the electrostatic self assembly method  the slides are dipped in positive and negative solutions alternately  and the layers attract each other like magnets   The nice thing about the method is it s based on a water solution  you don t have to use nasty solvents  said Topasna   It s very environmentally friendly  Topasna said nanotechnology allows the creation of films coating any size or shape  the substrate  or form to be coated  can be anything  from polyester to metal to glass to polymers  And the films can be functionalized based on the materials used  polymers  nanoparticles  proteins  and DNA are among the possibilities   The tendency now is to make smaller devices  This is one of the methods to do that  said Topasna   As things get smaller  you run into the problem of quantum effects  Silicon technology is limited   traditional methods are reaching their limit   Two other thin film projects are also in progress at VMI  One is creating photovoltaic films  which convert solar energy into electric energy  as in solar panels  The other uses titania particles to create anti reflective coatings  such as to evade radar transmissions  Firehammer s thin films project is his second physics research project  Two summers ago  Firehammer s Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  SURI  project created a carbon dioxide laser   I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever done  said Firehammer  All this lab work has opened up the world of physics for Firehammer  who is one of only four physics majors graduating this May   It s a whole world of awful math  said Firehammer  reflecting on the five cadets in his class who switched from physics to other majors   Of course you get past it  You stick with it  and you re proud after you finish it   And the lab work has resulted in advanced training for Firehammer  both in the processes themselves   how to tell when something isn t working properly  for instance   and in how to use instruments that are so specialized their use is never taught in the classroom  In addition to trying out that automatic stainer  Firehammer has used the lab s scanning electron microsope  which magnifies 10 000 times  and its spectro photometer to assess the films he creates   Since Alex has started work on the project  he has demonstrated a good work ethic  initiative  and has been very efficient since the first tasks that were given to him  He is organized in the lab and does his best to apply the methods correctly  said Topasna  who has encouraged Firehammer to help identify and train a cadet to work in the lab next year  Firehammer will commission into the U S  Navy in May and has been selected to be a pilot  The cost of all those slides and solutions  and other supplies such as beakers  adds up  Firehammer received a grant this semester from the Wetmore Fund to help cover these costs  He was encouraged to apply by Topasna  who finds these grants helpful whenever she works with a cadet on an undergraduate research project  Administered by the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  the Wetmore Fund offers maximum grants of  300 for supplies for undergraduate research during the academic

Physics   Astronomy   Cadet Physics Project Measures Results in Nanometers Cadet Physics Project Measures Results in Nanometers  It s kind of nice to be on the leading edge  That s precisely where physics major Alex Firehammer is completing his capstone project in VMI s thin films lab  Firehammer s project is to optimize the deposition process for optical filters on the lab s new automatic stainer  one of several devices purchased in the last five years with the assistance of the Jackson Hope and Mallory Hall renovation funds  In other words  Firehammer is working to identify the best automated process for creating thin films  Thin films are created in the VMI lab by dipping a microscope slide into a solution over and over again  each time adding layers  Holding up a translucent orange microscope slide  Firehammer said   I have about 50 layers on each side  about 150 nanometers  A nanometer is a billionth of a meter  explained Firehammer s faculty mentor Lt  Col  Daniela Topasna  Firehammer is dipping the films both by hand and by machine to test the automatic stainer s efficiency   With the machine we can dip 30 slides at any one time  said Firehammer   By hand  even five or six gets pretty hectic  Firehammer s interest in thin films originated in reports he did in his Modern Physics class  He came across a project using them to make solar panels  nanotechnology can make solar panels lighter  cheaper  and more efficient  At VMI s thin films lab  projects are under way using nanotechnology to make colored glass that absorbs certain wavelengths of light while allowing others through  creating optical filters that can be used in instruments  The same kind of technology can be used to make protective goggles  Firehammer s project builds thin films using a process based on electrostatic attraction  said Topasna  one of only two or three methods that allow control at the nanometer level  It s a method being investigated in a number of research projects all over the world   at Virginia Tech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  in Germany and in Australia  In the electrostatic self assembly method  the slides are dipped in positive and negative solutions alternately  and the layers attract each other like magnets   The nice thing about the method is it s based on a water solution  you don t have to use nasty solvents  said Topasna   It s very environmentally friendly  Topasna said nanotechnology allows the creation of films coating any size or shape  the substrate  or form to be coated  can be anything  from polyester to metal to glass to polymers  And the films can be functionalized based on the materials used  polymers  nanoparticles  proteins  and DNA are among the possibilities   The tendency now is to make smaller devices  This is one of the methods to do that  said Topasna   As things get smaller  you run into the problem of quantum effects  Silicon technology is limited   traditional methods are reaching their limit   Two other thin film projects are also in progress at VMI  One is creating photovoltaic films  which convert solar energy into electric energy  as in solar panels  The other uses titania particles to create anti reflective coatings  such as to evade radar transmissions  Firehammer s thin films project is his second physics research project  Two summers ago  Firehammer s Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  SURI  project created a carbon dioxide laser   I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever done  said Firehammer  All this lab work has opened up the world of physics for Firehammer  who is one of only four physics majors graduating this May   It s a whole world of awful math  said Firehammer  reflecting on the five cadets in his class who switched from physics to other majors   Of course you get past it  You stick with it  and you re proud after you finish it   And the lab work has resulted in advanced training for Firehammer  both in the processes themselves   how to tell when something isn t working properly  for instance   and in how to use instruments that are so specialized their use is never taught in the classroom  In addition to trying out that automatic stainer  Firehammer has used the lab s scanning electron microsope  which magnifies 10 000 times  and its spectro photometer to assess the films he creates   Since Alex has started work on the project  he has demonstrated a good work ethic  initiative  and has been very efficient since the first tasks that were given to him  He is organized in the lab and does his best to apply the methods correctly  said Topasna  who has encouraged Firehammer to help identify and train a cadet to work in the lab next year  Firehammer will commission into the U S  Navy in May and has been selected to be a pilot  The cost of all those slides and solutions  and other supplies such as beakers  adds up  Firehammer received a grant this semester from the Wetmore Fund to help cover these costs  He was encouraged to apply by Topasna  who finds these grants helpful whenever she works with a cadet on an undergraduate research project  Administered by the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  the Wetmore Fund offers maximum grants of  300 for supplies for undergraduate research during the academic year  By  Sherri Tombarge IR   March 2012 Natural Sciences Physics and Astronomy
