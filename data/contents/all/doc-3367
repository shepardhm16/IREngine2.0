Academics   Research   Procedures and Criteria for Approval Procedures   Criteria for Approval The IRB requires that all investigators  including student researchers  must complete a free on line training tutorial offered by the National Institute of Health prior to submitting their protocols for review by the IRB  Completing the tutorial is self paced and it may be completed all at once or over the course of repeated visits to the site  Total time required to complete the tutorial is estimated to be about 2 to 4 hours  Investigators must include an electronic copy of their training certificate as a supporting document in their proposal to the IRB   Here is the link to the training http phrp nihtraining com users login php  Initial Approval The principal investigator may be asked to meet with the IRB should it be apparent that clarification or modification of statements in the application are required  No individual involved in the conduct and or supervision of the research project shall participate in its review  except to provide information to the IRB  The IRB may approve the project as is or may approve it with certain modifications required to meet federal standards  In the latter instance  the investigator will be informed by letter  The IRB approval letter will be sent upon written receipt of the modification  The faculty advisor will be copied on any correspondence sent to student investigators  If the IRB action is to disapprove the application  reasons for this negative decision will be provided in writing to the principal investigator or project director  If the researcher decides to modify the proposed research in such a way as to meet the objections of the IRB  the investigator may resubmit the modifications of the proposal for consideration of the IRB  If desired  the investigator may request a personal hearing with the IRB Committee  Continuing Review and Submission of Annual Update Complex and potentially dangerous projects will be reviewed at a frequency commensurate with the related risks  When initial approval of such a protocol is given  the IRB may indicate the need for re evaluation of the project after a specified interval so that continued acceptance of the protocol is assured  Projects that are determined to be exempt will not require additional review  Non exempt proposals are approved for a maximum period of one year only  For projects which continue beyond one year  it is the responsibility of the principal investigator to submit to the IRB an annual update  The first annual update is due twelve months following the date the proposal was approved and released  Upon receipt of the annual update the IRB will review and approve  if appropriate  continuation of the project for the next twelve month period  Investigators will receive one notification regarding the due date of an annual update  Failure to submit an update within 30 days following the due date will result in termination of IRB approval  Projects can be updated annually for a maximum approval period of five years  Continuation of projects beyond five years requires resubmission  If the IRB determines that a project requires review more often than annually  the investigator will be so notified  The IRB has the authority to directly observe ongoing research projects and the consent process as well as audit research records  When a project that has required continuing review is terminated completed  the investigator must immediately notify the IRB in writing  Ongoing projects modified to include humans or animals as subjects also must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval prior to the use of such subjects  In the case of an externally funded project  the granting agency would be notified of the IRB action prior to the appropriation cycle for a budget period during which human and or animal subject involvement is proposed   Reporting Proposed Changes in a Research Protocol Any proposed change in a protocol which affects the human or animal subjects must be reviewed and approved by the IRB prior to the implementation except where an immediate change is necessary to eliminate a hazard to the subjects  Investigators should submit a Request for Change in Protocol and a revised consent form as required  Minor changes during the period for which approval is in force will be reviewed by an expedited review procedure  If a change in protocol is relatively minor  e g  change in investigator  change in the sequence of follow up visits  it is not necessary to have the subject sign a revised consent form or an addendum to the consent form  If  however  the change is not minor  e g  addition of an intervention not addressed in the original consent form  disclosure of a previously unidentified risk  the investigator should have all new subjects sign a revised consent form and all currently enrolled subjects who are actively participating in the protocol sign an addendum to the consent form  If the change is considered significant  e g  disclosure of a serious risk  the use of a witness is required  Submission of a Report of Injury If a subject suffers an injury  the investigator must submit a Report of Injury to the IRB within 48 hours  Reporting Non Compliance with IRB Guidelines Any incident of non compliance with IRB Guidelines should be reported immediately to the IRB  Non compliance with IRB requirements is a violation of federal regulations for the protection of human and or animal subjects  IRB Applicants Create Account Login Administrator
