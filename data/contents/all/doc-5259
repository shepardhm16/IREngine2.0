Letter then Written by a Young Lady  Article  The shelling of Lexington in June 1864  by the Union forces under General David Hunter  is cleverly and graphically recalled in a letter written at the time by a young lady of Lexington  which has reached the County News office  having been preserved for nearly sixty years  The letter follows   Lexington  Va  June 17  1864 My dear Papa You are no doubt anxious to hear what has become of us all since the unexpected arrival of the Yankees and how we were treated by them  On last Thursday we were enjoying undisturbed quiet  having heard the Yankees had suffered a severe defeat from General Breckinridge  Imagine our surprise and fright on Friday evening when a courier came in stating that McCausland with his small force was a Cedar Grove and the Yankees at Brownsburg  A few minutes later another one brought news that the Yankees had reached Cedar Grove and McCausland had encamped on Colonel Cameron s farm  about three miles from town where they intended remaining for the night  Great excitement prevailed in town  many persons sent off their servants together with wagons loaded with provisions  and nearly all the gentlemen of town went went out into the mountains  in that way hoping to escape capture by the enemy  among them the cadets  and professors of both Institute and College with many of the citizens  On Saturday morning McCausland crossed the river and burnt the bridge  he deployed his men on the cliffs of the river above and below the mill where a stubborn resistance was made by our men  who at last retreated  Meanwhile the Yankees had reached an elevated field just opposite the town and planting their artillery in full range of the main street  they commenced shelling it  afterward assigning as a reason that they wanted to clear the streets of the  Rebels  who were passing up at the time  in which they were much mistaken  for McCausland being aware of their intention retreated up the back street  The first shell that struck our part of town passed through Mrs  Johnston s house  the next one above ours tearing a circular hole just the size of the ball  We were standing in the front door when the ball passed over our heads  and fearing danger we went to the cellar  thinking that was the safest place  and were standing on the steps when we heard the whizzing near us  we found that another one had passed through our garret wall and struck the rafter  exploding with a thundering noise  It knocked nearly all the plastering off and all the sash out of the windows  made a great many large holes in the wall and floor  One piece passed through the ceiling of the passage  two small pieces perforated the ceiling of grandpa s room just above the head of his bed in which he was lying at the time in a doze  and was aroused by the fall of the plaster  I seemed to have spent a lifetime in one day  I never before had an idea of the terror caused by the shelling of a town  never seemed to realize what it meant  In a few moments the alarm of fire was given  shells were flying thick and fast  Uncle was the first to run up to the garret and burst the door open where he was almost suffocated by the smoke which was discovered to proceed from the explosion and  not  from fire as was supposed  Not long after several white flags were hoisted by some of the citizens when the enemy in turn raised one and the firing ceased  The Yankees foiled in the expectations of crossing the bridge soon made a good ford and in about half an hour after the shelling ceased  the wretches galloped into the town yelling and whooping like so many savages  We kept the doors locked and the windows closed all the time they were here  Sunday morning about 10 o clock the Yankees set fire to the Institute  blew the walls down and destroyed the mess hall and professors  houses  and if General Smith s daughter  Mrs  Morrison  had not been very ill they fully intended destroying his elegant mansion  All the Point property except the miller s and toll houses was burned  Governor Letcher s house was burnt with but five minutes notice  The Yankees took Mr  Matthew White  Jr  prisoner and he was seen Sunday afternoon marching out of town with a squad of soldiers  who shot him for bush whacking  all the time deceiving his parents by telling them he was at home  His body was found unburied in the woods near Mrs  Cameron s house on the evening the Yankees left  Last Wednesday there was scarcely a Yankee to be seen anywhere in town  and our scouts captured the few stragglers that remained  On Tuesday morning I was aroused early by the rumbling of the artillery racing out of town with all its speed  before breakfast the whole front street far as the eye could see up and down was jammed with their wagon trains which seemed to be in the greatest possible hurry  and before 12 o clock all were gone except a few horsemen who seemed to be left as scouts  We were in high spirits you may know  and there never was so much rejoicing in town  I have heard of a great deal of destruction by the Yankees and a great many shells have struck houses in town  We heard that Uncle Thomas Wilson was in the woods with his servants and stock when some Yankees fell upon them  wounding him in the head and capturing his wagons  etc  Two of his servants came here night before last bringing us news about him  We hope he will recover  Colonel Massie came home yesterday  said he had seen you and spent a very sick night at your house where he received kind attention for which he seemed very grateful  thinks a great deal of you  We have it reported here this morning  20th  that the Yankees have gotten a good whipping at Lynchburg and are retreating  I hope they will not come this way  Uncle and Aunt write me in love to yourself  Mama  my brother and sisters and all friends  Do let us hear from you soon  Your affectionate daughter  Fannie M  Lyle Wilson  P S  We heard from Uncle Thomas last night  He was wounded right badly  He eye was shot out and the pistol was placed so near to his face that his hair was burnt  There are several deep saber cuts on his head  his wound is painful but not

News  Lexington  Virginia  in the 1920 s  The whereabouts of the original letter is unknown  In 1864  Fannie Wilson was sixteen years old  she was living with her aunt and uncle  Mr  and Mrs  Lyle Wilson  Fannie died a year after the letter was written  Full text of the newspaper article  ca  1924   Headline  Shelling of Lexington in 1864 Recalled in a Letter then Written by a Young Lady  Article  The shelling of Lexington in June 1864  by the Union forces under General David Hunter  is cleverly and graphically recalled in a letter written at the time by a young lady of Lexington  which has reached the County News office  having been preserved for nearly sixty years  The letter follows   Lexington  Va  June 17  1864 My dear Papa You are no doubt anxious to hear what has become of us all since the unexpected arrival of the Yankees and how we were treated by them  On last Thursday we were enjoying undisturbed quiet  having heard the Yankees had suffered a severe defeat from General Breckinridge  Imagine our surprise and fright on Friday evening when a courier came in stating that McCausland with his small force was a Cedar Grove and the Yankees at Brownsburg  A few minutes later another one brought news that the Yankees had reached Cedar Grove and McCausland had encamped on Colonel Cameron s farm  about three miles from town where they intended remaining for the night  Great excitement prevailed in town  many persons sent off their servants together with wagons loaded with provisions  and nearly all the gentlemen of town went went out into the mountains  in that way hoping to escape capture by the enemy  among them the cadets  and professors of both Institute and College with many of the citizens  On Saturday morning McCausland crossed the river and burnt the bridge  he deployed his men on the cliffs of the river above and below the mill where a stubborn resistance was made by our men  who at last retreated  Meanwhile the Yankees had reached an elevated field just opposite the town and planting their artillery in full range of the main street  they commenced shelling it  afterward assigning as a reason that they wanted to clear the streets of the  Rebels  who were passing up at the time  in which they were much mistaken  for McCausland being aware of their intention retreated up the back street  The first shell that struck our part of town passed through Mrs  Johnston s house  the next one above ours tearing a circular hole just the size of the ball  We were standing in the front door when the ball passed over our heads  and fearing danger we went to the cellar  thinking that was the safest place  and were standing on the steps when we heard the whizzing near us  we found that another one had passed through our garret wall and struck the rafter  exploding with a thundering noise  It knocked nearly all the plastering off and all the sash out of the windows  made a great many large holes in the wall and floor  One piece passed through the ceiling of the passage  two small pieces perforated the ceiling of grandpa s room just above the head of his bed in which he was lying at the time in a doze  and was aroused by the fall of the plaster  I seemed to have spent a lifetime in one day  I never before had an idea of the terror caused by the shelling of a town  never seemed to realize what it meant  In a few moments the alarm of fire was given  shells were flying thick and fast  Uncle was the first to run up to the garret and burst the door open where he was almost suffocated by the smoke which was discovered to proceed from the explosion and  not  from fire as was supposed  Not long after several white flags were hoisted by some of the citizens when the enemy in turn raised one and the firing ceased  The Yankees foiled in the expectations of crossing the bridge soon made a good ford and in about half an hour after the shelling ceased  the wretches galloped into the town yelling and whooping like so many savages  We kept the doors locked and the windows closed all the time they were here  Sunday morning about 10 o clock the Yankees set fire to the Institute  blew the walls down and destroyed the mess hall and professors  houses  and if General Smith s daughter  Mrs  Morrison  had not been very ill they fully intended destroying his elegant mansion  All the Point property except the miller s and toll houses was burned  Governor Letcher s house was burnt with but five minutes notice  The Yankees took Mr  Matthew White  Jr  prisoner and he was seen Sunday afternoon marching out of town with a squad of soldiers  who shot him for bush whacking  all the time deceiving his parents by telling them he was at home  His body was found unburied in the woods near Mrs  Cameron s house on the evening the Yankees left  Last Wednesday there was scarcely a Yankee to be seen anywhere in town  and our scouts captured the few stragglers that remained  On Tuesday morning I was aroused early by the rumbling of the artillery racing out of town with all its speed  before breakfast the whole front street far as the eye could see up and down was jammed with their wagon trains which seemed to be in the greatest possible hurry  and before 12 o clock all were gone except a few horsemen who seemed to be left as scouts  We were in high spirits you may know  and there never was so much rejoicing in town  I have heard of a great deal of destruction by the Yankees and a great many shells have struck houses in town  We heard that Uncle Thomas Wilson was in the woods with his servants and stock when some Yankees fell upon them  wounding him in the head and capturing his wagons  etc  Two of his servants came here night before last bringing us news about him  We hope he will recover  Colonel Massie came home yesterday  said he had seen you and spent a very sick night at your house where he received kind attention for which he seemed very grateful  thinks a great deal of you  We have it reported here this morning  20th  that the Yankees have gotten a good whipping at Lynchburg and are retreating  I hope they will not come this way  Uncle and Aunt write me in love to yourself  Mama  my brother and sisters and all friends  Do let us hear from you soon  Your affectionate daughter  Fannie M  Lyle Wilson  P S  We heard from Uncle Thomas last night  He was wounded right badly  He eye was shot out and the pistol was placed so near to his face that his hair was burnt  There are several deep saber cuts on his head  his wound is painful but not dangerous  Fannie  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination Statement

by a Young Lady   County News Lexington  Va  June 17  1864  My dear Papa You are no doubt anxious to hear what has become of us all since the unexpected arrival of the Yankees and how we were treated by them  On last Thursday we were enjoying undisturbed quiet  having heard the Yankees had suffered a severe defeat from General Breckinridge Imagine our surprise and fright on Friday evening when a courier came in stating that McCausland with his small force was a Cedar Grove and the Yankees at Brownsburg  A few minutes later another one brought news that the Yankees had reached Cedar Grove and McCausland had encamped on Colonel Cameron s farm  about three miles from town where they intended remaining for the night  Great excitement prevailed in town  many persons sent off their servants together with wagons loaded with provisions  and nearly all the gentlemen of town went went out into the mountains  in that way hoping to escape capture by the enemy  among them the cadets  and professors of both Institute and College with many of the citizens  On Saturday morning McCausland crossed the river and burnt the bridge  he deployed his men on the cliffs of the river above and below the mill where a stubborn resistance was made by our men  who at last retreated Meanwhile the Yankees had reached an elevated field just opposite the town and planting their artillery in full range of the main street  they commenced shelling it  afterward assigning as a reason that they wanted to clear the streets of the  Rebels  who were passing up at the time  in which they were much mistaken  for McCausland being aware of their intention retreated up the back street The first shell that struck our part of town passed through Mrs  Johnston s house  the next one above ours tearing a circular hole just the size of the ball  We were standing in the front door when the ball passed over our heads  and fearing danger we went to the cellar  thinking that was the safest place  and were standing on the steps when we heard the whizzing near us  we found that another one had passed through our garret wall and struck the rafter  exploding with a thundering noise  It knocked nearly
