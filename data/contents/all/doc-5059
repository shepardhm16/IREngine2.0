Remarks to the Class of 1965 April 24  2015 Members of the Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute feels very privileged to share it with you  In fact  this is the season of a number of anniversaries important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered were very much like today s Barracks  although they consisted only of Old and New Barracks  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  A large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  These were good times for many of VMI athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1962  the  Big Red  team won the Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back and congratulations  Class of 1965  Best wishes for a rewarding and enjoyable reunion and

Peay  III  Superintendent Remarks to the Class of 1965 April 24  2015 Members of the Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you

Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the

congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical

offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back and congratulations  Class of 1965

Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute feels very privileged to share it with you  In fact  this is the season of a number of anniversaries important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered were very much like today s Barracks  although they consisted only of Old and New Barracks  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  A large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  These were good times for many of VMI athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1962  the  Big Red  team won the Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with

philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper

Remarks to the Class of 1965 April 24  2015 Members of the Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute feels very privileged to share it with you  In fact  this is the season of a number of anniversaries important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered were very much like today s Barracks  although they consisted only of Old and New Barracks  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  A large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  These were good times for many of VMI athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1962  the  Big Red  team won the Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled

Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back and congratulations  Class of 1965

Peay  III  Superintendent Remarks to the Class of 1965 April 24  2015 Members of the Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute feels very privileged to share it with you  In fact  this is the season of a number of anniversaries important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered were very much like today s Barracks  although they consisted only of Old and New Barracks  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  A large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  These were good times for many of VMI athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1962  the  Big Red  team won the Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back and congratulations  Class of 1965

Members of the Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute feels very privileged to share it with you  In fact  this is the season of a number of anniversaries important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered were very much like today s Barracks  although they consisted only of Old and New Barracks  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  A large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  These were good times for many of VMI athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1962  the  Big Red  team won the Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who

Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper

important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around the sentinel box  The Barracks that you entered were very much like today s Barracks  although they consisted only of Old and New Barracks  A population  explosion  linked to the Post War Baby Boom  sent unusually high numbers of young people seeking a college education  and VMI was no exception  A large number of cadets in the Corps resulted in over crowding in the tight barracks space  In September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early  60s  and the Twist was the dance style for VMI Hops  These were good times for many of VMI athletic teams  especially its football team under Coach John McKenna  In 1962  the  Big Red  team won the Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back and congratulations  Class of 1965  Best wishes for a rewarding and enjoyable reunion and please return with regularity Gen  J H  Binford Peay  III  Superintendent Remarks to the Class of 1965 Remarks to the Class of 1965 April 24  2015 Members of the Class of 1965  spouses  and friends  Good evening and welcome back to VMI  Since graduating from the Institute  many of you have returned to celebrate class reunions five  ten  and twenty five years out  but surely nothing can compare with returning for the fiftieth reunion  This anniversary comes at a time when most of you have achieved the high goals that you set for yourselves in those formative days here at VMI  Now  new goals and adventures   perhaps not as pragmatic as the earlier ones   beckon you forward  This is a special moment  and the Institute feels very privileged to share it with you  In fact  this is the season of a number of anniversaries important in the history of the Virginia Military Institute  Last year  about this time  we celebrated the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  In November  we celebrated the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  We also observed the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War and the 75th anniversary of the beginning of World War II  And last month we observed the anniversary of the end of the American Civil War  VMI graduates have played influential roles in every aspect of American history since 1839  but their service in the three conflicts I have just mentioned did much to define the Institute and earn it a prominent place in the nation s history  We perhaps were not fully aware of it at the time  but the early 1960s were to prove to be another highly significant time in the history of our nation  Developments in world affairs  in society  and in science and technology were bringing about fundamental changes and setting new directions for the future  The conflict in Southeast Asia  the Civil Rights Movement  the Cold War  space exploration and many other remarkable developments in science and technology saw VMI graduates playing an active   often a leading   role  And you  as graduates of the Class of 1965  were clearly among those players  In January 1961  eight months before your arrival at VMI  President John F  Kennedy succeeded Dwight Eisenhower as the 35th President of the United States  ushering in what seemed at the time a new political era characterized as  The New Frontier  Soon after  the Peace Corps was established  the unsuccessful Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba took place  and Freedom Riders began riding buses into the South  In February of 1962  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  became the first U S  astronaut to orbit the Earth in the Mercury Atlas  Friendship 7  During that year  James D  Watson  Frances Crick  and Maurice Wilkins received the Nobel Prize for the discovery of the molecular structure of DNA  In the spring of 1962  United States forces were ordered to Laos  and President Kennedy announced that U S  advisors in Vietnam would fire if fired upon  In September  1962  as you began your third class year  the U S  Circuit Court ordered the University of Mississippi to admit African American student James H  Meredith  One month later  President Kennedy announced that the Soviet Union was building offensive weapons bases in Cuba and ordered a naval and air quarantine of offensive military equipment  I m sure you will always remember where you were a year later  on November 22nd  1963  when President Kennedy was assassinated at the end of the first semester of your second class year  February of 1964 saw the beginning of the British invasion when the Beatles appeared on the Ed Sullivan Show  In July  President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964  In March of 1965  the first American combat troops arrived in Vietnam  while 40 men at the University of California  Berkeley  burned their draft cards  And  as you were about to graduate  the first anti Vietnam  teach in  was held around the Pentagon  September 13th  1961   a Friday   was the day you matriculated at VMI  It marked the beginning of VMI s 122nd year  On that day  you began a 5 day  New Cadet Orientation and Training Period  better known as  Cadre  at the end of which the Old Corps returned and you were taken into the Rat Line  Many of you were probably influenced in your expectations of life at VMI by the 1957 movie Mardi Gras  starring Pat Boone  The reality was far different  In short order you had to learn to think  speak  and walk in new ways  You now talked in terms of CCQ  FEI  SMI  RQ  and many other foreign terms that were in your ever present Rat Bible  Life at VMI was conducted under the watchful eye of the Commandant of Cadets  Colonel Jeffrey G  Smith  VMI Class of 1943  and later by Colonel George H  Simpson  VMI Class of 1940  When you arrived  Colonel Smith was in his second year  The Superintendent  too  was new  Recently arrived from command of Camp Lejeune  Marine Brigadier General George R  E  Shell  VMI Class of 1931 was the Institute s 9th superintendent  Under General Shell and Colonel Smith  many of the day to day systems and requirements  including Rat Restrictions  were transformed  often to the chagrin of cadets  Shell and Smith were new leaders for a new decade  Your class historian noted of your Rat year that quote Doing their best to make the whole Rat year unpleasant  the Rat Disciplinary Committee marshaled us back and forth between the fifth  fourth and third stoops with amazing regularity  a floor show being provided at both ends   end quote  You became the Class of 1965 in the spring of 1962  the night before Spring Hike  an event followed by traditional Old Yells around

September 1963  the entering class of 1967 won the distinction of being the largest 4th class to enter VMI  with 362 matriculants  As a result  31 rooms on the first and second stoops were converted from 4 man rooms to 5 man rooms to accommodate the larger Corps  In October 1962  work was well underway on the erection of stands at Alumni Field  In 1963  site work was begun on the new George C  Marshall Research Library and on the new administration building  officially known as Smith Hall  There were many distinguished visitors to the Institute during your cadetship  but of great interest to the Corps were the nationally known musicians who came to entertain the Corps  including Bo Diddley  Fats Domino  The Lettermen  the Coasters  Clyde McPhatter  and the Drifters  This was the early

Southern Conference Championship  the fourth title in six years  In 1964  the Keydet basketball team won the Southern Conference Tournament with players like Bill Blair and Charlie Schmaus  Your second class year included the centennial celebration of the Battle of New Market and the dedication of the new George C  Marshall Research Library and Museum building  Present that day were President Lyndon Johnson and former President Dwight D  Eisenhower  along with many other state and national dignitaries  The New Market Medal was awarded posthumously to General Marshall and presented to Mrs  Marshall  On May 15th  1965  the traditional New Market Day ceremony was held as well as the dedication of the new Francis H  Smith Hall   the administration building  The principal speaker for the day was Senator Harry F  Byrd  A month later  on Sunday  13 June  Colonel John H  Glenn  Jr  delivered your graduation address and 229 of you received a VMI diploma  Eventually  242 classmates earned diplomas  Your Brother Rat John McClelland Marshall was chosen valedictorian  In those days  Finals extended over three days  with the first day devoted to military and athletic awards and the Finals Ball  the second day was Alumni Day  commissioning ceremonies  and the graduation parade  and the third day was graduation  Until Cameron Hall was built  graduation ceremonies were normally held in front of Preston Library  weather permitting  It was during your first class year  according to your historian   quote   You brought about a series of changes in policy and attempted to orient the class system in a direction such that it might approach the system that seems to have been so ideal twenty years before  It was a difficult road and mistakes were made  but overall we have succeeded in realigning the image and possibilities of the barracks under an extremely efficient class system   end quote  Leading your class were  Lou Siegel  president  Paul Shu  vice president  and  Greg Robertson  historian  When you graduated  you felt that you had made solid contributions to the development of VMI  and you were ready to make your mark beyond the limits of the Institute  What a record it has been  Of the total of 346 individuals listed as matriculants in the Class of 1965  a very unscientific survey shows  124 of you became businessmen  managers  investment professionals  bankers  or CEOs  25 entered the law  24 became educators  20 became engineers  19 had government service careers  15 chose military careers  10 entered the health services  2 were coaches and athletic directors  7 were scientists  5 were contractors  3 each entered the clergy and law enforcement  2 became professional pilots  and one a rancher  Of the total of matriculants  337 served in the Armed Forces  with five rising to flag rank  This record of service is superb  and this evening the Institute acknowledges your achievements and offers our warmest congratulations  But let us not spend our entire evening just looking back  Reunions are a time to  reconnect  with the Institute  learning where VMI is today and where it is heading  Despite the recent decade long economic downturn and other national challenges  I can report that the Institute is flourishing  its reputation is strong  its academic program has never been better  and our facilities across the entire post are in solid shape   Vision 2039  continues to be our roadmap  it is a statement of ambitious goals  It is a plan to improve cadets  education and personal development and to enhance the post s facilities  Since its inception in 2003  this long range plan has addressed the academic curriculum  military and athletic training programs  and the environment and culture of the Institute  seeking a more  common purpose  and greater  civility  in all that we do  The vision emphasizes leader development  synchronized and integrated across the Institute in every classroom  in every athletic program  in the regimental system  and in the barracks  Above all  it is a plan to ensure that VMI remains a state and national treasure at its 200th birthday in 2039  All the initiatives of  Vision 2039  are aimed at ensuring that VMI can meet the future needs of its graduates in a dynamic world environment  Over the years  VMI has been fortunate in attracting  outstanding  men and women to its faculty and staff  and the names of Turner  White  and Friske your classmates are testimony of that  Today is no different  We have recently selected a new Dean of the Faculty  a new Commandant of Cadets  a new Director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  and a new Athletic Director  about whom I will speak later  The new Dean  who reported last June  is BG Jeff Smith  VMI Class of 1979  GEN Smith completed a splendid thirty three  33  year Army career  principally in the Army s Signal Corps  with the latter portion of his career focused on cyber warfare  He has a Ph D  degree in English from Princeton and double majored at VMI in Biology and English  Our new Commandant is Colonel William J  Wanovich  who had been the Army Professor of Military Science since 2010  He is a graduate of the VMI Class of 1987 and succeeds Colonel Thomas Trumps  VMI Class of 1979  who had been  since 2007  the longest serving Commandant in modern times  And the new Director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics is Colonel David R  Gray  who comes to us after a 30 year Army career as an infantryman with significant senior leadership in Afghanistan  He has a Ph D  in Military History from Ohio State  The Institute will be well served with their senior leadership for years to come  Some of the most exciting developments at the Institute today are taking place in the academic program  Initiatives currently being implemented  with the goal of promoting greater vitality in the core curriculum and meeting  right sizing  objectives among the different disciplines and departments  include strengthening the writing and fine arts programs  and much more  in the Department of English and Fine Arts   now known as the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies   and incorporating into that department the current philosophy curriculum  Other initiatives include adding Mandarin Chinese in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  resulting now in foreign language offerings of Arabic  Mandarin Chinese  Spanish  and French  the renaming and focus of our Math degree to Applied Math  and  the creation of a new Department of Computer and Information Sciences  In the academic areas  as with all areas of the Institute  we must look deep into the future if we are to remain strong and vibrant and meet the needs of a changing world  Our faculty are truly high performing  This month two of our faculty  among thirteen from colleges state wide  received recognition awards as the outstanding instructors in the Commonwealth  Jim Turner  Head of the Biology Department  was one of those  Under his leadership  the Biology program  at the Institute  is thriving  Princeton Review  Forbes  U S  News and World Report  Atlantic Monthly  Money  and others have ranked VMI  well up  in the upper quartile of all national colleges   public and private  But it is also  word of mouth  and our ultimate  credential    the graduate   that favorably affects the reputation of the Institute  Our reputation continues to attract growing numbers of well qualified and talented young men and women  The 2014 matriculating cadets   Class of 2018   had over 2160 applications  Admissions numbers grow each year  and in quality  This past August  we matriculated 500 cadets from 37 states and the District of Columbia and 7 foreign countries  This is one of the largest matriculating classes in VMI s history  Of these new cadets  59  percent were from Virginia  73 were females   a record number for a VMI entering class  Ninety five were recruited NCAA athletes  59  percent are majoring in math  science  and engineering  and 41 percent in the more pure liberal arts  That incoming class had a grade point average of 3 7  With the addition of Third Barracks  the Corps  at the start of the current academic year numbered 1700 cadets at census date with an annual rolling average of 1677 over the past three years  I firmly believe that parents and many of America s youth want the unique VMI challenge and education one that provides a  value based  education resulting in honorable citizens and outstanding leaders for our nation and communities  VMI cadets  across all services  continue to do exceptionally well at the ROTC summer camps  consistently earning high marks and awards for their performance  Recently  the U S  Army Cadet Command and the General Douglas McArthur Foundation announced that the VMI Army ROTC Department had won the McArthur Award as the 2014 Outstanding Program in competition with the nation s six Senior Military Colleges and five of the Military Junior Colleges of their 1st Brigade  Eight schools  of which VMI was one  were selected among 275 senior programs across the country  This award is based on a combination of the school s commissioning mission  its cadets  performance on the National Order of Merit list and its cadet retention rate  This is a tribute to the leadership and example of the men and women comprising all of our ROTC departments  Fifty two percent of the 1st Class graduating this May will earn a commission across all services volunteering to serve in time of war an improvement from 33  over the decade  This year  VMI is experiencing the lowest indiscipline and attrition in its history  As you know  VMI was one of the first members of the Southern Conference  starting in 1924  and remained in that conference until 2003 when we entered the Big South Conference  The Big South was a solid home for VMI athletics for ten years  VMI won the Big South sportsmanship award eight of those years  Recently  VMI was invited to return to the Southern Conference  The Board of Visitors accepted the invitation  and that move took place 1 July 2014  We were fortunate to hire Dr  David L  Diles as our new Athletic Director  who took the place of retiring Coach Donny White  who had done a truly outstanding job  with great class  leading our athletic program over so many years for the Institute in the toughest athletic environment in our country  Dr  Diles has a Doctorate in Education from the University of Michigan and most recently was the athletic director at NCAA Division III member Case Western Reserve  Before that  he was the AD at two Division I schools Eastern Michigan and St  Bonaventure  As happens periodically with faculty and in the coaching profession  VMI is currently experiencing a significant number of head coaching changes  We feel that our NCAA athletic future is  promising  across all sports  Our club sports programs are nationally  internationally  and team or individually ranked in lacrosse  rugby and power lifting and our boxing team upset Michigan to win the national collegiate boxing championship among 28 colleges last week  Creating an environment to facilitate and encourage the major goals of  Vision 2039  by necessity  has meant improving  updating  and expanding our physical facilities  This has been  perhaps  the most visible aspect of  Vision 2039  with major changes to North  Main  and South Posts  On 11 November 2013  we rededicated the New Science Building  as Maury Brooke Hall  a  19 6 million full modernization that gives us the very best technologically enhanced classrooms and labs  We secured state resources of  120 million to build or modernize three separate Corps Indoor Training Facilities  this entails programming  20 million for a major rebuild of Cormack Hall  you knew that as  The Pit  as the new home of the Physical Education Department with its popular new minor in Exercise Science  and includes the new Thunder dome for NCAA cadet wrestling  modifying Cocke Hall  last renovated in 1923  at  20 million as a Corps support building with a modernized massive Corps weight room  new locker rooms  basketball courts  enhancements for Hops  and much more  and  a new  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility  located on Route 11 adjacent to Cameron Hall  which provides an indoor facility for Corps fitness  drill  confidence courses  high rope courses  rock climbing  endurance training  rappelling  coaches offices  and a world class adjustable banked Olympic indoor track  Construction on this project has commenced  and when completed in 2016  this facility will be one of the most outstanding of its kind on the eastern seaboard  These three projects  transform  our South Post  facilitate training  particularly in bitter weather  thru out the academic year  and also aesthetically enhances the principal entrance to Lexington all the while promoting Corps fitness  discipline  confidence  and NCAA athletics  After a decade of state financial cuts to higher education across the Commonwealth  state support this year approximates 16 percent of our total operational budget  No college president in the country is happy with the cost of education as exemplified by rising tuition and fees  We offset these costs with financial aid  merit aid  ROTC scholarships  and other directed donor support  A major source of new funding for the Institute will come from our new major comprehensive fundraising campaign  whose theme is  An Uncommon Purpose  A Glorious Past  a Brilliant Future  The Campaign Cabinet is chaired by Mr  Don Wilkinson  61 and the goal is to raise  225 million to support all aspects of the Institute  The  public phase  of this ambitious campaign was officially announced at the VMI Foundation s Institute Society Dinner celebrating VMI s 175th year this past November  At the end of February  we had received more than  205 million in gifts and commitments from more than 12 000 alumni and friends  These gifts will make the academic program stronger and bolster the co curricular programs that prepare every cadet for lives of service and leadership  Your  commitment  at parade tomorrow is treasured and we are most grateful  The Institute continues to stand on the bedrock of personal honor as described in VMI s historic Honor Code  In its fundamental expectations and requirements  the VMI Honor System and the Honor Court basically remain as you knew them  There have been slight  procedural  changes  but no changes in the standards or in the penalties  Education continues to be key to our success in countering the plague of cheating that is rampant in our middle and high schools today  That education for our Rats and their transformation commences  literally  within 5 minutes of meeting their cadre on matriculation day  and  continuing education  for the Old Corps is seen by our commitment to hosting national Honor Conferences and emphasis by all at VMI  The VMI Honor System is the most cherished of all our systems  and we work tirelessly to ensure its integrity and effectiveness  I am personally involved  but allow and support the Honor Court in its administration of the system across the Corps  Terrific things are happening every day at the Institute  I firmly believe that the future holds even greater things for our school and its graduates  and that its reputation will rise to even greater heights  I am confident that the Institute will continue to provide generations of informed  skilled  fit  confident  dependable men and women of the highest integrity for our state and nation  Welcome back and congratulations  Class of 1965  Best wishes for a rewarding and enjoyable reunion and please return with regularity                                                                       VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni VMI
