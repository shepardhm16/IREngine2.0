STEAL OR PURLOIN AND PASS OFF AS ONE S OWN IDEAS  WORDS  WRITINGS  ETC  OF ANOTHER  Webster s New Collegiate Dictionary  Plagiarism is dishonorable  It involves using the words  information  insights  or ideas of another without crediting that person through proper citation  Since authorship is ownership  using the intellectual property of others without credit is theft  Passing off another person s work as your own is lying  You can avoid plagiarism by fully and openly crediting all sources used  Anytime you use someone else s words in your paper  those words  phrases  sentences  paragraphs  should be rendered in quotation marks  and cited by a footnote  If you decide to use someone else s words in any form  you must use quotations in order to show that you are borrowing the same  For further reference concerning the proper way to footnote  see the History Department s Guidelines for Referencing Papers  Parallelism  Parallelism means paraphrasing material but keeping a source s argumentation and paragraph structure  This is not acceptable  Not only words and phrases and sentences require footnotes  If you borrow someone else s ideas  you must also acknowledge the fact by a footnote  Even if you cite another person s ideas in your own words you must indicate this with a footnote or it constitutes plagiarism  Give credit where credit is due  You wouldn t want people to steal your property     don t steal theirs  You will have to use other people s discoveries and concepts to write your paper  but build on them creatively  Do not compromise your honor by failing to acknowledge clearly where your work ends and that of someone else begins  Footnotes  Your Safety Net and First Line of Defense  Footnoting and providing citations is not an admission that you don t know enough to write a term paper on your own  No scholar is so knowledgeable that he or she can write a research paper without consulting other scholars  research  all scholars rely on the work previously done by others  Instead  citations are proof that you have consulted the relevant literature and  therefore  know what you re talking about  Footnotes are ammunition  not admissions  Footnotes are your first line of defense against a plagiarism charge  Footnoting is an indispensable part of a term paper in any history course  Footnotes function as signposts to provenance  as indicators of the research that undergirds the paper  Readers want to know   where did you get that statement   how do you know   is this your own idea  The footnote helps answer these questions  The footnote should clearly show where you  the researcher and writer  got the information and data and ideas that form the substance of the paper  the book itself  the letter itself  etc  Sources  either primary or secondary  that you have not personally consulted and used must not be cited because the rule is cite only what you have directly and personally used  Do not pad your bibliography with citations you haven t seen yourself  Summary  Provide proper citation for everything taken from others  These include interpretations  ideas  wording  insights  factual discoveries  charts  tables  or appendices that are not your own  Citations must clearly and explicitly guide the reader to the sources used  whether published  unpublished  or electronic  Cite a source each time you borrow from it  A single citation  concluding or followed by extended borrowing  is inadequate and misleading  Indicate all use of another s words  even if they constitute only part of a sentence  with quotation marks and specific citation  Citations may be footnotes  endnotes  or parenthetical references  Paraphrase properly  Paraphrasing is a vehicle for conveying or explaining ideas borrowed from a source  and requires a citation to the original source  It captures the source s meaning and tone in your own words and sentence structure  In a paraphrase  the words are yours but the ideas are not  It cannot be used to create the impression of originality  Facts widely available in reference books  newspapers  magazines  etc  are common knowledge and need no citation  Facts that are not common knowledge but are derived from the work of another must be cited  Interpretations and theories provide an author s assessment of a set of facts and commonly embody that author s opinion  The interpretations and theories of another must be cited in footnote  endnote  or parenthetical reference  Always err on the side of caution  When in doubt  CITE IT  The History Department of VMI
