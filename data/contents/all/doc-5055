Superintendent Nov  3  2014 Distinguished guests  Cadets  students  ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the Virginia Military Institute and to this conference on leadership and national security affairs during the Reagan presidency  and on the influence of the Reagan era on today s national security issues  When this conference was first envisioned  few perhaps realized just how far current tensions between East and West would escalate  Russian actions and ambitions in Ukraine and veiled threats to a number of former Soviet Republics have us talking  once more  of an East West confrontation and give added importance to our understanding of the final years of the Cold War  This conference  titled  The Enduring Legacy  provides us a timely opportunity to discuss leadership  strategy  and international security affairs between 1981 and 1989  There are some real differences between the Cold War issues and contemporary challenges  thus  we must understand the past to effectively respond to the challenges facing the United States and the world today  The sessions to come will examine the Reagan presidency and its handling of national security affairs  To do so  we are privileged to welcome a large number of very distinguished scholars and national security professionals  The names of our panelists  chairs  commentators  and hosts are in your program  so I won t repeat them at this time  but I would like to extend a special welcome to our two keynote speakers  former NATO commander Admiral James G  Stavridis  USN  Ret  Dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University  and former U S  ambassador to the Soviet Union Jack F  Matlock  Jr  The three panels today will examine   The Leadership of Ronald Reagan  The Organization and Function of the National Security Establishment  and The Soviet Union and the United States Tuesday morning s fourth panel in three breakout sessions will discuss Reagan and  the Americas  the Middle East  and Europe  And  we will conclude with the discussion of  Reagan  Gorbachev and the End of the Cold War  VMI is proud to host this important conference  It is a collaborative effort of  the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis  the V M I  Center for Leadership and Ethics  the Wheatley Institution  and the George C  Marshall Foundation  The Adams Center  an element of VMI  focuses on Cold War military history and the connections between the Cold War and contemporary national security affairs  the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics promotes leadership and character development  the Wheatley Institution at Brigham Young University is devoted to  lifting society by preserving and strengthening its core institutions  and the George C  Marshall Foundation perpetuates General of the Army George C  Marshall s legacy as a military leader  statesman  and author of  The Marshall Plan  I am especially pleased to welcome the many college students who are attending this conference  Not only will you gain a deeper understanding of the importance of the Reagan years  but as future national security professionals and leaders  you can evaluate and weigh for yourselves the policies and actions taken by the Reagan administration and relate them to the challenges and opportunities we face today  On behalf of the entire VMI community  I extend to all of you a warm welcome and best wishes for informative and stimulating discussions  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index
