study in the fall  these other risks moved to the forefront this summer  One of his major undertakings was trying to find a way to make Reid s Lock  one of four such structures along the Chessie Trail  a safer place  The lock  once used for barges that cruised the Maury River back in the late 1800s  is a 21 foot structure that is accessible from the trail  Noted for its historic significance  the lock also offers a view of the natural sights along the river  Currently  however  visitors are protected solely by a rusty metal railing   We want to replace that  said Pike   I ve spent a lot of the first part of my internship trying to figure out how to replace that railing  make that area accessible enough to people so they can go in and soothe their curiosity but make it safe enough so they aren t going to endanger themselves  For his part  Pike has been charged with drawing up preliminary sketches for improvements addressing safety issues at the lock  His plan includes wooden railings  beveled at the bottom to discourage climbing  with vinyl chain link fencing between the rails  His blueprint recommends a 3  foot height  high enough to meet OSHA safety standards but not so high as to discourage sightseers   The height allows people to take pictures and gives an unobstructed view to the lock below  he said   Part of what we wanted to do is let people see these ruins  Though Pike is still a student and his designs cannot be used as official plans  his ideas can be put forward when the planning goes to a professional  And so far  Pike s work has impressed his superiors   In my opinion  he is mature beyond his academic age  said Maj  Jennifer deHart  VMI s former staff engineer and sustainability coordinator   I think we re going to get a really good result and give someone an educational opportunity  It s really a win win situation   I like what I m seeing  added Col  Gary  Doc  Rogers  professor of civil and environmental engineering and Pike s mentor on the project   He has come up with some good sketches and illustrations  He s a very enthusiastic student  and he s doing a good job with whatever he is putting his hands to  Pike has also designed a new gate system that will allow easier portage through the gates for bikers while also ensuring that the gates remain closed to please landowners  And it seems that every time he goes out to the trail  he finds another area that needs attention   I liked working with my professors here  getting that   extra knowledge that nobody gets  said Pike  noting that much of his work this summer has centered on historical research   The scope of what I need to do keeps expanding  That  said Rogers  means work on the Chessie Trail may not be confined to this summer   I can see this as an ongoing involvement

111 Smith Hall Lexington  VA 24450 Cadet Intern Takes on Trail Safety Issues Intern Josh Pike inspects a bridge on the Chessie Trail    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  LEXINGTON  Va  July 20  2015   Josh Pike  17 has spent much of his summer outdoors  battling poison ivy  snakes  and an environment that continually tosses surprises his way  No  he isn t going through training to prepare himself for commissioning into the U S  Army   that ll wait for another summer  The civil engineering major is spending this summer working as an intern for the VMI Physical Plant  surveying the Chessie Nature Trail and offering suggestions to make it a safer and more pleasant experience for all of its users   The trail is like a seven mile long civil engineering lab  Pike said   There s so much stuff going on  The summer project was not supposed to get as involved as it has  Initially  Pike was supposed to study only the rock fall problem along the trail  but as he began his first surveys  he discovered that there were many more issues   We knew we wanted to look at rock fall  but what I realized when I was out there was there are a lot of different types of hazards  he said   Not only do you have rock fall  but you have erosion and a lot of  attractive nuisances  things visitors to the trail would be tempted to go and explore  And they pose a significant risk    Work this summer clearing the brush and a planned replacement of the railing will make Reid s Lock more accessible to hikers    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV    See more photos on the VMI photo blog    While rock fall remains an important part of Pike s work  something he will likely look at in more depth as part of an independent research study in the fall  these other risks moved to the forefront this summer  One of his major undertakings was trying to find a way to make Reid s Lock  one of four such structures along the Chessie Trail  a safer place  The lock  once used for barges that cruised the Maury River back in the late 1800s  is a 21 foot structure that is accessible from the trail  Noted for its historic significance  the lock also offers a view of the natural sights along the river  Currently  however  visitors are protected solely by a rusty metal railing   We want to replace that  said Pike   I ve spent a lot of the first part of my internship trying to figure out how to replace that railing  make that area accessible enough to people so they can go in and soothe their curiosity but make it safe enough so they aren t going to endanger themselves  For his part  Pike has been charged with drawing up preliminary sketches for improvements addressing safety issues at the lock  His plan includes wooden railings  beveled at the bottom to discourage climbing  with vinyl chain link fencing between the rails  His blueprint recommends a 3  foot height  high enough to meet OSHA safety standards but not so high as to discourage sightseers   The height allows people to take pictures and gives an unobstructed view to the lock below  he said   Part of what we wanted to do is let people see these ruins  Though Pike is still a student and his designs cannot be used as official plans  his ideas can be put forward when the planning goes to a professional  And so far  Pike s work has impressed his superiors   In my opinion  he is mature beyond his academic age  said Maj  Jennifer deHart  VMI s former staff engineer and sustainability coordinator   I think we re going to get a really good result and give someone an educational opportunity  It s really a win win situation   I like what I m seeing  added Col  Gary  Doc  Rogers  professor of civil and environmental engineering and Pike s mentor on the project   He has come up with some good sketches and illustrations  He s a very enthusiastic student  and he s doing a good job with whatever he is putting his hands to  Pike has also designed a new gate system that will allow easier portage through the gates for bikers while also ensuring that the gates remain closed to please landowners  And it seems that every time he goes out to the trail  he finds another area that needs attention   I liked working with my professors here  getting that   extra knowledge that nobody gets  said Pike  noting that much of his work this summer has centered on historical research   The scope of what I need to do keeps expanding  That  said Rogers  means work on the Chessie Trail may not be confined to this summer   I can see this as an ongoing involvement with civil engineering cadets  Rogers said   There is so much there  This is just the tip of the iceberg    Chris Floyd    VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos Cindy Bither Administrative
