24450 Institute Report  October 2007   By Wendy Lovell Beginning with the Class of 2010  all VMI cadets will be required to take PS 344  Leadership in Organizations  Several members of the third class are completing the new course in the core curriculum this semester  and they are joined by a few firsts and seconds  as well as the commandant  heads of the ROTC department  the chaplain and the chief of staff of athletics     PS 344 is a valid  research based academic course that is focused on the dynamics of character based leadership in an organization  said Col  Thomas N  Meriwether  professor of psychology and primary designer of the course   This is not a magic wand but a piece of the puzzle that not only contributes to the academic mission but also more broadly to the positive development of the young men and women we at the Institute are entrusted with for their education and development  he added    An interdisciplinary study of leadership  the course integrates both theory and practice  focusing on the interaction between leaders  followers and the situational context of the leadership process  Consistent with Vision 2039  the course includes self assessment  self disclosure  small group exercises and analysis of films and case studies    Cadets will take the course in the spring of their third class year or the subsequent fall   Most of what we learn on leadership is from people who don t do it right  said Col  Thomas H  Trumps  79  commandant of cadets   I think looking at leadership from a theory level is good  Cadets are exposed to a variety of leadership styles here at VMI   from coaches  ROTC leaders  their professors and in Barracks   and this schoolbook piece will allow them to compare and process what they see from different areas of Post     My staff deals primarily with the top 10 and the bottom 10 of the Corps  and I m not able to touch the remaining 80 percent as much as I d like  he added   This course will help wedge some of the gap     There s so much good here at VMI  that s what I d like to see us focus on  and I think this course will help us move the Corps forward and grow    Cadet K  Marshall Cox  10 has found PS 344 to be a dynamic learning experience  and he hopes to apply lessons learned to his role as a clerk in the Cadre and a member of the Rat Challenge Headquarters staff     This class is a prime example of theory and philosophy smacking into practicality with such force that anyone standing near is sure to be impacted  said Cox   Now when I am faced with a challenging situation as a leader  I feel like I know myself so much better and am able to use my strengths to my advantage while being aware of my weaknesses    Cadet Eric Hunter  08  commander of Company E and president of Sigma Beta Delta  said he has learned a lot about his personal leadership style from PS 344     This course has brought fun back into talking and learning about leadership  said Hunter   It is a course that demands a lot out of you in order to learn  and I ve found the benefit that comes from knowing my blind spots and trying to make them stronger    Students and staff aren t the only ones learning from PS 344 this semester  Meriwether and fellow leadership team members Col  Herb Barber and Maj  Dave Cotting are assessing the new program as they teach in order to refine the course to lead 10 more sections in the spring     I m pleased so far with the course and the direction in which we re going  said Meriwether   We ve done our best to design a course that addresses real issues  is interactive  relates to VMI s unique and specific leadership challenges and is applicable to leadership roles at the Institute  in the military and in civilian life  Meriwether has taught psychology at VMI for 11 years  including courses focusing on leadership  Barber and Cotting joined the faculty this summer thanks to funding by a Jackson Hope grant that is supporting all three positions for the next five years    Barber came to VMI from the National Institute of Standards and Technology  where he was director of leadership and employee development  Previously he was on the faculty of the Army War College and James Madison University    Cotting served as deputy director of research for the Army Physical Fitness Research Institute and was a research psychologist at the Walter Reed Army
