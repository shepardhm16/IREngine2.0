NPR Journalist Discusses Supreme Court Coverage LEXINGTON  Va  Feb  17  2015   Well known National Public Radio journalist Nina Totenberg reminisced about her 47 years covering the U S  Supreme Court in a speech given at VMI yesterday  Totenberg began her remarks with a few anecdotes about the nine justices of the country s highest court  many of whom she has interviewed personally   Every time you look at those justices in their black robes  you have to remember that they are people  said Totenberg  who is legal affairs correspondent for NPR s news programs All Things Considered  Morning Edition  and Weekend Edition  To illustrate her point about the humanity of the jurists  Totenberg told a humorous story about now retired Justice David Souter  who drove home to New Hampshire each summer when the court s term was ended  On one of those drives  Totenberg said  Souter was approached by a man who asked him if he were a Supreme Court justice  When Souter answered in the affirmative  the man turned to his wife in triumph and exclaimed   See  I told you it was Justice  Stephen  Breyer  Souter was too polite to correct the couple  Totenberg said  but when the inquirer asked the justice what he liked best about serving on the Supreme Court  the misidentified jurist got the last laugh  as he replied   Serving with Justice Souter  After the laughter of her audience had died down  Totenberg dove into the heart of her talk  exploring how the court  and the society it serves  has changed since she first covered its deliberations in 1968  Noting that she d been covering the court long before any of the justices currently serving took their seats  Totenberg said that the court s makeup in the late 1960s consisted of one Catholic  one Jew  seven Protestants  one African American  and no women  Today s court is made up of six Catholics  three Jews  no Protestants  one African American  and three women  The justices  background has changed as well  Totenberg said  The 1968 court included several justices who d held elective office  while today all but Justice Elena Kagan have come up through the federal court system  The issues facing the court in the late 1960s were also quite different from those under consideration today  Totenberg noted  with many cases then related to the politically and culturally polarizing Vietnam War  In 1968  the court ruled 7 2 in Tinker v  Des Moines Independent Community School District that students have First Amendment rights to free speech while on school property  The case had come about after a group of students had decided to wear black armbands to school to show their support for a truce in the war and were subsequently suspended from school  In recent years  the court has dealt with issues related to the war against terrorism  specifically the detention of suspected terrorists by the federal government at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  In a 5 4 decision in 2008  the court held that detainees at Guantanamo Bay had the constitutional right to challenge their detention there   While the Supreme Court dealt a firm rebuke to the Bush administration about the way it dealt with suspected terrorists  detaining them without charge and without a chance to rebut  the court left the details of how that decision was to be carried out to the  Washington  D C  federal courts  said Totenberg  Trial courts have ordered that some Guantanamo prisoners be released  she said  but higher courts have overturned all of those decisions and the Supreme Court has not questioned those judgments   In short  I think it is fair to say that the Supreme Court s decisions on this subject have turned out thus far to create a right but not a real remedy for detainees found to be wrongly detained  said Totenberg  Also on the docket in the late 1960s were many cases having to do with civil rights and school desegregation plans  Totenberg noted that the court ruled in 1968 that schools in both Mississippi and Alabama must desegregate immediately  without further ado   The justices  quite simply  had had it with delaying tactics  Totenberg commented  By contrast  she continued  today s court takes a very different stance toward racial issues  In 2013  by a 5 4 vote  the court struck down a key part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  by allowing several southern states to change their election laws without federal approval   In the race cases that remain  the court is deeply divided  said Totenberg  She added that affirmative action at colleges and universities  is hanging by a thread  Totenberg also touched briefly on gay rights and the very real possibility that this year  the court will declare prohibitions on gay marriage unconstitutional  Totenberg noted that when she first began covering the court in 1968  even a discussion of this issue would have been unthinkable  Most recently  the court has refused to block gay marriages from taking place in Alabama  Reflecting on her many decades covering the court  Totenberg said she was reminded of a quote by the famed Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes  who served on the court from 1902 to 1932   We are very quiet here  but it is the quiet of a storm center  In addition to her radio work  Totenberg has published articles in publications including the New York Times Magazine  the Harvard Law Review  and the Christian Science Monitor  Totenberg is the only radio journalist to have won the National Press Foundation award for broadcaster of the year  She has been honored eight times by the American Bar Association for continued excellence in legal reporting  Totenberg s appearance at VMI was part of the H B  Johnson Jr   26 Distinguished Lecture Series   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI
