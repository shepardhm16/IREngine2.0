applied mathematics at Virginia Military Institute  has been selected to receive a 2016 Outstanding Faculty Award by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia  David  who has been teaching at VMI since 2011  was one of two recipients statewide to receive the Rising Star Award  an honor bestowed on faculty members showing extraordinary promise at the beginning of their academic careers  Selection for the Rising Star Award is based on performance in four areas  teaching  discovery  integration of knowledge  and service  All of the honorees will be recognized at an awards ceremony and luncheon to be held at the Jefferson Hotel in Richmond in February 2016  Just prior to that ceremony  the honorees will be introduced on the floor of the General Assembly  As a teacher  David has received stellar evaluations  Cadets in his classes have praised him for his willingness to help them find answers without giving too much assistance  as well as his deep knowledge of the subject matter and lively  engaging manner in the classroom  David has also developed a new class in mathematical modeling  and is currently working with VMI s Department of Economics and Business to develop a new minor in business analytics  At VMI  one of David s most well known contributions is the Applied and Industrial Mathematics program  which allows cadets to use the skills they ve learned in their applied mathematics classes to solve real life problems for corporations and nonprofit organizations  Among the many projects carried out under the aegis of this program have been predicting tire rubber performance using neural networks for the Goodyear Tire Co  building software to design search routes for piracy detection for the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory  and using algorithms to find optimal meal delivery routes for the Valley Program for Aging Services Meals on Wheels Program  Thanks at least in part to the Applied and Industrial Mathematics Program  cadets who ve worked under David have found employment  graduate school placement  or internships with a number of prestigious companies and institutions  among them the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory  Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory  NASA  and JP Morgan  Discovery  or research  is another area in which David has made substantial contributions  Since 2007  when he received his doctorate from North Carolina State University  he has published 11 peer reviewed articles  and nine conference proceedings  In addition  David recently signed his first book publishing contract for Predicting Conflict  A Multi method Approach  This book takes hundreds of quantitative and qualitative descriptors of each country for the last 70 years and describes how to apply data mining and machine learning techniques to predict international conflict  David s efforts to pass on knowledge have not stopped at the classroom door  or with the publishing of papers in scholarly journals  Even before his arrival at VMI  he was contributing to the growth of knowledge in his field  Since 2005  David has mentored 61 individuals doing independent research  or an average of six per year  That number has increased to seven per year since David joined the VMI faculty  The OFA program is administered by SCHEV and funded by a grant from the Dominion Foundation  which has fully supported the OFA program since 2005   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets
