intermediate Spanish by presenting texts drawn from many fields of interest  politics  business  literature  history  and culture  Conducted in Spanish  Emphasis will be placed on strengthening reading and writing skills  Prerequisite  SP 202 or SP 204  Click here for daily assignments and quiz exam information Course goals and methods  The goal of Spanish 315 is to bridge the lower level language skills of reading  writing  speaking and understanding to a post intermediate language level  Students will reach post intermediate levels of vocabulary  grammar  pronunciation  composition and readings  The student incorporates the skills through spoken and written Spanish in the classroom  and assignments are geared toward reading  writing  and pronouncing well  This is primarily a readings course and articles read will be from various fields including current events  politics  business  literature  and history  The daily structure of the class will be reading and discussing written articles in order to improve reading comprehension  Students will then restate articles in their own words in both written and spoken form so that they strengthen vocabulary  grammar  and overall use of the Spanish language  Homework and reading assignments are not  certified  since they are not for a formal grade  per se  However  if you have worked with another student  a tutor  or any other individual  it should be noted in writing  You may use dictionaries and other tools to help you and I ask that you specify what they are  Cadets who are unprepared or without a copy of the day s article may be asked to leave the class  Text  A good Spanish English dictionary  Recommended Larousse  Many are available for check out from Preston Library  Grading Scale  The grading scale will be as follows  A 90 100 B 80 89 C 70 79 D 60 69 F 50 59 Grade distribution  Vocabulary journals  20  Quizzes  20  2 one hour examinations  30  Final Examination  30  Vocabulary journal 20  Students will keep a vocabulary journal in EXCEL throughout the semester  You will enter into a spreadsheet all new words learned from each written article  You will include the Spanish word and article in one column  the English word in another  a Spanish synonym in a third column  use a thesaurus for help  and a sentence in which you use the new word in a fourth  By the end of the semester this will be an extensive list  Please save it to the M drive so that it is not lost accidentally  Vocabulary journals will be submitted on a weekly basis  due on Fridays  and each week s words should include any words from the articles read that week  In cases where a student s vocabulary is extensive and no new words are learned from the articles  I will work with that student individually to reinforce vocabulary use  Quizzes   20  Quizzes will test reading comprehension  vocabulary growth  grammar  pronunciation and listening ability  and composition  Some quiz grades will be from compositions  Others will be of an oral aural nature  In case of absence  a quiz may be taken in advance or via email the same day as the class is taking it  You may not take quizzes after the class has already done so  Make up   late policy  There will not be any make ups given  If a cadet knows in advance that he she will be absent the day of an incoming grade  he she is expected to complete the assignment early  In cases of guard  most of the time you are able to come to class for an exam or a quiz  Otherwise  tell me in advance and I will make arrangements for you to take it  One hour tests 30  There will be two one hour exams  Final Examination 30  The final exam will be comprehensive  Accommodations  VMI abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990  which mandate reasonable accommodations be provided for cadets with documented disabilities  If you have a registered disability and may require some type of instructional and or examination accommodations  please contact me early in the semester so that I can provide or facilitate provision of the accommodations you may need  If you have not already done so  you will need to register with the Office of Disabilities Services  the designated office on campus to provide services for cadets with disabilities  The office is located in Room 215 A of Carroll hall  you may call 540 464 7765 or stop by the office for more information  Help received clarification  Unless the assigned work is certified and specifically for a formal grade  cadets are encouraged to work together  However  FOR YOUR PROTECTION it should be noted in writing at the end of the assignment if help was received  and from whom  Computer drills are not certified and you have
