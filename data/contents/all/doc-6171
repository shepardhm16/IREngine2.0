and culture  Conducted in Spanish  Emphasis will be placed on strengthening reading and writing skills  Prerequisite  SP 202 or SP 204  Click here for daily assignments and quiz exam information Course goals and methods  The goal of Spanish 315 is to bridge the lower level language skills of reading  writing  speaking and understanding to a post intermediate language level  Students will reach post intermediate levels of vocabulary  grammar  pronunciation  composition and readings  The student incorporates the skills through spoken and written Spanish in the classroom  and assignments are geared toward reading  writing  and pronouncing well  This is primarily a readings course and articles read will be from various fields including current events  politics  business  literature  and history  The daily structure of the class will be reading and discussing written articles in order to improve reading comprehension  Students will then restate articles in their own words in both written and spoken form so that they strengthen vocabulary  grammar  and overall use of the Spanish language  Homework and reading assignments are not  certified  since they are not for a formal grade  per se  However  if you have worked with another student  a tutor  or any other individual  it should be noted in writing  You may use dictionaries and other tools to help you and I ask that you

will be submitted on a weekly basis  due on Fridays  and each week s words should include any words from the articles read that week  In cases where a student s vocabulary is extensive and no new

Spanish  Emphasis will be placed on strengthening reading and writing skills  Prerequisite  SP 202 or SP 204  Click here for daily assignments and quiz exam information Course goals and methods  The goal of Spanish 315 is to bridge the lower level language skills of reading  writing  speaking and understanding to a post intermediate language level  Students will reach post intermediate levels of vocabulary  grammar  pronunciation  composition and readings  The student incorporates the skills through spoken and written Spanish in the classroom  and assignments are geared toward reading  writing  and pronouncing well  This is primarily a readings course and articles read will be from various fields including current events  politics  business  literature  and history  The daily structure of the class will be reading and discussing written articles in order to improve reading comprehension  Students will then restate articles in their own words in both written and spoken form so that they strengthen vocabulary  grammar  and overall use of the Spanish language  Homework and reading assignments are not  certified  since they are not for a formal grade  per se  However  if you have worked with another student  a tutor  or any other individual  it should be noted in writing  You may use dictionaries and other tools to help you and I ask that you specify what they are

new word in a fourth  By the end of the semester this will be an extensive list  Please save it to the M drive so that it is not lost accidentally  Vocabulary journals will be submitted on a weekly basis  due on Fridays  and each week s words should include any words from the articles read that week  In cases where a student s vocabulary is extensive and no new words are learned from the articles  I will work with that student individually to reinforce vocabulary use  Quizzes   20  Quizzes will test reading comprehension  vocabulary growth  grammar  pronunciation and listening ability
