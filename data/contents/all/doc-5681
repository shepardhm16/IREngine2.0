China are like two elephants in the grass when it comes to development in Africa  That was the colorful metaphor employed throughout the first panel discussion of VMI s  The Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  conference on Nov  3  The session put questions on the table for the conference participants to consider   There is a saying that when two elephants fight  the grass suffers  said Sheila Siwela  ambassador of the Republic of Zambia to the United States   When two elephants don t fight  the grass grows  Narcisse Tiky  assistant professor in residence at the University of Connecticut Storrs and research associate at the John Goodwin Tower Center for Political Studies at Southern Methodist University  expanded on the metaphor   I would like to say that when two elephants fight  all the sheep go  to stay away  said Tiky   They stay away and wait for the fight to be over  so that the sheep will actually come and pick up the pieces  Is that what s happening in Africa  Joining Siwela and Tiky in the discussion was Soji Adelaja  professor of land policy and director of the Land Policy Institute at Michigan State University  The discussion was chaired by Donald Sparks  professor of international economics in the School Of Business Administration at the Citadel  Siwela highlighted the different roles that China and the United States have traditionally played in Africa  with the United States investing in social and educational programs and China investing in infrastructure  Adelaja acknowledged the range of benefits that have been brought to Africa  but focused his comments on the motivations that China has for investment in Africa  He explained the extreme ends of those motivations  on one end is an altruistic interest in the development of Africa and on the other is a neo colonial interest in exploiting Africa s resources  China s motivations lie somewhere between these extremes  and those motivations are driven by the increasing demands of the Chinese people   We re talking about massive growth in the consumption of food in China  and that raises the question  where is that food going to come from  said Adelaja  Add to that China s appetite for natural resources  and motivations for Chinese involvement in Africa are strong  Adelaja supported his statements by showing consumption trends in China as well as pointing out the resources Africa has to offer   When we ask the question  Is China good for Africa  or  Is the United States good for Africa  I would like to suggest that our partners in Africa spend a little bit more time looking beyond what is currently happening and try to understand motivations  connecting the dots  Tiky raised the question of who benefits from U S  and Chinese involvement in Africa   The question would be  is this competition good for the Africans  for the African people  said Tiky   We know that the governments are benefiting  but are the African people benefiting  Sparks took the elephant metaphor a step further at the end of the discussion  pointing to the danger to Africa of a close relationship between China and the U S  in African affairs   One last point about the elephant parable  said Sparks   When two elephants make love  the grass suffers   John Robertson  VMI    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
