In one whirlwind month this summer  a group of 24 VMI cadets experienced life abroad in a way that very few college students do  when they traveled to Berlin  Germany  and stayed with host families there  The trip  which has taken place each summer since 2011  is a joint undertaking of Col  Jon Michael Hardin  professor of mechanical engineering  and his wife  Patricia Hardin  who serves as program director for the trip  Of the cadets who went on this year s trip  18 were mechanical engineering majors  while six were students of the German language  The group left the United States on May 19 and returned on June 19  As in years past  the mechanical engineering cadets spent their mornings in two classes taught by Col  Hardin  dynamics  a traditional engineering course  and global engineering  a civilizations and cultures core course developed by Hardin that focuses on global trends in engineering in both the United States and the European Union   It s very difficult for engineering cadets to go abroad  noted Hardin  Engineers must take sequential courses  he explained  and if an engineering major goes abroad  it s likely that he or she will fall behind in the curriculum  Because of this  Hardin developed both the curricula and the trip to meet cadets  needs  Singling out the global engineering course for special praise was Cadet John Merten  16  a mechanical engineering major making his first trip to Germany   The global engineering course  cannot be taught back in the States as effectively as it was in Germany  he wrote in an email   and  the new knowledge I have of the importance of cultural competency in an international work place could be of considerable value later on in my career  The cadets studying the language  meanwhile  took morning classes at an accredited German language school in Berlin  where they were taught by German professors   and like the engineering cadets  they went home to German speaking households each evening  Although he d been studying German since middle school  Cadet Tom Moriarty  17 said that it is this immersion that gave his language skills the boost they needed   Before the trip  I had always been somewhat timid when speaking German because I didn t know at what level I knew the language  Moriarty explained in an email   From the trip  I gained a new confidence in my German speaking abilities  as well as learning new vocabulary  picking up the accent more  and learning some idioms and slang  Merten  meanwhile  recalled his host family with warmth   especially considering that when he stepped on the plane to leave the United States  he was already missing his own family back home in North Palm Beach  Fla  and he wasn t sure how well he d adapt to life abroad  Those doubts turned out to be totally unwarranted   My host family  had the same dinner table conversations as I would have with my folks back home  wrote Merten   My host mom had the same concerns on whether I  or my host brother or sister  were dressed warm enough for the weather  My host brother and sister even argued over the same things that I would with my sister  I built a great relationship with them and still am in good contact with them  It s that linguistic and cultural immersion that gives the VMI program its strength  Col  Hardin noted  plus the fact that the program is faculty led  American students abroad in dorms  form little islands of Americanism  the mechanical engineering professor noted  whereas staying with host families forces them to grapple with a new language and culture head on  Likewise  the relationship he and his wife  who has taught German at VMI and works in the Center for Undergraduate Research  already have with the cadets makes it easy and comfortable for the cadets to raise questions and challenge assumptions   We have a dialogue about what they re seeing and what they re experiencing  he said  This year s trip was packed with sights and experiences  ranging from the chillingly infamous Buchenwald concentration camp to the magnificent Baroque city of Dresden  heavily damaged in World War II but still a major art and cultural center in Germany  Ten of the cadets also took an optional weekend trip to the Black Forest region of Germany and the Alsace region of France  Throughout the trip  all cadets went on afternoon excursions  some geared toward the engineering cadets and some toward those studying the language  For the engineers  there were guided tours of factories belonging to such corporate luminaries as Rolls Royce  BMW  and Siemens  while the language students were exposed to Cold War Germany through a trip to the Stasi Prison Hohensch nhausen  a secret state police prison in former East Berlin that once housed prisoners who opposed the Communist regime  Other excursions  such as that to the Reichstag  the seat of the German government  were intended for the cultural benefit of all cadets  said Patricia Hardin  The cadets also met the U S  ambassador to Germany  John B  Emerson  Hardin explained that the cadets have met the current ambassador each year since 2011  thanks to an inside VMI connection  Theresa Dowling  wife of Lt  Col  Timothy Dowling  associate professor of history  works at the U S  ambassador s office in Berlin  Col  Hardin recalled that Emerson not only took the time to meet with the cadets and talk about his role and goals  but he also had a member of his staff speak with them about possible internship opportunities at the embassy   We are definitely going to follow through with that  said Hardin of the internship opportunities   It really lets  the cadets  become aware of all of the opportunities out there in the world and the fact that they are doable  He added that he wants the cadets to come away with an attitude of   Don t limit yourself  Look far and wide and see what s out there  The cadets  it seems  are glad that they took that opportunity to look   Before going to Berlin I knew next to nothing about Germany or German culture other than what I had seen in World War II movies  wrote Merten   Living and eating every day with a German family was an invaluable and unforgettable experience  Moriarty concurred  writing   I genuinely felt like a member of  the host family  I know that if I were to go back to Berlin  they would welcome me once again into their home as a member of their family    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non
