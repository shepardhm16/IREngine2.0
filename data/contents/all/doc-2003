Plants and Wildlife on the Chessie Trail Mammals Up to 43 species of resident and transient mammals may be present at some point in the ecosystem around the trail  visitors to the trail may have the opportunity to see and identify some of these mammals  Riparian corridors serve as very important habitats for a wide variety of mammals  Large mammals will use the ridgetops around the corridors or the riparian right of way to travel  while smaller mammals hide in the thick cover  one reason why extensive grooming and cutting around the trail is not used  River mammals  of course  rely on both the riparian buffer and the water itself for habitat  Observing mammals on the trail may be very difficult because they are adapted to blend in and hide from potential predators  When looking for mammals  be sure to walk quietly and look carefully for signs of inhabitation  tracks  burrows  scat  etc  The most common mammals observed along the trail are the same ones seen in local backyards   white tailed deer  gray squirrels  opossum  raccoons  cotton tailed rabbits  and groundhogs  Although voles are the most common mammal in the area  they are very rarely seen because they are small and very secretive  and often underground  The Eastern mole  also living mostly underground  may be identified by its furrows  Right before the trail closes  bats may be seen swooping erratically overhead  some of seven or eight known species in the area  In places along the trail where the view to the river is clear  watch for aquatic mammals  river otters  beavers  and muskrats  and riparian species  raccoon and mink  Birds   Belted Kingfisher   Photo Dick Rowe Birds seen along the trail may be residents or migrants  The Maury River is an important breeding area for some migrants and a  rest stop  for others  Widely varied habitats along the river   pastureland  riparian buffer  mature trees   allow for a diversity of bird species to flourish  Spring migrants come here from areas south to breed or to move yet further north  while fall migrants pass through from north to south  Common birds seen year round include downy woodpeckers  crows  mourning doves  Carolina chickadees  blue jays  white breasted nuthatches  kingfishers  and Northern cardinals  Summer residents include indigo buntings  orioles  yellow billed cuckoos  tree swallows  barn swallows  red eyed vireos  and eastern towhees  Birds that pass through in spring and fall include yellow rumped warblers  golden crowned kinglets  brown creepers  winter wrens  and white throated sparrows  Great blue herons and other wading birds may be seen accessing the river  and a bald eagle nest has been spotted from the trail near the Buena Vista end  View Col  Rowe s Flickr photo gallery of local birds Download Birding and Plant

apple  Podophyllum peltatum  pawpaw  Asimina triloba  solomons seal  Polygonatum biflorum  spicebush  Lindera benzoin  and wild ginger  Asarum canadense  Trail users will also observe an abundance of alien invasive plants common to the area  with the worst including tree of heaven  Ailanthus altissima  Japanese stilt grass  Microstegium vimineum  garlic mustard  Alliara petiolata  Japanese honeysuckle  Lonicera japonica  and other invasive honeysuckles  and autumn olive  Elaeagnus umbellate  Alien plants are species that exist outside of their natural range  they become invasive if and when they start spreading and aggressively outcompeting native species in the area  Alien plants can evolve to become invasive very quickly  often driving out native plants that are important food sources for birds and insects  They are much more likely to take hold in areas of chronic disturbance and edge habitats   which is why they can commonly be observed around Jordan s Point  with a history of human ecosystem disturbance  and along the edges of the trail  In the past 200 years  the spread of alien invasives has become particularly potent due to increased worldwide commerce and travel  Only strict prevention and eradication can mediate the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning caused by these species  The book Bringing Nature Home  by Douglas Tallamy  is a good reference for alien invasive species and how to support native ecosystems using your own backyard  View the Invasive Alien Plants in Virginia List Download Birding and Plant Checklist For further

resident and transient mammals may be present at some point in the ecosystem around the trail  visitors to the trail may have the opportunity to see and identify some of these mammals  Riparian corridors serve as very important habitats for a wide variety of mammals  Large mammals will use the ridgetops around the corridors or the riparian right of way to travel  while smaller mammals hide in the thick cover  one reason why extensive grooming and cutting around the trail is not used  River mammals  of course  rely on both the riparian buffer and the water itself for habitat  Observing mammals on the trail may be very difficult because they are adapted to blend in and hide from potential predators  When looking for mammals  be sure to walk quietly and look carefully for signs of inhabitation  tracks  burrows  scat  etc  The most common mammals observed along the trail are the same ones seen in local backyards   white tailed deer  gray squirrels  opossum  raccoons  cotton tailed rabbits  and groundhogs  Although voles are the most common mammal in the area  they are very rarely seen because they are small and very secretive  and often underground  The Eastern mole  also living mostly underground  may be identified by its furrows  Right before the trail closes  bats may be seen swooping erratically overhead  some of seven or eight known species in the area  In places along the trail where the view to the river is clear  watch for aquatic mammals  river otters  beavers  and muskrats  and riparian species  raccoon and mink  Birds   Belted Kingfisher   Photo Dick Rowe Birds seen along the trail may be residents or migrants  The Maury River is an important breeding area for some migrants and a  rest stop  for others  Widely varied habitats along the river   pastureland  riparian buffer  mature trees   allow for a diversity of bird species to flourish  Spring migrants come here from areas south to breed or to move yet further north  while fall migrants pass through from north to south  Common birds seen year round include downy woodpeckers  crows  mourning doves  Carolina chickadees  blue jays  white breasted nuthatches  kingfishers  and Northern cardinals  Summer residents include indigo buntings  orioles  yellow billed cuckoos  tree swallows  barn swallows  red eyed vireos  and eastern towhees  Birds that pass through in spring and fall include yellow rumped warblers  golden crowned kinglets  brown creepers  winter wrens  and white throated sparrows  Great blue herons and other wading birds may be seen accessing the river  and a bald eagle nest has been spotted from the trail near the Buena Vista end  View Col  Rowe s Flickr photo gallery of local birds Download Birding and Plant Checklist Plants   May Apple    Garlic Mustard

triloba  solomons seal  Polygonatum biflorum  spicebush  Lindera benzoin  and wild ginger  Asarum canadense  Trail users will also observe an abundance of alien invasive plants common to the area  with the worst including tree of heaven  Ailanthus altissima  Japanese stilt grass  Microstegium vimineum  garlic mustard  Alliara petiolata  Japanese honeysuckle  Lonicera japonica  and other invasive honeysuckles  and autumn olive  Elaeagnus umbellate  Alien plants are species that exist outside of their natural range  they become invasive if and when they start spreading and aggressively outcompeting native species in the area  Alien plants can evolve to become invasive very quickly  often driving out native plants that are important food sources for birds and insects  They are much more likely to take hold in areas of chronic disturbance and edge habitats   which is why they can commonly be observed around Jordan s Point  with a history of human ecosystem disturbance  and along the edges of the trail  In the past 200 years  the spread of alien invasives has become particularly potent due to increased worldwide commerce and travel  Only strict prevention and eradication can mediate the loss of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning caused by these species  The book Bringing Nature Home  by Douglas Tallamy  is a good reference for alien invasive species and how to support native ecosystems using your own backyard  View the Invasive Alien Plants in Virginia List Download Birding and Plant Checklist For further information We recommend consulting quality field guides
