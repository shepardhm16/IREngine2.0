the  often hidden  value basis of conducting research  Evaluation  Evaluations will be based on five tests  one test after every two chapter interval  There will also be a mid term examination  Because in class demonstrations and discussions form an essential and integral part of the learning process  it is critical that every member of the class be actively involved in this aspect of the course  As evidence of class participation  students will be required to submit one illustration  see below of a topic discussed in the previous chapter  These illustrations will be due on the day of

illustration  The illustrations will not be returned  therefore if you wish to keep a copy for your records  ensure that you submit a high quality copy of the items you wish to retain  Students will be awarded marks for class participation  which will be based mainly  but not exclusively  on the illustrations  Given the elaborate nature of this participation process  10  of the total course score

regulations regarding work that has been submitted in consideration for a grade  The appropriate section most pertinent to this course is attached below  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for a successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feelings about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct

Social Psychology Behavior and experiences of the individual in society  group dynamics and social institutions  human relations  morale and leadership  Prerequisite  PS 201  Course Description   Objectives  As an introductory course in social psychology  PS 302 is designed to expose students to the scientific study of human social behavior  It is also meant to stimulate critical thinking and enable students to relate social psychological principles to everyday experiences  Lectures will be based primarily on the assigned text  although supplementary materials and discussions will be frequently assigned by the instructor  In order to facilitate the understanding of the several concepts that will be discussed  class demonstrations and films videos will be regularly presented in class  It is hoped that at the conclusion of the course  the successful student should  Understand social psychological concepts and principles communicated in required course materials and lectures   e g  identify major theories  define theoretical terms  state conclusions drawn from the experiments described  link experiments to theory  etc  Understand social psychological research methods  evidenced in the ability to define research terms and concepts  distinguish between research approaches  distinguish between causal and noncausal relations  curiously question causes of human behavior  and value the role of scientific inquiry in his or her life  Apply social psychological theory to new situations  Identify the operation of psychological processes in everyday life  as well as the appropriateness of theories to new situations  Judge the value of social psychological research  Appraise the ethics the ethics of research studies  judge the  often hidden  value basis of conducting research  Evaluation  Evaluations will be based on five tests  one test after every two chapter interval  There will also be a mid term examination  Because in class demonstrations and discussions form an essential and integral part of the learning process  it is critical that every member of the class be actively involved in this aspect of the course  As evidence of class participation  students will be required to submit one illustration  see below of a topic discussed in the previous chapter  These illustrations will be due on the day of class following the completion of a preceding chapter  The aim is to enable students apply the course material to other events in everyday life  literature  etc  You should include information on the theme that is being illustrated underneath the title of the illustration  You should also give fairly detailed accounts of the events which may be drawn from a journal  newspaper  magazine  or web site  the information should be properly referenced  should include information on source  date  volume  issue number  page s  URL  etc  Be sure to attach a copy of the material used in the illustration  The illustrations will not be returned  therefore if you wish to keep a copy for your records  ensure that you submit a high quality copy of the items you wish to retain  Students will be awarded marks for class participation  which will be based mainly  but not exclusively  on the illustrations  Given the elaborate nature of this participation process  10  of the total course score will be allotted to class participation  The distribution of the evaluation is as follows  Tests   35  Mid term Exam   25  Final Exam   30  Participation   10  Total   100  The letter grades  based on standard percentages  are computed as follows  A   90  and above B   80 89  C   70 79  D   60 69  F   59  and below In all matters relating to evaluation  cadets have to be guided by the Institute regulations regarding work that has been submitted in consideration for a grade  The appropriate section most pertinent to this course is attached below  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for a successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feelings about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse

Institute regulations regarding work that has been submitted in consideration for a grade  The appropriate section most pertinent to this course is attached below  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for a successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feelings about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  Chapter Outlines Notes Introduction to Social Psychology  Chapter 1  Methodology  The Process of Doing Research  Chapter 2  Social Cognition  How We
