lives  Buildings to save lives  April 30  2014 in Academic  Cadets  Stories  by Kate Donnie Martin  13 isn t looking to save the world   but he d surely like to know that he s saved a few lives  Martin  a civil engineering major with an international background  did his senior honors thesis on the use of ferrocement  a type of reinforced concrete  to retrofit existing buildings so they will bend rather than break under the stress of an earthquake  He hopes to see this technique used in the slum areas of developing countries  In those countries  earthquakes typically cause great loss of life because buildings collapse upon those inside  Martin grew up overseas because his father was involved in missionary work  He and his family were living in Cyprus when a major earthquake struck Turkey in 1999  killing over 17 000 people  Both of Martin s parents were involved in the relief efforts  At VMI  Martin began to think about how to cheaply reinforce buildings so they could withstand stress better  When he researched ferrocement  he found that it had been used as a stand alone building material for over 100 years  but never as an add on  Working in the civil engineering lab at VMI  Martin adhered cinder blocks together  added a layer of burlap or bamboo  and then a layer of ferrocement  When the blocks were shaken  the ferrocement cracked but did not break  Martin s interest in helping residents of the developing world has taken him far beyond the VMI post  In the summer of 2012  he helped to replace a water line in Bolivia on a trip led by the VMI chapter of Engineers Without Borders  Just one day after graduation  he headed back to help put in a second water line  After graduation  Martin plans to work in civil engineering research and then go to graduate school  with the goal of earning a professional engineer s license   The Institute Honors Program was a tremendous gift  To be given all of the tools to create this  present something  and put it all together
