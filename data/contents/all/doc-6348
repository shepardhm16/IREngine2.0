County  Virginia  area represents a compilation of data from a number of different sources  In 1957  J J  Murray  former pastor of Lexington Presbyterian Church and one of the founding members of the Virginia Society of Ornithology  published the Birds of Rockbridge County  Virginia as the first publication of Virginia Avifauna  VSO  His book presented species accounts or records for 245 species of birds  Of the 245 species  Murray noted that three were probable  he had no confirmation of their presence in the county  His data included personal observations  data from the Lexington Area Christmas Bird Count  and observations or evidence presented to him from other individuals  It is clear from Murray s work that Rockbridge County has a rich avifauna even though the county lacked marsh land and large bodies of water  Since the publication of Murray s book  there have been a number of changes in the area  Most notably  Lake Merriweather  Lake Robertson  and Willow Lake were created  the Interstate system was created  Cameron s Pond drained  and the amount of acreage being farmed has decreased while the amount of residential land has increased  The Birds of the Greater Rockbridge County Area represents an up date of Murray s book  To date  a total of 268 species have been recorded in the county  two of these species are listed as probable by Murray  It is worth noting that since the publication of Murray s book  Bewick s Wrens are no longer found in the area  House Finches are present  and there are confirmed records for Red throated Loon  Snow Bunting  Red necked Grebe  Barnacle Goose  Ross  Goose  Northern Goshawk  Wood Stork  Glossy Ibis  Fork tailed Flycatcher  Clay colored Sparrow  Brewster s Warbler  Orange crowned Warbler  White Ibis  Rufous Hummingbird  Mute Swan  Willow Flycatcher  Dickcissel  Sandhill Crane  Surf Scoter  White winged Crossbill  Cackling Goose  Northern Shrike  and Cattle Egret  The information presented in the Birds of the Greater Rockbridge County Area is drawn from the current database of observations  a summary of the Christmas Bird Count data  and Murray s book  The current database includes observations from a number of local birders  Alex Merritt  George Tolley  Bob Paxton  Wendy Richards  Steve Richards  Kieran Kilday  Lucy Rowe  Dick Rowe  Barbara Rowe  Paul Cabe  Laura Neale  Chip Coalter  Barbara Coalter  John Burleson  Sarah Burleson  Barry Kinzie  John Pancake  Allen Larner and others  As a group we have been able to cover most of the county on a regular basis and thus provided nearly 15 years of reliable data  My work on the project was supported through the VMI Faculty Developmental Leave Program and the Jackson Hope Fund  Up dates   to see recent changes to the Birds of Rockbridge County or the Photo Gallery  Up dates  Photography  All photographs included in the book were taken by Dick Rowe  unless otherwise noted  Nearly all of the photographs were taken within the Greater Rockbridge County area  The photographs serve as documentation for a particular species in the area  and in addition  they are representative of the plumage or coloration that would be expected for a specific species in the county  The photo galleries are in flickr  To see the complete photo gallery for the Birds of the Greater Rockbridge County  Virginia  Area follow the link below  Flickr Photo
