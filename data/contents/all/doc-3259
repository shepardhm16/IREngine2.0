24450 Institute Report  October 2006 By Wendy Lovell Special Correspondent VMI s economics and business department initiated its internship program several years ago to help its majors gain valuable experience in the workplace  However  the cadets aren t the only ones who have benefited from the program   In seeking opportunities for our cadets  I ve talked to many alumni who not only are willing to provide internships but also want to return to Post to share their insights on the business world  said Linda Moreschi  program coordinator   The response from employers has been really positive  and the alumni who participated have a renewed interest in our department  Thanks to funding from a Jackson Hope Grant  Moreschi staffs the program on a part time basis  seeking internship opportunities and assisting cadets in the application process   Our goal is to place 10 cadets in internships each summer  but in 2006  we facilitated 18  said Moreschi  who often draws on her background in sales   Much of my job requires selling alumni and businesses on providing opportunities for our students  VMI loyalty is strong  and I ve found many alumni who really want to help give them the experience they need to succeed in the future  Col  Floyd H  Duncan  64  professor and head of the economics and business department  sees the internship program as a win for everyone involved  The cadets get valuable experience  employers find their interns hard working and helpful  and the department enjoys the connection to business leaders  In addition  the economics and business department has a successful program to support its efforts to attain accreditation by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business  AACSB  Duncan added that successful internships have translated into permanent placements for several graduates who participated in the internship program  Currently no credit is offered  but the department hopes to generate the resources and structure to make it a four credit program as soon as next summer   I tell our students I want them to have a powerful experience but also to make a powerful impression  said Duncan   These internships are not only a terrific opportunity for our cadets to gain experience but also for the employers who get to see what they can do firsthand  Bob Copty  70 of Copty   Company  a commercial real estate firm in Roanoke  found that to be the case when he hosted an intern for the first time last summer  Cadet Jake Willis  07 assisted with the firm s marketing efforts   Jake is a very good worker and a self starter  and he helped with projects we found hard to accomplish in house  said Copty   As an alumnus  I like the idea of being supportive of VMI students  We hear and read so much about U Va  and VPI kids and the great education they receive  VMI students do measure up  but we don t get the press  It is one thing to see how well they march but a different experience to have them work with your company  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination
