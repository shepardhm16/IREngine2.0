 Astrophotography Astrophotography Research requires telescope parameters that produce good numbers  For example  CCD electronic imaging is superb for quantitative measurements of the colors and

photography is simple and can produce excellent results  Reflectors vs  Refractors Refracting telescopes use a large lens to form the image  and reflecting telescopes use a curved mirror  Which one is preferable for astrophotography  There are several factors to consider  and we have summarized the advantages of reflectors vs  refractors for astrophotography  The VMI Apochromatic Refractor We are fortunate to have an excellent refractor which is optimized for astrophotography  The Astrophysics Model 130 5 inch refractor  made by Astro Physics  Inc  is an apochromatic refractor  which is an optical design which goes one step further than the achromatic lenses to correct for chromatic aberration  the natural occurrence of blue light coming to a focus at a shorter distance than the longer wavelengths  The resulting images with this type of lens are sharper than for any other refractor optical designs  Learn more about Astro Physics  Inc  We mounted the 5 inch refractor on the VMI 20 inch reflector  so that the large telescope acts as a tracking platform for the refractor  The focal ratio is f 7  with a tube length of 35 inches  It produces superb images for visual observations and we often use a 17mm eyepiece  for a magnification of about 50 power  perfect for nebulae and galaxies  We pick up a guide star on the 20 inch telescope and can then make small corrections to the tracking  For astrophotography  we use a field flattener lens  which changes the f ratio to f 6 and gives tack sharp images out to the edge of the field  The refractor accommodates a 35mm camera  but we prefer the medium format Pentax 6x7  with the larger 120 film size  This view shows the 20 inch reflector from the northeast  with the two refractors  The black tube refractor  on the right  is the finder telescope  generally not used  because the computer pointing of the 20 inch is so accurate  The Astrophysics photographic refractor is on the left  white tube with two black mounting rings

Astrophotography Research requires telescope parameters that produce good numbers  For example  CCD electronic imaging is superb for quantitative measurements of the colors and brightness of stars  For wide field imaging  film based photography is sometimes better  because of the size of the image  For students who may not have time to learn the intricacies of CCD imaging  photography is simple and can produce excellent results  Reflectors vs  Refractors Refracting telescopes use a large lens to form the image  and reflecting telescopes use a curved mirror  Which one is preferable for astrophotography  There are several factors to consider  and we have summarized the advantages of reflectors vs  refractors for astrophotography  The VMI Apochromatic Refractor We are fortunate to have an excellent refractor which is optimized for astrophotography  The Astrophysics Model 130 5 inch refractor  made by Astro Physics  Inc  is an apochromatic refractor  which is an optical design which goes one step further than the achromatic lenses to correct for chromatic aberration  the natural occurrence of blue light coming to a focus at a shorter distance than the longer wavelengths  The resulting images with this type of lens are sharper than for any other refractor optical designs  Learn more about Astro Physics  Inc  We mounted the 5 inch refractor on the VMI 20 inch reflector  so that the large telescope acts as a tracking platform for the refractor  The focal ratio is f 7  with a tube length of 35 inches  It produces superb images for visual observations and we often use a 17mm eyepiece  for a magnification of about 50 power  perfect for nebulae and galaxies  We pick up a guide star on the 20 inch telescope and can then make small corrections to the tracking  For astrophotography  we use a field flattener lens  which changes the f ratio to f 6 and gives tack sharp images out to the edge of the field  The refractor accommodates a 35mm camera  but we prefer the medium format Pentax 6x7  with the larger 120 film size  This view shows the 20 inch reflector from the northeast  with the two refractors  The black tube refractor  on the right  is the finder telescope  generally not used  because the computer pointing of the 20 inch is so accurate  The Astrophysics photographic refractor is on the left  white tube with two black mounting rings  Here the eyepiece has been replaced with a camera adaptor for the Pentax 6x7 medium format camera  Orion Nebula Images Home   Academics   Areas of Study   Science   Math   Physics   Astronomy
