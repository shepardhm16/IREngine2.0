HELP 2015 2016 Academic Catalogue Biology  B A  Print Degree Planner   Print Friendly Page The mission of the VMI biology department is to broadly train students to understand how living organisms function and to appreciate the intricacies and interactions that govern all living systems   This mission supports the broader VMI mission of creating citizen soldiers  by equipping students to make informed decisions that will better society  We accomplish this by providing students with broad training and fundamental background in the biological sciences  while providing the opportunity to specialize in the sub disciplines described under  Academic Concentrations in Biology  Also  we offer in collaboration with the Physical Education Department an Exercise Science minor  The degree programs are particularly good at preparing majors to pursue post graduate education in the biological and health sciences and allow for specialization that matches student interests and career plans   Faculty members believe that interaction with cadets in the classroom  laboratory  and on an individual basis is critical in the development of the successful biology major  In keeping with this philosophy  class sizes are small  laboratories accompany most courses  advising is conducted on an individual basis  and undergraduate research is encouraged  The biology department also provides a summer research experience  The Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program is an intensive ten week program that introduces selected students to the scientific method  research design and data analysis  data presentation  use of sophisticated laboratory instruments  and independent research  Each student conducts a research project under the guidance of a faculty mentor  This research is at the  cutting edge  of science  and student faculty publications have resulted from these projects  Normally  cadets are selected to participate in this program between their second and first class years  Many additional opportunities for undergraduate research exists  allowing students to engage in a one on one interaction with a faculty mentor in their area of interest as early as the summer following the fourth class  freshman  year  B A  Curriculum Common Core Course Requirements The B A  curriculum is designed for those majors who require greater flexibility in their degree requirements  including pursuit of minors in other departments  All B A  biology majors are required to complete the following courses  BI 101   General Biology I Credit Hours  4 BI 102   General Biology II Credit Hours  4 BI 103   Biological Diversity and Systematics I Credit Hours  2 BI 104   Biological Diversity and Systematics II Credit Hours  2 BI 205   Genetics Credit Hours  4 BI Capstone   Capstone Experience Credit Hours  3 Core Area Pairings In addition to these courses  a B A  major must select one course from each of the following core area pairings  Organismal Biology BI

Biology Credit Hours  3   Additional Hours Additional hours  10  must be selected from any area within the biology curriculum except for research hours to total a minimum of 43 hours in biology  In addition to the biology courses  B A  majors must complete Quantitative Analysis I and II  MA 125  and MA 126  and show proficiency in a foreign language through the 200 level  Cadets in the B A  major must complete either two semesters of organic chemistry with lab  CH 223  and CH 229 CH 224  and CH 230  or general physics I and II  PY 120  and PY 115 PY 121  and PY 116  To broaden the education  six credits of any English  rhetoric  and humanistic studies  ERH  courses above the 100 level are required  Additionally  12 non science elective  LA  credits must be completed in either English  rhetoric  and humanistic studies  ERH  history  economics  business  psychology  political science  or modern languages  The remainder  9  of the 136 hours required for graduation can be taken from any department on Post  Cadets completing the B A  degree often complete double majors or minors in other disciplines  A minor in chemistry can be completed by taking one additional course from selected courses in the chemistry curriculum  The requirements for minors in psychology  history or English  rhetoric and humanistic studies areas  for example  fit in well with our elective requirements  Additional Core Curriculum Requirements All B S  and B A  biology majors are also required to satisfy four additional Core Curriculum requirements  Two writing intensive courses must be taken with one in the biology major  Two Civilizations and Cultures courses  6 credits  PS 344   Leadership in Organizations   ERH 103   Fundamentals of Public Speaking   Minor in Exercise Science The Minor in Exercise Science is designed to provide cadets with a comprehensive introduction to the foundations of exercise and fitness  This interdisciplinary minor can be declared through the department of biology or the department of physical education  Exercise Science Minor  Synopsis of the B A  Curriculum in Biology Fourth  Freshman  Class First Semester BI 101   General Biology I
