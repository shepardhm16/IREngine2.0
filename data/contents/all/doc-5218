Mercardante  right  congratulates 2nd Lt  William E  Harley upon his commissioning last May as a second lieutenant in the U S  Marine Corps   VMI photo by Kevin Remington    Mercardante  35  was acting sergeant major for Combat Logistics Battalion 24 of the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit when he died While at VMI  Mercardante was an assistant Marine officer instructor  or MOI  and helped train cadets preparing to be commissioned as officers in the Marine Corps   As an assistant MOI  First Sergeant Mercardante was a superb Marine and a tremendous role model for all of us  said Col  William Grace  commanding officer of the VMI Naval ROTC unit   He loved being a Marine and helping develop our next generation of leaders  He was totally devoted to our cadets while at VMI and to his Marines while leading them in our nation s effort in War on Terror  He will be missed  Mercardante s impact on training cadets was so appreciated by the VMI Class of 2007 that the class selected him as an Honorary Brother Rat  The first year cadets attend VMI they are known as Rats  and the shared experience of that demanding time forges bonds among them that last a lifetime  Members of the class call one another  Brother Rat  and the selection of a faculty or staff member to join that brotherhood is the highest honor a class can bestow  Jamaal Walton  president of the Class of 2007  said the class member extend their condolences to the Mercardante family   First Sergeant Mercardante was chosen as an Honorary Brother Rat for our class because he was man of honor  integrity  and always went above the expectations of his duty  Walton said   He always lent a helping hand to others and made a positive impact to those who got to know him  Brother Rat Mercardante was truly a great Marine  a great friend  and most of all a great father  Sally Coffman Arciero  the class agent for the Class of 2007  said the class was the first that Mercardante saw matriculate and that  he grew into VMI along with us  Though his primary duties put him into close contact with those cadets involved in Naval ROTC  he made a special effort to meet all members of the class  she said   I saw him making an effort to talk with and get to know all of us  Arciero said   It was a much appreciated effort  I found him to be an intense man  and he supported that which he believed in with his entire being  He was an honorable man  a good leader  and a proud Brother Rat  In responding to his selection for the honor with a letter that was published in the Bomb  the VMI yearbook  Mercardante said   Your class and this great institution has also played a significant role in my life and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to be associated with such a prestigious  honorable  and respectable organization  From the day you matriculated   I developed a sense of respect and admiration for each of you and those who wear the VMI uniform  He said he was impressed as the members of the class developed over their cadetships   Keeping with the spirit of the Brother Rat  he said   I will represent you and your class at all times in the most professional and respectable manner  be an ambassador for VMI  be an individual that any of you can call upon at any time  and wear your class ring with great pride  This is one of the greatest honors of my life after being able to call myself a Christian  a father  and a United States Marine  Funeral arrangements are pending  Read an account in the Athens  Gs  Banner Herald     VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title
