to talk with and get to know all of us  Arciero said   It was a much appreciated effort  I found him to be an intense man  and he supported that which he believed in with his entire being  He was an honorable man  a good leader  and a proud Brother Rat  In responding to his selection for the honor with a letter that was published in the Bomb  the VMI yearbook  Mercardante said   Your class and this great institution has also played a significant role in my life and I am truly grateful for the opportunity to be associated with such a prestigious  honorable  and respectable organization  From the day you matriculated   I developed a sense of respect and admiration for each of you and those who wear the VMI uniform  He said he was impressed as the members of the class developed over their
