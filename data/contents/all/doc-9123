limit will be asked to provide evidence of their level of conditioning  Prospective cadets should review these requirements and ensure they are in compliance  The weight standards will also be reviewed during the medical evaluation process for students who have been conditionally appointed  Applicants who are not in compliance may be denied entry to VMI  General Order 49  VMI Height Weight and Body Fat Assessment Program General Order 31  VMI Fitness Testing Program VMI Fitness Test Fitness at VMI is further measured by the VMI Fitness Test  VFT  which is administered twice each

the VFT  ROTC Branch Requirements VMI cadets are also expected to meet ROTC specific requirements  Each service conducts two or more service specific fitness tests each year   Additionally  the
