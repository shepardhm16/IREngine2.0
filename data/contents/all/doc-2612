Cadet Leadership VMI is about developing leaders  From its beginning  the Institute has been organized to present challenges and opportunities that draw leadership from cadets  Cadets take the lead in important elements of the Institute   the Corps of Cadets  the Honor Court  the Class System  and in the various ROTC units  The manner in which these elements interrelate creates the VMI s unique system of leadership development  Regimental System The Cadet Regiment is designed to provide the discipline of a military structure for the Institute s student body  The Corps is accountable to the commandant  however  cadets provide the leadership to operate the Corps on a day to day basis and to accomplish long term goals  This distinctive military organization is tremendous leadership training institution in its own right  Many renowned military officers have emerged from its ranks  as have leaders in business  government and society  Preeminent among these is George C  Marshall  who served as Cadet First Captain   or commander of the regiment   in 1901 and went on to lead America s military to victory in World War II  served as secretary of state  and secretary of defense  Organized as an infantry unit  the Regiment consists of two battalions of five companies each  Cadets earn leadership positions  All officers are 1st Class cadets  all sergeants are 2nd Class cadets  and all corporals are 3rd Class cadets  Class System The class system is a uniquely VMI manifestation of a student government system  The Class System  consisting of the General Committee  the Executive Committee  the Officer of the Guard Association  and the Rat Disciplinary Committee  has far greater responsibilities than student government systems at other colleges  The General Committee One of the three major agencies of student government is the General Committee  composed of officers of the three upper classes  elected by their classmates and a secretary chosen by the 1st class officers  This body enforces rules that govern the conduct of the Corps and grants increasing privileges to classes as they advance in seniority  The administration recognizes the General Committee and class officers as official representatives of the Corps and their separate classes  and it extends to them wide authority in self government  White Book   Cadet Government Procedures Honor System The heart of VMI s student government is the honor system  Although honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  it clearly refers to relationships which govern society and which yield to the members of that society immediate and tangible benefits  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  stealing  or tolerating those who do are considered violations of the Honor Code  A cadet s statement in any controversy is accepted without question as truthful  examinations are not proctored  the word  certified  on a paper means that the work is the cadet s own and that the cadet has neither given nor received help  The Corps as a whole has always been the guardian of its own honor  and its honor is its most cherished possession  To administer the system  the Corps elects an Honor Court  Any suspected violation is reported to this Honor Court  which conducts an investigation of the circumstances  An accused cadet may admit guilt and leave the Institute or may request trial  If found guilty  the cadet is dishonorably dismissed  If the accused is acquitted  the case is closed  and all records pertaining to the case are destroyed  VMI Fitness Test VMI Fitness Testing Program is under the supervision of the Commandant s Office  Its objective is to achieve and maintain a standard of physical strength and endurance which will ensure a well conditioned cadet corps  All cadets are required to take the VFT each semester  Using the links to the right  this10 week training program to help prepare you for the VMI Physical Fitness Test  VFT  This is a general program intended to be used as a guideline  You may need to make adjustments with regard to the intensity  duration  and frequency of training based on your individual fitness level Prior to any exercise session it is recommended that you warm up properly and perform a full body stretching routine  Consult your physical education teacher if you have any questions with regard to a stretching program  It is recommended that you train all of the testing components on the same day and in the order that they are administered  pull ups  sit ups  and 2 400 meters  However  if time is a factor and you cannot train all components on the same day  then do them on separate days  It is important that each fitness component is trained three days per week on a consistent basis  Furthermore  it is recommended that you periodically pick a day  preferably a Saturday or Sunday  and give yourself the fitness test to evaluate your progress  Push ups are not part of the fitness test  however  they are required as part of training for the Rat Line  You can perform the push ups on
