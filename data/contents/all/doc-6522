program took a cadet to Virginia Commonwealth University as part of a new cooperative program  Physics major Jacob Tharp  12 joined a project of Dr  Ross Anderson  associate professor of mechanical engineering at VCU  to develop a nuclear reactor simulator  The simulator  which mimics the control room at the North Anna nuclear power station  has been a VCU senior design project for two years  coming together as individual students completed their portions of the work  This summer I ve been looking at the whole thing  trying to fix issues  said Tharp   looking at equations  Tharp s project was one of three in a new program of VMI s Department of Mechanical Engineering  the VMI VCU Summer Undergraduate Research Program  under which VMI and Virginia Commonwealth University jointly fund summer research projects at VCU for up to five cadets   I see this program as really broadening the undergraduate research opportunities for our cadets  said Col  Jon Michael Hardin  head of VMI s mechanical engineering department  The two other cadets who completed SURI projects at VCU are Michael Everett  12  who worked with Maj  Ryan Taylor at VMI and Dr  Worth Longest  VCU Qimonda Associate Professor of mechanical engineering  on  Development of Dry Powder Inhalers for Enhanced Lung Delivery  and Gabriel Dongieux  12  whose project with Col  Tim Hodges at VMI and Dr  Karla Mossi  VCU associate professor of mechanical engineering  resulted in a patent application for a piezoelectric viscometer for measuring blood viscosity  Hardin got the ball rolling for the two mechanical engineering majors when they and 14 others visited VCU last fall  The cadets met with VCU graduate students and heard them talk about their research projects   I wanted them to see beyond graduation    to see the larger world and what was out there for them  said Hardin  pointing to the second part of this initiative  which is guaranteed placing for a certain number of qualified VMI graduates in any graduate programs offered by VCU s School of Engineering  Though the summer program offers new opportunities to cadets  it also allows cadets to share their skills with VCU students  Tharp found he had a distinct advantage because  unlike some of the other students working on the simulator  he had already spent a semester at VMI working with the LabView graphical development environment in one of his physics classes   It shows that VMI is very cognizant that we need to make sure we re using software that is industry standard or the most current  said Hardin   These are some high expense items  It really reflects well on VMI that our kids go out knowing how to use this current software  In his SURI project  Tharp has worked to resolve problems in the simulator and to identify areas that might be improved through future student projects  He feels some satisfaction in that he has spent this summer troubleshooting a system that allows future nuclear reactor operators to practice responding to problems without incident   Everything I do is helping out  he said   It s giving him a lot of exposure to the nuclear power business  to how a reactor behaves  said Tharp s VMI SURI adviser  Capt  Bob McMasters professor of mechanical engineering  To meet requirements of the new program  Tharp sent weekly progress reports to McMasters  Tharp has been accepted into the U S  Navy nuclear power program  slotted for submarines  and will attend Officer Candidate School after graduation in the spring and then head to Nuclear Propulsion School in Charleston  S C  In the interim  he hopes to further pursue this topic in an Institute Honors thesis  This fall  Hardin plans to have Tharp  Dongieux  and Everett present their work to 2nd Class cadets who will also visit VCU and have the opportunity to participate in the program next summer  By  Sherri Tombarge IR   Aug  2011 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT
