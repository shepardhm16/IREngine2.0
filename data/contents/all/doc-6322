zebrafish  We have established a zebrafish breeding colony  which we will use as our experimental animal model  The zebrafish just got a big splash in  Science Magazine  because it is one of the premier animals to be used in genomics and molecular biology  This is because of its rapid development as an embryo and its transparent mature which makes it ideal for analyzing treatments of various types or gene alterations whose effects can be visually recognized in these animals  Figure 1  Normally developing zebrafish with control ERS treatment  The zebrafish has normally developing eyes  E  and a small cardiac sac  CS  which is not enlarged  as well as a straight body  There are no physical abnormalities apparent  After one to two days  full sensory motor function would be displayed  Trophic factors in the development and recovery of the damaged nervous and cardiovascular systems  I have been fortunate during my research career to have pioneered a new field in the visual sciences  retinal transplantation  which now has its own section at national and international vision meetings  I have also been pleased to see my biomedical findings translated into clinical research in this area  I have been awarded over  3 5 million in grant funding to support this work from public  private  and industrial sources and published over 100 scientific papers  Figure 2  Photomicrograph depicting the immunohistochemical visualization of znp 1 stained CaP and MiP primary motor neurons at 96 hours post fertilization in the zebrafish trunk muscles  We are interested in the effects of various trophic protective drugs in the mutant strains of zebrafish that mimic human brain and cardiovascular disease conditions such as macular degeneration and Alzheimer s disease  Our ultimate goal is to screen potential drugs for their ability to successively treat brain and cardiovascular disorders and to understand their mechanisms of action at the molecular  biochemical and cellular levels  We will be using histological  immunocytochemical  biochemical and molecular biological techniques to help answer some of these questions  Figure 3  Confocal microscopic observations depicting the

of Study   Natural Science   Mathematics   Biology   Research   James Turner Research Working with zebrafish  We have established a zebrafish breeding colony  which we will use as our experimental animal model  The zebrafish just got a big splash in  Science Magazine  because it is one of the premier animals to be used in genomics and molecular biology  This is because of its rapid development as an embryo and its transparent mature which makes it ideal for analyzing treatments of various types or gene alterations whose effects can be visually recognized in these animals  Figure 1  Normally developing zebrafish with control ERS treatment  The zebrafish has normally developing eyes  E  and a small cardiac sac  CS  which is not enlarged  as well as a straight body  There are no physical abnormalities apparent  After one to two days  full sensory motor function would be displayed  Trophic factors in the development and recovery of the damaged nervous and cardiovascular systems  I have been fortunate during my research career to have pioneered a new field in the visual sciences  retinal transplantation  which now has its own section at national and international vision meetings  I have also been pleased to see my biomedical findings translated into clinical research in this area  I have been awarded over  3 5 million in grant funding to support this work from public  private  and industrial sources and published over 100 scientific papers  Figure 2  Photomicrograph depicting the immunohistochemical visualization of znp 1 stained CaP and MiP primary motor neurons at 96 hours post fertilization in the zebrafish trunk muscles  We are interested in the effects of various trophic protective drugs in the mutant strains of zebrafish that mimic human brain and cardiovascular disease conditions such as macular degeneration and Alzheimer s disease  Our ultimate goal is to screen potential drugs for their ability to successively treat brain and cardiovascular disorders and to understand their mechanisms of action at the molecular  biochemical and cellular levels  We will be using histological  immunocytochemical  biochemical and molecular biological techniques to help answer some of these questions  Figure 3  Confocal microscopic observations depicting the posterior trunk blood vascular supply in the developing transgenic  TG fil1 EGFP  y1 y1  AB
