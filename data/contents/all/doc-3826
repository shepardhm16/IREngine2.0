Accommodations Letter form  an Accommodation Agreement form  and an Authorization to Exchange Information form  The Request for Accommodations form and the Accommodation Agreement form initiate your request to receive accommodations in selected courses  The Authorization to Exchange Information form allows ODS to exchange information with designated professionals to make final determinations of whether appropriate and reasonable accommodations are warranted and can be provided to the cadet  In most cases  the Institute assigns authority to the Director of the Office of Disabilities Services to determine reasonable and appropriate accommodations based on the documentation provided  In the event there are issues or concerns involving accommodations  the Director reserves the right to consult with the Dean and faculty members before providing accommodations  Once documentation has been reviewed and accommodations have been granted by the Director  cadets will receive an Accommodations Letter  This letter will serve as the cadet s documentation of a registered disability and will be used as documentation and notification of the cadet s disability with professors  After picking up the Accommodations Letter from the ODS  cadets must make an appointment during office hours with each professor to deliver the Accommodation Letter and discuss specific accommodation needs  It is very important that cadets do not try to give professors the Accommodation Letter before or after class  When meeting with professors  cadets should discuss their strengths and weaknesses and how they think the accommodations will help them in the classroom  Cadets do not have to disclose what their disability is  however  this disclosure often opens the door for professors to ask questions and for cadets to educate their professors about a particular disability  Cadets must ensure that they have each professor sign and date their Accommodations Letter  The signed letter serves as the documentation indicating that the cadet has met their responsibility to inform the professor of their eligibility for accommodations  Each professor will copy the signed Accommodation Letter and retain the copy in a confidential file in their office  A request for extra time on a test should be discussed with the professor before the test or exam is scheduled  This allows the professor enough time to make appropriate adjustments to his or her schedule  Please note that last minute requests for accommodations as well as failure to meet with a professor in a timely manner will result

Col  Sarah Jones        8 00 am 4 30 pm Monday Friday  Accommodation Procedures NOTE  Accommodation letters must be requested EACH SEMESTER through the ODS  Cadets with disabilities who wish accommodations must first meet with the Director of Disabilities Services for an initial interview and provide copies of their documentation of a disability  Cadets will complete a Request for Accommodations Letter form  an Accommodation Agreement form  and an Authorization to Exchange Information form  The Request for Accommodations form and the Accommodation Agreement form initiate your request to receive accommodations in selected courses  The Authorization to Exchange Information form allows ODS to exchange information with designated professionals to make final determinations of whether appropriate and reasonable accommodations are warranted and can be provided to the cadet  In most cases  the Institute assigns authority to the Director of the Office of Disabilities Services to determine reasonable and appropriate accommodations based on the documentation provided  In the event there are issues or concerns involving accommodations  the Director reserves the right to consult with the Dean and faculty members before providing accommodations  Once documentation has been reviewed and accommodations have been granted by the Director  cadets will receive an Accommodations Letter  This letter will serve as the cadet s documentation of a registered disability and will be used as documentation and notification of the cadet s disability with professors  After picking up the Accommodations Letter from the ODS  cadets must make an appointment during office hours with each professor to deliver the Accommodation Letter and discuss specific accommodation needs  It is very important that cadets do not try to give professors the Accommodation Letter before or after class  When meeting with professors  cadets should discuss their strengths and weaknesses and how they think the accommodations will help them in the classroom  Cadets do not have to disclose what their disability is  however  this disclosure often opens the door for professors to ask questions and for cadets to educate their professors about a particular disability  Cadets must ensure that they have each professor sign and date their Accommodations Letter  The signed letter serves as the documentation indicating that the cadet has met their responsibility to inform the professor of their eligibility for accommodations  Each professor will copy the signed Accommodation Letter and retain the copy in a confidential file in their office  A request for extra time on a test should be discussed with the professor before the test or exam is scheduled  This allows the professor enough time to make appropriate adjustments to his or her schedule  Please note that last minute requests for accommodations as well as failure to meet with a professor in a timely manner will result in a delay in provision of requested accommodations      Accommodation Procedures NOTE  Accommodation letters must be requested EACH SEMESTER through the ODS  Cadets with disabilities who wish
