Diamond Hill  empty for so long and so out of place adjacent to the VMI post  is gone  But it is not forgotten  Thanks to the efforts of Whiting Turner Contracting Co  Ace House Movers  and  of course  VMI  the Knights of Pythias building  which was erected in the mid 1920s and carries a historical significance for so many in the Lexington community  has found a new home  The building was moved about 100 yards south during a Herculean relocation effort that involved a massive amount of manpower and heavy equipment and attracted a throng of interested spectators who watched with anticipation as the building inched its way up Main Street   It s a very detailed process that involved a lot of different folks  from our engineers and our architects to the contractors and the decision makers here at VMI  to ensure that the project is exactly what we want it to be and that the structure gets moved to the right location  said Col  Keith Jarvis  82  deputy director of construction at VMI  The move was made to make room for the Indoor Training Facility  which will house a state of the art NCAA track and other  obstacle venues  as Jarvis called them  that will benefit the entire Corps of Cadets  Construction of the Indoor Training Facility is part of the first phase of  122 million two phase Corps Physical Training Facility project that also includes renovation of Cormack Hall and Cocke Hall   The  Knights of Pythias  building sat literally in the footprint of the Corps Physical Training Facility  Jarvis explained   The building had to be moved in order for the new structure to fit within that space  Moving the building was not easy  The old building is 4 000 square feet and  according to estimates  weighs in at 350 tons  Though engineers assured those planning the move of the structure s stability  there was obviously some concern about moving a building that size down Main Street  even if the move was only 100 yards  The professional movers jacked up the building and set it on a series of wheeled trailers  Each of those wheels was connected to a diesel engine and was operated remotely as the building eased its way to its new home   The operator  can articulate and move each of the wheels individually as he needs to in order to keep the building as stable as possible  Jarvis said  But once the building is on its new foundation  the work will not stop there  Government regulations require VMI to  mothball  the house  or  stabilize the structure in accordance with the standards that are specified by the  U S  Department of the Interior  said Jarvis  VMI will replace the entire roof  which was damaged some years ago  The construction department will also insert louvers in the new foundation to allow air to circulate to ensure no further damage will occur   Essentially  what we have is what we call a dark  cold building  said Jarvis   It will stay that way until VMI  which owns the building  decides  what to do with it  in the future  Sometime within the next month the building will be in its new location  fully stabilized  The entire process  including the move and stabilization  cost approximately  800 000  Preliminary work for the new

LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  10  2014   That old gray building  the one that sat at the foot of Diamond Hill  empty for so long and so out of place adjacent to the VMI post  is gone  But it is not forgotten  Thanks to the efforts of Whiting Turner Contracting Co  Ace House Movers  and  of course  VMI  the Knights of Pythias building  which was erected in the mid 1920s and carries a historical significance for so many in the Lexington community  has found a new home  The building was moved about 100 yards south during a Herculean relocation effort that involved a massive amount of manpower and heavy equipment and attracted a throng of interested spectators who watched with anticipation as the building inched its way up Main Street   It s a very detailed process that involved a lot of different folks  from our engineers and our architects to the contractors and the decision makers here at VMI  to ensure that the project is exactly what we want it to be and that the structure gets moved to the right location  said Col  Keith Jarvis  82  deputy director of construction at VMI  The move was made to make room for the Indoor Training Facility  which will house a state of the art NCAA track and other  obstacle venues  as Jarvis called them  that will benefit the entire Corps of Cadets  Construction of the Indoor Training Facility is part of the first phase of  122 million two phase Corps Physical Training Facility project that also includes renovation of Cormack Hall and Cocke Hall   The  Knights of Pythias  building sat literally in the footprint of the Corps Physical Training Facility  Jarvis explained   The building had to be moved in order for the new structure to fit within that space  Moving the building was not easy  The old building is 4 000 square feet and  according to estimates  weighs in at 350 tons  Though engineers assured those planning the move of the structure s stability  there was obviously some concern about moving a building that size down Main Street  even if the move was only 100 yards  The professional movers jacked up the building and set it on a series of wheeled trailers  Each of those wheels was connected to a diesel engine and was operated remotely as the building eased its way to its new home   The operator  can articulate and move each of the wheels individually as he needs to in order to keep the building as stable as possible  Jarvis said  But once the building is on its new foundation  the work will not stop there  Government regulations require VMI to  mothball  the house  or  stabilize the structure in accordance with the standards that are specified by the  U S  Department of the Interior  said Jarvis  VMI will replace the entire roof  which was damaged some years ago  The construction department will also insert louvers in the new foundation to allow air to circulate to ensure no further damage will occur   Essentially  what we have is what we call a dark  cold building  said Jarvis   It will stay that way until VMI  which owns the building  decides  what to do with it  in the future  Sometime within the next month the building will be in its new location  fully stabilized  The entire process  including the move and stabilization  cost approximately  800 000  Preliminary work for the new Corps Physical Training Facility is slated to begin Monday    Chris Floyd    VMI Communications
