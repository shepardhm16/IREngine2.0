500 Anderson Drive Lexington  VA  24450 About Environment Virginia Symposium For 26 years the Environment Virginia Symposium has been the commonwealth s premier environmental conference  An enduring strength of the symposium is broad stakeholder engagement at the highest levels  as evidenced by the annual participation of more than 600 leaders from the public and private sector to exchange information and technologies and build relationships to ensure a prosperous and sustainable future for all  Our upcoming conference will take place April 5 7  2016 at VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  one of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality s Virginia Green Convention and Conference Centers  Participants will be challenged to consider what we can jointly do to bring about better outcomes for our commonwealth than we could each accomplish individually  Examining the collaboration between different sectors to work  learn  and make connections together for the greater environmental good is particularly apropos in this anniversary year  The Environment Virginia Symposium is a cornerstone of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  programming  bringing on post leaders in various environmental fields and allowing cadets to interact with individuals representing different viewpoints on many pressing issues  By advancing state and national discussions of environmental concern  VMI continues the tradition of leadership that it seeks to instill in each member of the Corps of Cadets  To receive notifications of the next year s symposium  please email Derek Pinkham
