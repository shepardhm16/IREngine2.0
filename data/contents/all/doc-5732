March 6  2012   They re rich  They re famous  And they lie  They re young  Their futures are wide open  And they cheat  Investigative journalist James B  Stewart and Nassau County  N Y  District Attorney Kathleen Rice opened the second day of VMI s Leadership Conference with discussion of lying and cheating on a grand scale  Stewart has written about Martha Stewart  Major League baseball player Barry Bonds  Bush administration adviser Scooter Libby  and Ponzi scheme operator Bernie Madoff  They all have something in common  convictions for lying about their own illegal actions  Rice is prosecuting an SAT cheating scandal on Long Island  N Y  which  though it originated at Great Neck North High School  has proved to be indicative of a systemic  rather than a local problem   The consequences  said Stewart   are vast  He described how the rich  famous  powerful people he has written about lie because they are surrounded by people who never contradict them and because they think they are going to get away with it  But the willingness of lawyers  accountants  trainers  and friends to lie under oath could break the U S  system of justice   Our legal system is one big honor code  said Stewart   We ask citizens to take the witness stand   and then actually tell the truth  It s breathtaking when you think about it  It s nothing but a commitment to honesty  and it has worked for centuries  The cost of the lies is high  he said   It took almost 10 years to bring Bonds to trial because almost everyone in that case lied  It cost American taxpayers millions and millions of dollars   sucking resources that could have been devoted to more important cases  Noting that the alternative to the rule of law is law of the jungle  Stewart touched on an issue of particular interest to the cadets in the audience  the tension between loyalty to one s comrades   Brother Rats at VMI   and loyalty to one s values  In the cases he s seen  that  misguided  sense of loyalty runs only in one direction  from the poor to the rich  from the weak to the powerful  The powerful demand the truth as they see it  That s lying at the top  Rice has been investigating cheating at the bottom  in a case that started with school rumors heard by administrators who did the right thing  But once they had identified and punished the students who had paid college student Sam Eshaghoff to take the SAT for them  they had to turn to the district attorney s office for his prosecution  She surprised many when she made the hard choice to prosecute the students as well   I was criticized at the time  said Rice   They said  How can you prosecute these kids  It s not their fault  There s too much pressure at these schools  But Rice was looking at it another way   Without the students who paid him  you don t have a Sam Eshaghoff    We re beginning to see a culture of  What s the big deal  So they cheated  But Rice wanted to see real change  she wanted to see SAT and ACT testing made secure  So she expanded her investigation and soon found the cheating going on at other schools   Other kids paying  other Sam Eshaghoffs   Every single one of those kids who paid someone to take the SAT for them took a spot away from a kid who didn t pay someone  she explained   You have to have a level playing field  And though a level playing field with fair opportunities for all is important  Rice also sees greater implications   The bottom line in all of this is what kind of kids do we want to raise  What kind of people do we want as friends  What kind of colleagues do we want as we enter our professional life  Do you want to spend your life defending friends who are cheaters  Conference participants were called to consider where the beginning of the end of the problem should be   What can we do about it  Stewart had asked  answering   It has to start at the top  We have to have a commitment to honesty at the highest level  But a commitment to honesty at the highest level begins long before   If we as a society can t teach 16  17  and 18 year olds that cheating is wrong  and that cheating doesn t pay  what kind of society are we going to have  said Rice   At this young age  if we cannot teach kids that cheating doesn t pay  then you are looking at corrupt politicians  corrupt Wall Street executives  Echoing a sentiment expressed again and again by

Rice opened the second day of VMI s Leadership Conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson  The 500 seat Gillis Theater on the VMI post was filled to capacity with high school and college students and teachers from across the nation as VMI s second biennial Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  opened yesterday  The conference continues today  as the current generation of students takes the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity  LEXINGTON  Va  March 6  2012   They re rich  They re famous  And they lie  They re young  Their futures are wide open  And they cheat  Investigative journalist James B  Stewart and Nassau County  N Y  District Attorney Kathleen Rice opened the second day of VMI s Leadership Conference with discussion of lying and cheating on a grand scale  Stewart has written about Martha Stewart  Major League baseball player Barry Bonds  Bush administration adviser Scooter Libby  and Ponzi scheme operator Bernie Madoff  They all have something in common  convictions for lying about their own illegal actions  Rice is prosecuting an SAT cheating scandal on Long Island  N Y  which  though it originated at Great Neck North High School  has proved to be indicative of a systemic  rather than a local problem   The consequences  said Stewart   are vast  He described how the rich  famous  powerful people he has written about lie because they are surrounded by people who never contradict them and because they think they are going to get away with it  But the willingness of lawyers  accountants  trainers  and friends to lie under oath could break the U S  system of justice   Our legal system is one big honor code  said Stewart   We ask citizens to take the witness stand   and then actually tell the truth  It s breathtaking when you think about it  It s nothing but a commitment to honesty  and it has worked for centuries  The cost of the lies is high  he said   It took almost 10 years to bring Bonds to trial because almost everyone in that case lied  It cost American taxpayers millions and millions of dollars   sucking resources that could have been devoted to more important cases  Noting that the alternative to the rule of law is law of the jungle  Stewart touched on an issue of particular interest to the cadets in the audience  the tension between loyalty to one s comrades   Brother Rats at VMI   and loyalty to one s values  In the cases he s seen  that  misguided  sense of loyalty runs only in one direction  from the poor to the rich  from the weak to the powerful  The powerful demand the truth as they see it  That s lying at the top  Rice has been investigating cheating at the bottom  in a case that started with school rumors heard by administrators who did the right thing  But once they had identified and punished the students who had paid college student Sam Eshaghoff to take the SAT for them  they had to turn to the district attorney s office for his prosecution  She surprised many when she made the hard choice to prosecute the students as well   I was criticized at the time  said Rice   They said  How can you prosecute these kids  It s not their fault  There s too much pressure at these schools  But Rice was looking at it another way   Without the students who paid him  you don t have a Sam Eshaghoff    We re beginning to see a culture of  What s the big deal  So they cheated  But Rice wanted to see real change  she wanted to see SAT and ACT testing made secure  So she expanded her investigation and soon found the cheating going on at other schools   Other kids paying  other Sam Eshaghoffs   Every single one of those kids who paid someone to take the SAT for them took a spot away from a kid who didn t pay someone  she explained   You have to have a level playing field  And though a level playing field with fair opportunities for all is important  Rice also sees greater implications   The bottom line in all of this is what kind of kids do we want to raise  What kind of people do we want as friends  What kind of colleagues do we want as we enter our professional life  Do you want to spend your life defending friends who are cheaters  Conference participants were called to consider where the beginning of the end of the problem should be   What can we do about it  Stewart had asked  answering   It has to start at the top  We have to have a commitment to honesty at the highest level  But a commitment to honesty at the highest level begins long before   If we as a society can t teach 16  17  and 18 year olds that cheating is wrong  and that cheating doesn t pay  what kind of society are we going to have  said Rice   At this young age  if we cannot teach kids that cheating doesn t pay  then you are looking at corrupt politicians  corrupt Wall Street executives  Echoing a sentiment expressed again and again by conference speakers  Stewart said   It is time for each and everyone one of us to start stopping it today   Sherri Tombarge  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos
