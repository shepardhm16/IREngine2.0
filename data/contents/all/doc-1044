Basically  sexual harassment is when someone makes you think you ll get in trouble  lose your job  get a bad grade  or be denied a service unless you give in to sexual advances or put up with sexual remarks or actions  Sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination which is a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964  The U S  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission s  EEOC  guidelines define two types of sexual harassment   quid pro quo  and  hostile environment    What is  Quid Pro Quo  sexual harassment    What is  Quid Pro Quo  sexual harassment  Unwelcome sexual advances  requests for sexual favors  and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute  quid pro quo  sexual harassment when  1  submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual s employment or education or  2  submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as the basis for employment or academic decisions affecting the individual  What is  hostile environment  sexual harassment  What is  hostile environment  sexual harassment  Unwelcome sexual advances  requests for sexual favors  and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute  hostile environment  sexual harassment when such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual s work performance or education or creating an intimidating  hostile  or offensive working or educational environment  What factors determine whether an environment is  hostile  What factors determine whether an environment is  hostile  The central inquiry is whether the conduct  unreasonably interfered with an individual s work performance  or created  an intimidating  hostile  or offensive working environment  The inspector general will look at the following factors to determine whether an environment is hostile   1  whether the conduct was verbal or physical or both   2  how frequently it was repeated   3  whether the conduct was hostile or patently offensive   4  whether the alleged harasser was a co worker or supervisor   5  whether others joined in perpetrating the harassment  and  6  whether the harassment was directed at more than one individual  No one factor controls  An assessment is made based upon the totality of the circumstances  What is unwelcome sexual conduct   What is unwelcome sexual conduct  Sexual conduct becomes unlawful only when it is unwelcome  The challenged conduct must be unwelcome in the sense that the employee did not solicit or incite it and in the sense that the employee regarded the conduct as undesirable or offensive  How will the inspector general determine whether conduct is unwelcome  How will the inspector general determine whether conduct is unwelcome  When confronted with conflicting evidence as to whether conduct was welcome  the inspector general will look at the record as a whole and at the totality of the circumstances  evaluating each situation on a case by case basis  The investigation should determine whether the victim s conduct was consistent  or inconsistent  with his or her assertion that the sexual conduct was unwelcome  Who can be a victim of sexual harassment  Who can be a victim of sexual harassment  The victim may be a women or a man  The victim does not have to be of the opposite sex  The victim does not have to be the person harassed but could be anyone affected by the offensive conduct  Who can be a sexual harasser   Who can be a sexual harasser  The harasser may be a woman or a man  He or she can be the victim s supervisor  an agent of the employer  a supervisor in another area  a coworker  or a non employee  Can one incident constitute sexual harassment  Can one incident constitute sexual harassment  It depends  In  quid pro quo  cases  a single sexual advance may constitute harassment if it is linked to the granting or denial of employment or employment benefits  In contrast  unless the conduct is quite severe  a single incident or isolated incidents of offensive sexual conduct or remarks generally do not create a  hostile environment  A hostile environment claim usually requires a showing of a pattern of offensive conduct  However  a single  unusually severe incident of harassment may be sufficient to constitute a Title VII violation  the more severe the harassment  the less need to show a repetitive series of incidents  This is particularly true when the harassment is physical  For example  the inspector general will assume that the unwelcome  intentional touching of a charging party s intimate body areas is sufficiently offensive to alter the condition of his her working environment and constitute a violation of Title VII  Can verbal remarks constitute sexual harassment  Can verbal remarks constitute sexual harassment  Yes  The inspector general will evaluate the totality of the circumstances to ascertain the nature  frequency  context  and intended target of the remarks  Relevant factors may include   1  whether the remarks were hostile and derogatory   2  whether the alleged harasser singled out the charging party   3  whether the charging party participated in the exchange  and  4  the relationship between the charging party and the alleged harasser  What can you do  to avoid harassing others  What can you do  to avoid harassing others  Be conscious that your words  jokes  and comments of a sexual nature may hurt or offend others  Be sensitive that people of other cultures  the opposite sex  and your same sex may interpret your actions differently  Be proactive by not condoning or ignoring the harassing behavior of others  Ensure consent by asking for it and by understanding that  no  is often communicated in subtle ways  including verbally and through body language  Understand that sexual harassment is normally not a mutually agreed upon interaction between two consenting people such as mutual flirtation
