raised funds totaling close to  30 million and has provided over  7 million in grants in support of key academic initiatives  This support has been instrumental in many of the successes of VMI s academic program The Jackson Hope Fund Seeing the potential The support provided by the Jackson Hope Fund has been critical to developing new academic initiatives and cultivating those initiatives into flagship programs  such as the Undergraduate Research Initiative  The result has been a surge in our academic program that has helped us rise in several national rankings of colleges and universities  and we attribute this success in great part to the Jackson Hope Fund s benefactors  said VMI Superintendent Gen  J  H  Binford Peay III  62 In addition  the Jackson Hope Fund provides 75 percent of the funds the Institute commits to faculty development  and it has enabled us to continue hiring new teachers when most colleges and universities in the nation are cutting back With an endowment goal of  50 million  the Fund provides a unique source of support for especially promising academic initiatives that might otherwise languish in competition for the Institute s resources Named after the Jackson Hope Medal  the annual cadet award for the highest academic achievement  the Fund directly benefits cadets and faculty through innovative advancements in the academic program  guided by the goals and objectives set forth in VMI s Vision 2039 and the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools  SACS  Quality Enhancement Plan The Jackson Hope Fund is distinctive in that contributions are made with no specific purpose other than to support academics  and principal donors are actively involved in the process by approving the Institute s use of the funds and monitoring performance  Since its inception in 2001  the Fund has raised funds totaling close to  30 million and has provided over  7 million in grants in support of key academic initiatives  This support has been instrumental in many of the successes of VMI s academic program  initiatives  successes   VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni VMI
