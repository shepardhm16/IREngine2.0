was the sound  With the hundreds of people   new cadets  parents  faculty  and staff   seemingly all speaking at once  their collective voices became a low drone  like the buzzing of bees  and understanding what any one individual had to say was next to impossible  But one voice rang loud and clear  anonymously belting his invitation over the public address system  Matriculation by the Numbers Total  495 In State  302 Out of State  193 Males  442 Females      53 STEM Major  63 4  Liberal Arts Majors  36 6  States Represented      31 Foreign Countries      5   Now calling 131 140  131 140  Each new number set was the signal for new cadets falling in that range  their names  numbers  and companies spelled out on placards attached to their shirts  to head to the floor  Thus  the 495 new cadets got their first taste of VMI creating order out of chaos   It s nerve wracking  but it s also exciting  said Kayla Ranger  18  Company G s lead EMT  as she recalled her Matriculation Day   It gets really real  really fast   I remember standing right there at that Marine Corps table and getting scared out of my mind  added Connor Loken  17  the team lead EMT for Company I   It s weird because these guys don t know what s coming  At the bottom of the stairs  families were met by admissions office staff  and with the drone becoming louder as more and more people filed into the facility  new cadets weaved their way through a maze of important tables   the commandant s office  financial aid  the comptroller and  finally  the registrar  Now calling 141 150  141 150  It was at the registrar s table that reality hit  Oh  parents were proud  parading around the Cameron Hall floor with their newly purchased VMI garb  So were siblings  many of them prancing near the tables  red and yellow pom poms dancing along with them  But at this point  they were cordoned off from their new cadet  asked to stay behind the roped off area  at VMI but not quite a part of it  If there was separation anxiety  it hit there first   That was tough  saying good bye to    my parents  said Ranger   When they left  that was the last bit of home I had  You don t get home luxuries  here  Now calling 271 280  271 280  It all happened so fast  despite the wait in line to talk to ROTC officers or professors at tables laid out for the each of the majors offered at VMI  Soon  the new cadets made their way around the circuit and found themselves facing the Matriculation Book  To some  this is the most important tome on post  a book that has been signed by generations of new cadets and contains the names of famous alumni like George C  Marshall  Harry F  Byrd Jr  and Bobby Ross  They were once just like the new cadets of 2015  nervous new cadets   or  rats    adding their names to the ledger   The signing of the Matriculation Book is a lot bigger than anyone realizes  said Loken   You know when you are writing your name in that  I m joining this incredible school  I m signing right next to George C  Marshall  I felt like John Hancock signing the Declaration of Independence  It means a lot to have your name in that book   It seems as simple as just signing a book  but it s so much more than that  Ranger added   Soon you realize that everyone who has been through VMI signed that book  That s just awesome to me  Once a cadet s name is inscribed  it is there forever  Now calling 281 290  281 290  To the left of the Matriculation Book  new cadets were herded back upstairs  It was quieter here  the drone of voices just a murmur and the anonymous man on the PA system distant  Here was another separation as well  as cadets were pushed to the right to an area parents are forbidden to enter  They met up again with their parents to attend the Matriculation Fair and get set up in barracks  They had some time together as they listened to Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendent  deliver his welcome address  After the speech  though  they were sent in different directions  a preview of the end of the day  when parents come to the realization that they will not see their cadets again until New Cadet Oath Day  Sept  6  at New Market  With some looking over their shoulders  watching their parents walk away  the new cadets were measured for their uniforms  which will be distributed next week  in time for the first inspection  They were handed six sets of gym dyke  the uniforms they will wear during the numerous physical training sessions that await them  They were handed another dose of reality   You have the anticipation when you get your gym dyke  but it gets really  really gut wrenchingly real when you hear the words   Rats  meet your cadre  That s when your whole life just changes  Now calling 301 310  301 310  The anonymous voice was cut off as the door to Cameron Hall slammed shut  The buildings across the street loomed menacingly over the new cadets  and a wide range of emotions worked their way through the group  Some were eager  chomping at the bit for the invitation to join their companies  Some were a bit nervous  and others were downright terrified  And at some point during Matriculation Day  almost all of them probably second guessed their decisions to attend VMI  For those  cadets who have gone before offered a bit of advice   Stay the course  said Ranger   It s going to get hard  even for the most

have noticed at Cameron Hall Saturday morning as the new cadets gathered at VMI for Matriculation Day 2015 was the sound  With the hundreds of people   new cadets  parents  faculty  and staff   seemingly all speaking at once  their collective voices became a low drone  like the buzzing of bees  and understanding what any one individual had to say was next to impossible  But one voice rang loud and clear  anonymously belting his invitation over the public address system  Matriculation by the Numbers Total  495 In State  302 Out of State  193 Males  442 Females      53 STEM Major  63 4  Liberal Arts Majors  36 6  States Represented      31 Foreign Countries      5   Now calling 131 140  131 140  Each new number set was the signal for new cadets falling in that range  their names  numbers  and companies spelled out on placards attached to their shirts  to head to the floor  Thus  the 495 new cadets got their first taste of VMI creating order out of chaos   It s nerve wracking  but it s also exciting  said Kayla Ranger  18  Company G s lead EMT  as she recalled her Matriculation Day   It gets really real  really fast   I remember standing right there at that Marine Corps table and getting scared out of my mind  added Connor Loken  17  the team lead EMT for Company I   It s weird because these guys don t know what s coming  At the bottom of the stairs  families were met by admissions office staff  and with the drone becoming louder as more and more people filed into the facility  new cadets weaved their way through a maze of important tables   the commandant s office  financial aid  the comptroller and  finally  the registrar  Now calling 141 150  141 150  It was at the registrar s table that reality hit  Oh  parents were proud  parading around the Cameron Hall floor with their newly purchased VMI garb  So were siblings  many of them prancing near the tables  red and yellow pom poms dancing along with them  But at this point  they were cordoned off from their new cadet  asked to stay behind the roped off area  at VMI but not quite a part of it  If there was separation anxiety  it hit there first   That was tough  saying good bye to    my parents  said Ranger   When they left  that was the last bit of home I had  You don t get home luxuries  here  Now calling 271 280  271 280  It all happened so fast  despite the wait in line to talk to ROTC officers or professors at tables laid out for the each of the majors offered at VMI  Soon  the new cadets made their way around the circuit and found themselves facing the Matriculation Book  To some  this is the most important tome on post  a book that has been signed by generations of new cadets and contains the names of famous alumni like George C  Marshall  Harry F  Byrd Jr  and Bobby Ross  They were once just like the new cadets of 2015  nervous new cadets   or  rats    adding their names to the ledger   The signing of the Matriculation Book is a lot bigger than anyone realizes  said Loken   You know when you are writing your name in that  I m joining this incredible school  I m signing right next to George C  Marshall  I felt like John Hancock signing the Declaration of Independence  It means a lot to have your name in that book   It seems as simple as just signing a book  but it s so much more than that  Ranger added   Soon you realize that everyone who has been through VMI signed that book  That s just awesome to me  Once a cadet s name is inscribed  it is there forever  Now calling 281 290  281 290  To the left of the Matriculation Book  new cadets were herded back upstairs  It was quieter here  the drone of voices just a murmur and the anonymous man on the PA system distant  Here was another separation as well  as cadets were pushed to the right to an area parents are forbidden to enter  They met up again with their parents to attend the Matriculation Fair and get set up in barracks  They had some time together as they listened to Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  VMI superintendent  deliver his welcome address  After the speech  though  they were sent in different directions  a preview of the end of the day  when parents come to the realization that they will not see their cadets again until New Cadet Oath Day  Sept  6  at New Market  With some looking over their shoulders  watching their parents walk away  the new cadets were measured for their uniforms  which will be distributed next week  in time for the first inspection  They were handed six sets of gym dyke  the uniforms they will wear during the numerous physical training sessions that await them  They were handed another dose of reality   You have the anticipation when you get your gym dyke  but it gets really  really gut wrenchingly real when you hear the words   Rats  meet your cadre  That s when your whole life just changes  Now calling 301 310  301 310  The anonymous voice was cut off as the door to Cameron Hall slammed shut  The buildings across the street loomed menacingly over the new cadets  and a wide range of emotions worked their way through the group  Some were eager  chomping at the bit for the invitation to join their companies  Some were a bit nervous  and others were downright terrified  And at some point during Matriculation Day  almost all of them probably second guessed their decisions to attend VMI  For those  cadets who
