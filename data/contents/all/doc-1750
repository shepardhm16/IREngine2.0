job well done  the VMI chapter of Engineers without Borders is already focusing on its next endeavor   fundraising for Phase 2 of an irrigation project begun in Bolivia in August  We have so many people who are interested  I sense a real growth in this program  said Maj  Tim Moore  97  assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering  the club s faculty adviser  And I think students are really searching for this kind of experience  something above and beyond just being a student  The original goal of the Bolivian project was to build an irrigation system to support crops and livestock in Pampoyo  a farming village situated 13 000 feet above sea level in the country s Potosi Region   Moore said village water was so contaminated with lead and silver from mining runoff that farm animals were dying because they refused to drink it  During Phase I  club members built a catchment basin upstream from the mining operation and laid 2 000 feet of pipe downstream   Moore said each morning about 20 villagers from Pampoyo waited for the EWOB group at the top of the hill so they could help out   Several of the locals were old men who used their hands to help dig the 2 000 feet of trench space  which was completed in only two days  Since August is wintertime in Bolivia  working conditions weren t always ideal   Although midday temperatures often reached the 60s in the sun  mornings were cold  with temperatures often in the teens and 20s   Club members all slept in a one room school house  It was pretty intense  Moore said    The plan now is to raise the  15 000 needed to purchase the remaining 8 000 feet of irrigation pipe  which will be shipped to Bolivia and installed by locals who were trained and taught the route of the pipeline by chapter members   Moore will take another group to Pampoyo in June to install two 6 000 liter water storage tanks and put the finishing touches on the 10 000 foot pipeline  which will pipe the water from the catchment basin to tanks that will make it accessible for irrigation  The Bolivian irrigation project has been a collaborative effort between VMI and W L students and faculty   This summer  four W L students accompanied the six cadets who made the trip  along with W L engineering professor Jon Erickson   A recent club meeting was attended by about 25 cadets and 12 W L students who were interested in getting involved with EWOB  Matthew Waalkes  13  a biology major who is seeking a writing minor  went to Pampoyo in June mainly because he wanted to do humanitarian work   As part of a writing internship  though  he also handled public relations and recorded health surveys of villagers  Seeing the conditions that the villagers lived in was disheartening and illuminating  Waalkes said  The trip also made me aware of the difference between poverty and destitution  These people had so little  And yet they seemed happier  more satisfied with life  Waalkes would like to return to Pampoyo next summer  but he said interest in the trip is running so high among students that he might step back to let someone else go  Moore said the work in Pampoyo is a sustained effort that will continue year after year until they tell us they no longer need us  Future projects could include construction of latrines  schools and health clinics    Women who are pregnant have to walk three hours to the nearest medical facility  aid Nohelia Martin  08  a VMI alumna from La Paz who served as the group s translator in Bolivia    VMI s chapter has received strong support from both the department of civil engineering and the dean s office  including seed money for operations   The club is also reaching out to local Rotary clubs and businesses and the VMI alumni community for support   Cadets must pay their own travel expenses  Anyone wishing to contribute may visit the chapter s site at www vmiewb com donate html or the VMI Foundation s site at www vmialumni org donate  To make sure the donation goes to the Pampoyo project  select other and then type in  EWBVMI  VMI s Engineers without Borders became an official chapter in December of 2010   Guided by Moore  the club has elected officers and is working cooperatively with the Blue Ridge professional chapter of Engineers without Borders  Engineers without borders is a misnomer  it s biologists  chemists  business majors  anybody coming together to do one thing  which is help people  Moore said   George Abry   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT
