Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Feb  14  Elections amid Unrest  Download pdf The upcoming election Feb  14 in Nigeria pits a Christian incumbent with total control over patronage of centralized oil but no control   none   over the violence of Boko Haram against a Muslim former military dictator  So is perhaps the biggest challenger in a democratic election a former dictator  Why is Goodluck Jonathan perhaps favored to win in spite of all the violence  Just what on earth is going on   social  political dynamics  currents  Hentz  The reason why it may appear that Goodluck Jonathan has an early advantage would be that he has control over the patronage resources  he has control to some extent over the media and outflow of information  so he ll use his considerable resources to make it appear as if he s the likely winner  I probably would not bet on that being the actual fact  Gire  I think I would agree with that assessment  In fact  my first thought when you floated that idea was that I didn t know that he was expected or favored to be the winner  On the contrary  many would argue that unless the ruling government does something underhanded he stands very little chance of winning the election  But to address specifically the issue of the Christian south controlling resources versus the Muslim  I think Nigeria is more nuanced than many people think  Not that long ago  if you remember  Moshood  Kashimawo Olawale  Abiola was said to have won what at that time  1993  were deemed the most free and fair elections in Nigeria s history  What is often lost is that fact that both Abiola and  Baba Gana  Kingibe were Muslim  so a Muslim Muslim ticket won overwhelming votes in Nigeria  It was General  Ibrahim  Babangida who nullified the election  in fact  that perpetrated a crisis referred to as June 12 that ultimately would lead to the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo because it was deemed that Abiola being from the southwest was deprived and therefore the southwest was owed the presidency  So when Obasanjo in 1999 was contesting the politicians from the north  the party deliberately did not contest for the nomination  It was actually handed to them  What many people don t realize is that sometimes the general Nigerian public yearns for military intervention in the face of just reckless corruption with impunity as is happening just right now  Security is usually a very important issue for any country  and there has been insecurity for years  And there is a general perception  and I will argue a reality  that the current government has been unable to address or to effectively handle the problem  The impression therefore is that being a strong military leader  perhaps that s the kind of person that will be needed at this particular point in time to tackle the insurgency  Hentz  When the United States was getting ready to allow Japan to elect its own leaders to free it from its  United States  control and we were doing this because we wanted Japan to be a voluntary ally against the Soviet Union and the discussion was  well  Japan isn t ready yet  they ll probably choose an authoritative leader  And the response in Washington was  they need stability probably more than they need a Jeffersonian democracy  We in the West tend to think they  you  can telescope political development and think that you can get everything at once  I agree with James 100 percent  He may have been a dictator  but if he s elected  he s no longer a dictator he s an elected president first of all  and second of all the notion that he is a military man may resonate throughout the country and give them the stability that they need  I think it s frankly setting a bad precedent if Goodluck Jonathan does win  When he ascended to the presidency because the previous president died   I was in Nigeria at the time   and there were rumors of a coup d etat and instability because he was breaking the tradition of alternating northerners and southerners  and frankly it s probably a northerner s time to be the president  Gire  They call it the rotation of the presidency  When Jonathan insisted and got re elected  generally speaking including people like   President Obasanjo himself  say that he promised them that he was going to do just one additional term  So his now wanting to do another four years after doing six is viewed as breaking a promise  a solemn promise he had made  Copyright   2015 Virginia Military Institute  For academic and news media use only  No quotes from the
