Commander Talks About 21st Century Challenges  Opportunities LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  3  2014   The former NATO supreme allied commander Europe told an audience of VMI cadets  faculty  and Cold War scholars earlier today that building bridges  not walls  will be key to solving the myriad security challenges facing the global community in the 21st century  Retired Navy Adm  James Stavridis  who served as NATO s 16th commander from 2009 to 2013  gave the keynote address   21st Century Security  Challenges and Opportunities  as part of a Nov  3 4 conference   The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs During the Ronald Reagan Era  The conference is sponsored by the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis and the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics  Approximately 230 scholars  including 27 panelists or speakers  have converged to attend the conference  the first of its kind offered by the Adams Center  The Marshall Example  Outreach  Not Isolationism For retired Navy Adm  James Stavridis  the old adage   Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it  is more than just a passing phrase  it s a guiding principle  As part of  The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs During the Ronald Reagan Era  Stavridis spoke both before and during his keynote address about the danger of American isolationism   There s this enormous sense of fatigue  and particularly with the Middle East  said Stavridis before his address  This is understandable  he acknowledged  after more than a decade of what he termed  unfulfilling  military action in Iraq and Afghanistan  and a price tag that soared past the  2 trillion mark   Despite this  Stavridis doesn t have to look far to find an exemplar of a military man who strove past war fatigue to become a moral and military giant  General of the Army George C  Marshall  VMI class of 1901  whose post World War II Marshall Plan helped Europe recover from the devastation of six years of war   The Marshall Plan is  probably the best single example of desire to engage in the world even when it doesn t appear to be in your best interest in the short run to do so  said Stavridis  who retired from a 37 year career with the Navy in 2013  after serving as NATO supreme allied commander Europe from 2009 to 2013  Stavridis was the first Navy officer to hold that position   Near the end of his remarks in Gillis Theater  Stavridis gave another reminder that the past should exist not in a dusty history book  or a seldom visited Web page  but in the hearts and minds of engaged citizens today  Displaying an image of the program from the 1940 Army Navy football game  Stavridis gestured to the back cover  which showed a warship plowing confidently forward  The caption  he noted  read  The unsinkable U S S  Arizona   Just over a year later  the unsinkable ship was at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean  sunk by Japanese bombs during the Dec  7  1941  attack on Pearl Harbor  Said Stavridis   The unexpected can and will overtake us   That uncertainty  though  cannot be an excuse for avoiding engagement  As Stavridis noted before his address   It would be a disaster if the American public  today  turned inward in a spate of isolationism  Mary Price   In addition  approximately 320 cadets are involved in some way  said Lt  Col  Brad Coleman  95  associate professor of history and director of the Adams Center   I expect we ll have about 40 percent of the Corps here at some point  Coleman noted  National Security Challenges Speaking to a capacity crowd in Gillis Theater  Stavridis set the stage for discussing 21st century security by offering a look at 20th century security efforts that were tried   and failed  In the first of several slides  Stavridis showed a group of cadets gathered for a class picture at the famed French military academy  cole Sp ciale Militaire de Saint Cyr in 1914  on the eve of the outbreak of World War I  By 1918  Stavridis said  everyone in the picture was dead   This is the beginning of 20th century security  which is  let s face it  a disaster  said Stavridis  a 1976 graduate of the United States Naval Academy who is now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University  Two decades later  he observed  it seemed as if the world had learned little from the conflict then called the Great War  A death toll of over 1 million in the World War II battle of Stalingrad alone was followed by what the retired Navy admiral called the  seemingly inevitable  collision between the United States and the Soviet Union  The Berlin Wall  Stavridis said  became the pre eminent image of 20th century security  For Stavridis  the realization that walls wouldn t work anymore came on the calm and beautiful morning of Sept  11  2001  when he was just 200 feet and two floors away when an airplane hijacked by Islamic terrorists plowed into the Pentagon  Then a newly minted one star admiral  Stavridis was in his supervisor s office when a glimpse of metal and a whooshing sound were followed by smoke and fire and flames   Here I was that day in the safest building in the world  said Stavridis   in the headquarters of the strongest military in the world  in the capital of the richest nation ever known  Was I safe on that day    I think what we re learning in the 21st century is that we have to find ways to build bridges  to play the long game  in order to create real security  Stavridis next led his audience through a quick but thorough overview of the world s many  hot spots  of conflict among them North Korea  Syria  the Ukraine  and Afghanistan   and commented on each  He also paid special attention to Asia  noting the  increasing assertiveness  of Japan and growing tensions in the Sino Japanese relationship  Stavridis also discussed issues straddling national or even regional borders  including the Ebola epidemic  cyber attacks  environmental concerns  economic inequality  political gridlock  and isolationism  before moving on to the second half of his talk  opportunities  Launching Ideas At this point  Stavridis told his audience  it s time to roll up sleeves and get to work  rather than shrink back in anxiety or retreat into passivity   So often the conversation stops with a long litany of fear and risk  he observed   We have to think   What do we do about this  Speaking to the numerous cadets in the audience  the admiral urged them to prepare for the 21st century s challenges by listening  so as to better understand others  by learning languages  and by reading broadly from works of both fiction and non fiction   To understand a time  read the literature of that time  said Stavridis as he showed a montage of jackets from books he d read while preparing for his role at NATO  On a broader scale  Stavridis said he would like to see the international community pay more attention to issues such as cyber security    We need a cyber force  and sooner than later  he observed   the position of women across the globe  universal literacy and the increasingly important role of humanitarian missions such as the one the U S  has recently launched in response to the Ebola epidemic  Showing a photo of a U S  Navy destroyer launching a Tomahawk missile  Stavridis observed   The Navy is  very  very good at launching Tomahawk missiles  We need to be better at launching ideas  Cooperation and bridge building  Stavridis believes  will take the United States and the global community places that wall building never could   The challenges are immense if we look at them as a thicket out there  said Stavridis in a question and answer period after his remarks   But no one of us is as smart as all of us thinking together  Coleman  who met Stavridis while the two men were working together at the U S  Southern Command in Miami seven years ago  said that plans for a conference on the Reagan era had been in the works long before he arrived at VMI as director of the Adams Center in 2012  The timing of this year s conference  he noted  was quite fortuitous   The recent declassification of Reagan administration records makes this the ideal moment for us to go back and look at the Reagan period   and think about the connections between the Reagan era and contemporary national security affairs  said Coleman   Mary
