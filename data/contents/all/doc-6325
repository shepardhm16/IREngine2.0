conducting involves the development of a genetically modified plant  the Virginia soybean  to will produce high seed yield and optimized cell wall biomolecules enabling use of its stem residues as a fuel crop  My goal is to apply fundamental knowledge about plant chemistry to the genetic engineering of a dual use food and fuel crop plant to be cultivated on the same plot of land  Research Student Matthew Waalkes  13                 Harvesting soybeans as part of the research for his Institute Honors Thesis Research Interests Conducting research  especially as a mentor to undergraduates  is an invigorating part of my position at VMI  The foundation of my research program is its interdisciplinary nature  I am a plant biologist trained in physiological  molecular  ecological  and biochemical techniques and it is the hypothesis that drives my research rather than the organism  Focusing on how plants partition carbon resources acquired by photosynthesis to produce unique chemistries  I have worked on unicellular algae  parsley cells in suspension culture  tobacco  soybean  and the genetic model  Arabidopsis  I have completed a project examining community ecology aspects of an invasive species  garlic mustard  and its impact on understory forest communities  Currently  my laboratory is one of three components of the new VMI CLEAR  Clean Energy and Air Resources  center that Drs  Moore  Pennington and I began in fall 2011  This center is working to train a workforce of students to develop sources of sustainable energy from plant biomass residues  The other components are housed in Civil Engineering Department  optimizing biofuel production from crop residues  and in the Department of English and Fine Arts which focuses on developing communication skills in our trained researchers  The research that I am conducting involves the development of a genetically modified plant  the Virginia soybean  to will produce high seed yield and optimized cell wall biomolecules
