two apparently unrelated issues   regional trade agreements and the pollution haven hypothesis  They are linked by the belief that the elimination of trade barriers will further encourage firms already considering a move to countries with weak environmental regulations  Given the proliferation of trade agreements  as well as the movement of environmental issues to the forefront of our political process  a better understanding of policy effects is needed  We apply a variation of the gravity model to a data set of industry level foreign direct investment from the Unites States to 26 partner countries from 1982 to 1999  We find strong evidence in support of the pollution haven hypothesis  We also find the NAFTA increase outflows of US FDI  Finally  the NAFTA appears to encourage the pollution haven effect  Regional Trade Agreements and Foreign Direct Investment North American Journal of Economics and Finance  2006 This paper investigates the relationship between regional trade agreements  such as the NAFTA  and FDI  Using both a fixed effects gravity model and knowledge capital model to estimate OECD panel data spanning 1982 to 1997  we learn that trade integration encourages FDI  We find specific evidence for each of the NAFTA member countries   Mexico  Canada and the United States  Support is also found for the notion of anticipatory effects  In addition  we find evidence that FDI will rise with host and parent country GDP and fall with distance  Evidence Linking Exchange Rates and Foreign Direct Investment International Trade Journal  2008 This study investigates the effect of fluctuations in and volatility of the real exchange rate on foreign direct investment  A fixed effects variation of the gravity model is applied to panel data of 55 countries from 1980 to 1997  Weak host currencies and greater exchange rate volatility are found to discourage FDI flows  Further  an existing presence in the form of previous investment is found to mitigate the detrimental impact of a weak currency  Grade Dropping in Intermediate Macroeconomics forthcoming in the New York Economic Review When preparing a course  professors are often tempted to allow students to drop an exam  In many cases  this is done without a full understanding of the impact on the students overall performance  This study seeks to understand what impact this policy will have the student s performance in class  In addition  we will seek to understand the effects on the student s likelihood to miss an exam and to drop or withdraw from the course  We will use data from Intermediate Macroeconomics  One section of this course was taught each semester for ten semesters  In six of those semesters  students were allowed to drop one exam score while in the remaining four semesters  all scores were included in the final grade  Working Papers A Panel Study of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis revise and resubmit at the Global Economy Journal This paper tests the pollution haven hypothesis  We apply a fixed effects variation of the gravity model to panel data to investigate what relationship  if any  exists between environmental regulations and FDI  The data set focuses on bilateral flows of aggregated foreign direct investment between the 26 OECD countries from 1982 to 1997  We find strong evidence in support of the pollution haven hypothesis  In other words  firms do  in fact  seek out countries with weaker environmental regulations for production  In addition  FDI appears to rise with country size  both host and source  but falls with distance  Contrary to expectations  FDI is not influenced by interest rates and wages  Grade Dropping  Strategic Behavior  and Student Satisficing under review at the Journal of Financial Education An extensive database of exam scores is studied to determine the effects of a grading policy that drops the lowest exam score  We find evidence that some students engage in strategic behavior  by understudying for one of the exams  We also find evidence that many students  satisfice  showing how a large percentage of students passed up an expected improvement in their course grade  We find that the probability a student will choose to complete an optional final exam is inversely related to their grade going into the final  Further  the likelihood of a student completing the final exam rises with the spread between prior exam scores and falls with the points needed to raise their course grade  A Panel Study of Foreign Direct Investment and Trade The relationship between trade and multinational activity is a basic issue in international economics as well as a controversial mainstream issue  Does greater foreign direct investment abroad displace domestic production and exports  How do inflows of FDI influence imports  This study uses bilateral panel data of trade and FDI flows between 28 OECD countries and 55 partner countries  27 non OECD countries along with 28 OECD countries  from 1980 to 1997  A fixed effects gravity model of trade is applied to the data  The evidence confirms the conclusion found in earlier country focused studies   trade and foreign direct investment are complements rather than substitutes  as much of the earlier research found  However  this relationship is only found for developed countries interacting with other developed countries  It fails to hold for developed countries interacting with developing countries  Student Perceptions of Current and Ideal Learning and Grade Orientations in Economics Courses with Lester Hadsell and Mary Ellen Mallia Research in educational psychology has shown that students have some amount of both a  grade orientation  and a  learning orientation  or  more generally  performance and mastery approaches  respectively  A mastery approach is associated with higher levels of cognitive engagement  more effort and persistence  and better performance compared to students with a performance approach  This study documents grade and learning orientations in economics students and compares these to students  ideal or preferred orientation  Immigration and Foreign Direct Investment with James Bang There is an ongoing debate within economics as to the relationship between the flows of immigrants and the flow of foreign direct investment  One camp argues that these flows are substitutes  That is  as foreign direct investment flows in to a country  say from the United States to Mexico  immigration flows in the opposite direction should fall  There are those who believe this relationship fails to hold  They believe that as FDI flows in to a country  the outward flow of immigrants will actually rise The OECD makes bilateral data available on both immigration and foreign direct investment flows  We will utilize this data in the hopes of confirming either the complementary or substitutive relationship between the flows of labor and capital  The Effects of the EMU on FDI through the Elimination of Exchange Rate Volatility This study investigates the relationship between foreign direct investment and fluctuations in and volatility of the nominal exchange rate  A fixed effects variation of the gravity model is applied to panel data of 55 countries from 1980 to 1997  Weak host currencies and greater exchange rate volatility are found to discourage FDI flows  As a result  participation in exchange rate policies such as dollarization and currency unions would likely increase flows of FDI as they eliminate nominal exchange rate uncertainty  The Effect of Natural Disaster on International Trade If a country is hit by a large scale natural disaster  the economy will certainly be negatively affected  Using earthquake data from the U S  Geological Survey as the basis for analysis  this paper researches the impact such a disaster potentially has on trade and the economy  On the one hand  domestic production would fall causing imports to rise and exports to fall  On the other hand  greater demand due to the relief effort would cause imports to rise  as relief comes in from abroad  while domestic production is redirected from export to local consumption  As a result  we expect an earthquake would cause the trade deficit to rise  Book Chapters The Environment and Trade with Atin Basu and James Bang Encyclopedia of Environmental Health  under review This chapter will review the effects of trade and trade agreements on the environment  It shows the impact of trade on income  Income will  in turn  impact the environment  Lastly  this chapter discusses the plausibility of international trade agreements as a vehicle for environmental change  Environmental regulations and the flow of FDI  The Pollution Haven Hypothesis Foreign Direct Investment  forthcoming This chapter will review what is known as the Pollution Haven Hypothesis  This hypothesis states a firm will move its production facilities to countries with relatively weak environmental regulations in order to capitalize on the lower production costs  Given the proliferation of environmental agreements both at the national and international level  their impact on international flows of investment capital is certainly of interest  Over the years  a variety of approaches have been taken to empirically prove the Pollution Haven Hypothesis  These range from straightforward statistical comparisons to within region studies to cross border studies  Unfortunately  at this time there is no clear consensus as to the effects of more stringent environmental regulations on the flows of FDI  One key issue is preventing this research from establishing a clear conclusion  That is  the difficulty in quantifying environmental regulations  The challenge here lies  first  in the subjective nature of measuring laws on the books  Beyond that  measuring the application of the laws on the books is even more elusive  A common approach is to use a proxy  However  finding a suitable one is difficult  Until a generally agreed upon approach can be found for dealing with the immeasurable nature of environmental regulations  true evidence of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis will continue to elude researchers
