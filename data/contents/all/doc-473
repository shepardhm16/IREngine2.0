and most basic pure science  its discoveries find applications throughout the natural sciences  since matter and energy are the basic constituents of the natural world  The other sciences are generally more limited in their scope and may be considered branches that have split off from physics to become sciences in their own right  Physics today may be divided loosely into classical physics
