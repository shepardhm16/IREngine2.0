Market top level   Scott Shipp  1839 1917  commanded the Corps of Cadets at the Battle of New Market  Shipp graduated from VMI in 1859  taught Latin  Mathematics  and Tactics  served as Commandant of Cadets from 1862 89  and as the Institute s second Superintendent from 1890 1907  Headquarters Corps of Cadets  July 4  1864  General  In obedience to General Orders No  21  Headquarters Virginia Military Institute  June 27  1864  I have the honor to submit the following report of the Corps of Cadets  under my command  in the field  from May 11th to June 25th  inclusive  In obedience to orders from Major General Breckinridge  communicated through you  at 7 a m  on the morning of May 11th  the Corps of Cadets  consisting of a battalion of four companies of infantry and a section of 3 inch rifled guns  took up the line of march for Staunton  The march to Staunton was accomplished in two days  I preceded the column on the second day some hours for the purpose of reporting to General Breckinridge  and was ordered by him to put the Cadets in camp one mile south of Staunton  On the morning of the 13th  I received orders to march at daylight on the road to Harrisonburg  taking position in the column in the rear of Echols s Brigade  We marched eighteen miles and encamped  moved at daylight on the 14th  marched sixteen miles and encamped  At 1 o clock on the night of the 14th received orders to prepare to march immediately  without beat of drums and as noiselessly as possible  We moved from camp at 1 30 o clock  taking position in the general column in rear of Echols s Brigade  being followed by the column of artillery under the command of Major McLaughlin  Having accomplished a distance of six miles  and approached the position of the enemy  as indicated by occasional skirmishing with his pickets in front  a halt was called  and we remained on the side of the road two or three hours in the midst of a heavy fall of rain  The General having determined to receive the attack of the enemy  made his dispositions for battle  posting the Corps in reserve  He informed me that he did not wish to put the cadets in if he could avoid it  but that should occasion require it he would use them very freely  He was also pleased to express his confidence in them  and I am happy to believe that his expectations were not disappointed  for when the tug of battle came they bore themselves gallantly and well  The enemy not making the attack as was anticipated  and not advancing as rapidly as was desired  the line was deployed into column and the advance resumed  Here I was informed by one of General Breckinridge s aides  that my battalion  together with the battalion of Colonel G  M  Edgar  would constitute the reserve  and was instructed to keep the section of artillery with the column  and to take position  after the deployments should have been made  two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards in the rear of the front line of battle  and to maintain that distance  Having begun a flank movement to the left  about two miles south of New Market  the nature of the ground was such as to render it impossible that the artillery should continue with the infantry column  I ordered Lieutenant Minge to join the general artillery column on the main road and to report to Major McLaughlin  After that I did not see the section of artillery until near the close of the engagement  Major McLaughlin  under whose command they served  was pleased to speak of the section in such complimentary terms that I was satisfied then that they had done their duty  Continuing the advance on the ground to the left of the main road  and south of New Market  at 12 30 p m  we came under fire of the enemy s batteries  Having advanced a quarter of a mile under the fire  we were halted  and the column was deployed  the march up to this time having been by flank in column  The ground in front was open  with skirts of woods on the left  Here General Breckinridge sent for me  and gave me in person my instructions  The General s plans seem to have undergone some modification  Instead of one line  with a reserve  he formed his infantry in two  artillery in rear and to the right  the cavalry deployed and guarding the right flank  left flank resting on a stream  Wharton s Brigade of infantry constituted the first line  Echol s brigade the second  The battalion of Cadets  brigaded with Echols  was the last battalion but one from the left of the second line  Edgar s battalion being on the left  The lines having been adjusted  the order to advance was passed  Wharton s line advanced  Echols followed at two hundred and fifty paces in the rear  As Wharton s line ascended a knoll it came in full view of the enemy s batteries  which opened a heavy fire  but not having gotten the range  did but little damage  By the time the second line reached the same ground  the Yankee gunners had gotten the exact range and their fire begun to tell on our line with fearful accuracy  It was here that Captain Hill and others fell  Great gaps were made through the ranks  but the Cadet  true to his discipline  would close in to the center to fill the interval  and push steadily forward  The alignment of the battalion under this terrible fire  which strewed the ground with killed and wounded for more than a mile on open ground  would have been creditable even on a field day  The advance was thus continued  until  having passed Bushong s house  a mile or more beyond New Market  and still to the left of the main road  the enemy s batteries  at two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards  opened upon us with canister and case shot  and their long lines of infantry were put into action at the same time  The fire was withering  It seemed impossible that any living creature could escape  and here we sustained our heaviest loss  a great many being wounded and numbers knocked down  stunned  and temporarily disabled  I was here disabled for a time  and the command devolved upon Company A  He gallantly pressed onward  We had before this gotten into the front line  Our line took a position behind a line of fence  A brisk fusillade ensued  a shout  a rush  and the day was won  The enemy fled in confusion  leaving killed  wounded  artillery and prisoners in our hands  Our men pursued in hot haste  until it became necessary to halt  draw ammunition  and reestablish the lines for the purpose of driving them from their last position on Rude s Hill  which they   held with cavalry and artillery  to cover the passage of the river  about a mile in their rear  Our troops charged and took the position without loss  The enemy withdrew  crossed the river  and burnt the bridge  The engagement closed at 6 30 p m  The Cadets did their duty  as the long list of casualties will attest  Numerous instances of gallantry might be mentioned  but I have thought it better to refrain from specifying individual cases  for fear of making invidious distinctions  or from want of information withholding praise where it might have been justly merited  It had rained almost incessantly during the battle  and at its termination the Cadets were well nigh exhausted  Wet  hungry  and many of them shoeless for they had lost their shoes and socks in the deep mud through which it was necessary to march  they bore their hardships with the uncomplaining resignation which characterizes the true soldier  The 16th and 17th were devoted to caring for the wounded and the burial of the dead  On the 17th I received an order from General Breckinridge to report to General Imboden  with the request on the part of General Breckinridge  that the Corps be relieved from further duty and be ordered back to the Institute  The circumstances of General Imboden s situation were such as to render our detention for a time necessary  We were finally ordered by him to proceed to Staunton  without delay  for the purpose of proceeding by rail to Richmond  in obedience to a call from the Secretary of War  Returning  the Corps marched into Staunton on the 21st  took the cars on the 22d  reached Richmond on the 23d  were stationed at Camp Lee until the 28th  were then ordered to report to Major General Ransom  ordered by him to encamp on the intermediate line  On the 28th left Camp Lee  took up camp on Carter s farm  on intermediate line  midway between Brook and Meadow

Civil War Resources   New Market   Shipp Report  Battle of New Market Report of Lt  Col  Scott Shipp Battle of New Market  Virginia  May 15  1864  New Market top level   Scott Shipp  1839 1917  commanded the Corps of Cadets at the Battle of New Market  Shipp graduated from VMI in 1859  taught Latin  Mathematics  and Tactics  served as Commandant of Cadets from 1862 89  and as the Institute s second Superintendent from 1890 1907  Headquarters Corps of Cadets  July 4  1864  General  In obedience to General Orders No  21  Headquarters Virginia Military Institute  June 27  1864  I have the honor to submit the following report of the Corps of Cadets  under my command  in the field  from May 11th to June 25th  inclusive  In obedience to orders from Major General Breckinridge  communicated through you  at 7 a m  on the morning of May 11th  the Corps of Cadets  consisting of a battalion of four companies of infantry and a section of 3 inch rifled guns  took up the line of march for Staunton  The march to Staunton was accomplished in two days  I preceded the column on the second day some hours for the purpose of reporting to General Breckinridge  and was ordered by him to put the Cadets in camp one mile south of Staunton  On the morning of the 13th  I received orders to march at daylight on the road to Harrisonburg  taking position in the column in the rear of Echols s Brigade  We marched eighteen miles and encamped  moved at daylight on the 14th  marched sixteen miles and encamped  At 1 o clock on the night of the 14th received orders to prepare to march immediately  without beat of drums and as noiselessly as possible  We moved from camp at 1 30 o clock  taking position in the general column in rear of Echols s Brigade  being followed by the column of artillery under the command of Major McLaughlin  Having accomplished a distance of six miles  and approached the position of the enemy  as indicated by occasional skirmishing with his pickets in front  a halt was called  and we remained on the side of the road two or three hours in the midst of a heavy fall of rain  The General having determined to receive the attack of the enemy  made his dispositions for battle  posting the Corps in reserve  He informed me that he did not wish to put the cadets in if he could avoid it  but that should occasion require it he would use them very freely  He was also pleased to express his confidence in them  and I am happy to believe that his expectations were not disappointed  for when the tug of battle came they bore themselves gallantly and well  The enemy not making the attack as was anticipated  and not advancing as rapidly as was desired  the line was deployed into column and the advance resumed  Here I was informed by one of General Breckinridge s aides  that my battalion  together with the battalion of Colonel G  M  Edgar  would constitute the reserve  and was instructed to keep the section of artillery with the column  and to take position  after the deployments should have been made  two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards in the rear of the front line of battle  and to maintain that distance  Having begun a flank movement to the left  about two miles south of New Market  the nature of the ground was such as to render it impossible that the artillery should continue with the infantry column  I ordered Lieutenant Minge to join the general artillery column on the main road and to report to Major McLaughlin  After that I did not see the section of artillery until near the close of the engagement  Major McLaughlin  under whose command they served  was pleased to speak of the section in such complimentary terms that I was satisfied then that they had done their duty  Continuing the advance on the ground to the left of the main road  and south of New Market  at 12 30 p m  we came under fire of the enemy s batteries  Having advanced a quarter of a mile under the fire  we were halted  and the column was deployed  the march up to this time having been by flank in column  The ground in front was open  with skirts of woods on the left  Here General Breckinridge sent for me  and gave me in person my instructions  The General s plans seem to have undergone some modification  Instead of one line  with a reserve  he formed his infantry in two  artillery in rear and to the right  the cavalry deployed and guarding the right flank  left flank resting on a stream  Wharton s Brigade of infantry constituted the first line  Echol s brigade the second  The battalion of Cadets  brigaded with Echols  was the last battalion but one from the left of the second line  Edgar s battalion being on the left  The lines having been adjusted  the order to advance was passed  Wharton s line advanced  Echols followed at two hundred and fifty paces in the rear  As Wharton s line ascended a knoll it came in full view of the enemy s batteries  which opened a heavy fire  but not having gotten the range  did but little damage  By the time the second line reached the same ground  the Yankee gunners had gotten the exact range and their fire begun to tell on our line with fearful accuracy  It was here that Captain Hill and others fell  Great gaps were made through the ranks  but the Cadet  true to his discipline  would close in to the center to fill the interval  and push steadily forward  The alignment of the battalion under this terrible fire  which strewed the ground with killed and wounded for more than a mile on open ground  would have been creditable even on a field day  The advance was thus continued  until  having passed Bushong s house  a mile or more beyond New Market  and still to the left of the main road  the enemy s batteries  at two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards  opened upon us with canister and case shot  and their long lines of infantry were put into action at the same time  The fire was withering  It seemed impossible that any living creature could escape  and here we sustained our heaviest loss  a great many being wounded and numbers knocked down  stunned  and temporarily disabled  I was here disabled for a time  and the command devolved upon Company A  He gallantly pressed onward  We had before this gotten into the front line  Our line took a position behind a line of fence  A brisk fusillade ensued  a shout  a rush  and the day was won  The enemy fled in confusion  leaving killed  wounded  artillery and prisoners in our hands  Our men pursued in hot haste  until it became necessary to halt  draw ammunition  and reestablish the lines for the purpose of driving them from their last position on Rude s Hill  which they   held with cavalry and artillery  to cover the passage of the river  about a mile in their rear  Our troops charged and took the position without loss  The enemy withdrew  crossed the river  and burnt the bridge  The engagement closed at 6 30 p m  The Cadets did their duty  as the long list of casualties will attest  Numerous instances of gallantry might be mentioned  but I have thought it better to refrain from specifying individual cases  for fear of making invidious distinctions  or from want of information withholding praise where it might have been justly merited  It had rained almost incessantly during the battle  and at its termination the Cadets were well nigh exhausted  Wet  hungry  and many of them shoeless for they had lost their shoes and socks in the deep mud through which it was necessary to march  they bore their hardships with the uncomplaining resignation which characterizes the true soldier  The 16th and 17th were devoted to caring for the wounded and the burial of the dead  On the 17th I received an order from General Breckinridge to report to General Imboden  with the request on the part of General Breckinridge  that the Corps be relieved from further duty and be ordered back to the Institute  The circumstances of General Imboden s situation were such as to render our detention for a time necessary  We were finally ordered by him to proceed to Staunton  without delay  for the purpose of proceeding by rail to Richmond  in obedience to a call from the Secretary of War  Returning  the Corps marched into Staunton on the 21st  took the cars on the 22d  reached Richmond on the 23d  were stationed at Camp Lee until the 28th  were then ordered to report to Major General Ransom  ordered by him to encamp on the intermediate line  On the 28th left Camp Lee  took up camp on Carter s farm  on intermediate line  midway between Brook and Meadow Bridge roads  continued in this camp until June 6th  On the 6th received orders to return to Lexington  reached Lexington the 9th  Yankees approached on the 10th  drove us out on the 11th  we fell back  taking the Lynchburg road  marched to mouth of the North River  and went into camp  Next day  Sunday  the 12th  remained in camp until 1 p m  scouts reported enemy advancing  fell back two miles and took a position at a strong pass in the mountains to await the enemy  No enemy came  We were then ordered to Lynchburg  went there  ordered to report to General Vaughan  ordered back to Lexington  reached Lexington on the 25th  Corps

No  21  Headquarters Virginia Military Institute  June 27  1864  I have the honor to submit the following report of the Corps of Cadets  under my command  in the field  from May 11th to June 25th  inclusive  In obedience to orders from Major General Breckinridge  communicated through you  at 7 a m  on the morning of May 11th  the Corps of Cadets  consisting of a battalion of four companies of infantry and a section of 3 inch rifled guns  took up the line of march for Staunton  The march to Staunton was accomplished in two days  I preceded the column on the second day some hours for the purpose of reporting to General Breckinridge  and was ordered by him to put the Cadets in camp one mile south of Staunton  On the morning of the 13th  I received orders to march at daylight on the road to Harrisonburg  taking position in the column in the rear of Echols s Brigade  We marched eighteen miles and encamped  moved at daylight on the 14th  marched sixteen miles and encamped  At 1 o clock on the night of the 14th received orders to prepare to march immediately  without beat of drums and as noiselessly as possible  We moved from camp at 1 30 o clock  taking position in the general column in rear of Echols s Brigade  being followed by the column of artillery under the command of Major McLaughlin  Having accomplished a distance of six miles  and approached the position of the enemy  as indicated by occasional skirmishing with his pickets in front  a halt was called  and we remained on the side of the road two or three hours in the midst of a heavy fall of rain  The General having determined to receive the attack of the enemy  made his dispositions for battle  posting the Corps in reserve  He informed me that he did not wish to put the cadets in if he could avoid it  but that should occasion require it he would use them very freely  He was also pleased to express his confidence in them  and I am happy to believe that his expectations were not disappointed  for when the tug of battle came they bore themselves gallantly and well  The enemy not making the attack as was anticipated  and not advancing as rapidly as was desired  the line was deployed into column and the advance resumed  Here I was informed by one of General Breckinridge s aides  that my battalion  together with the battalion of Colonel G  M  Edgar  would constitute the reserve  and was instructed to keep the section of artillery with the column  and to take position  after the deployments should have been made  two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards in the rear of the front line of battle  and to maintain that distance  Having begun a flank movement to the left  about two miles south of New Market  the nature of the ground was such as to render it impossible that the artillery should continue with the infantry column  I ordered Lieutenant Minge to join the general artillery column on the main road and to report to Major McLaughlin  After that I did not see the section of artillery until near the close of the engagement  Major McLaughlin  under whose command they served  was pleased to speak of the section in such complimentary terms that I was satisfied then that they had done their duty  Continuing the advance on the ground to the left of the main road  and south of New Market  at 12 30 p m  we came under fire of the enemy s batteries  Having advanced a quarter of a mile under the fire  we were halted  and the column was deployed  the march up to this time having been by flank in column  The ground in front was open  with skirts of woods on the left  Here General Breckinridge sent for me  and gave me in person my instructions  The General s plans seem to have undergone some modification  Instead of one line  with a reserve  he formed his infantry in two  artillery in rear and to the right  the cavalry deployed and guarding the right flank  left flank resting on a stream  Wharton s Brigade of infantry constituted the first line  Echol s brigade the second  The battalion of Cadets  brigaded with Echols  was the last battalion but one from the left of the second line  Edgar s battalion being on the left  The lines having been adjusted  the order to advance was passed  Wharton s line advanced  Echols followed at two hundred and fifty paces in the rear  As Wharton s line ascended a knoll it came in full view of the enemy s batteries  which opened a heavy fire  but not having gotten the range  did but little damage  By the time the second line reached the same ground  the Yankee gunners had gotten the exact range and their fire begun to tell on our line with fearful accuracy  It was here that Captain Hill and others fell  Great gaps were made through the ranks  but the Cadet  true to his discipline  would close in to the center to fill the interval  and push steadily forward  The alignment of the battalion under this terrible fire  which strewed the ground with killed and wounded for more than a mile on open ground  would have been creditable even on a field day  The advance was thus continued  until  having passed Bushong s house  a mile or more beyond New Market  and still to the left of the main road  the enemy s batteries  at two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards  opened upon us with canister and case shot  and their long lines of infantry were put into action at the same time  The fire was withering  It seemed impossible that any living creature could escape  and here we sustained our heaviest loss  a great many being wounded and numbers knocked down  stunned  and temporarily disabled  I was here disabled for a time  and the command devolved upon Company A  He gallantly pressed onward  We had before this gotten into the front line  Our line took a position behind a line of fence  A brisk fusillade ensued  a shout  a rush  and the day was won  The enemy fled in confusion  leaving killed  wounded  artillery and prisoners in our hands  Our men pursued in hot haste  until it became necessary to halt  draw ammunition  and reestablish the lines for the purpose of driving them from their last position on Rude s Hill  which they   held with cavalry and artillery  to cover the passage of the river  about a mile in their rear  Our troops charged and took the position without loss  The enemy withdrew  crossed the river  and burnt the bridge  The engagement closed at 6 30 p m  The Cadets did their duty  as the long list of casualties will attest  Numerous instances of gallantry might be mentioned  but I have thought it better to refrain from specifying individual cases  for fear of making invidious distinctions  or from want of information withholding praise where it might have been justly merited  It had rained almost incessantly during the battle  and at its termination the Cadets were well nigh exhausted  Wet  hungry  and many of them shoeless for they had lost their shoes and socks in the deep mud through which it was necessary to march  they bore their hardships with the uncomplaining resignation which characterizes the true soldier  The 16th and 17th were devoted to caring for the wounded and the burial of the dead  On the 17th I received an order from General Breckinridge to report to General Imboden  with the request on the part of General Breckinridge  that the Corps be relieved from further duty and be ordered back to the Institute  The circumstances of General Imboden s situation were such as to render our detention for a time necessary  We were finally ordered by him to proceed to Staunton  without delay  for the purpose of proceeding by rail to Richmond  in obedience to a call from the Secretary of War  Returning  the Corps marched into Staunton on the 21st  took the cars on the 22d  reached Richmond on the 23d  were stationed at Camp Lee until the 28th  were then ordered to report to Major General Ransom  ordered by him to encamp on the intermediate line  On the 28th left Camp Lee  took up camp on Carter s farm

have the honor to submit the following report of the Corps of Cadets  under my command  in the field  from May 11th to June 25th  inclusive  In obedience to orders from Major General Breckinridge  communicated through you  at 7 a m  on the morning of May 11th  the Corps of Cadets  consisting of a battalion of four companies of infantry and a section of 3 inch rifled guns  took up the line of march for Staunton  The march to Staunton was accomplished in two days  I preceded the column on the second day some hours for the purpose of reporting to General Breckinridge  and was ordered by him to put the Cadets in camp one mile south of Staunton  On the morning of the 13th  I received orders to march at daylight on the road to Harrisonburg  taking position in the column in the rear of Echols s Brigade  We marched eighteen miles and encamped  moved at daylight on the 14th  marched sixteen miles and encamped  At 1 o clock on the night of the 14th received orders to prepare to march immediately  without beat of drums and as noiselessly as possible  We moved from camp at 1 30 o clock  taking position in the general column in rear of Echols s Brigade  being followed by the column of artillery under the command of Major McLaughlin  Having accomplished a distance of six miles  and approached the position of the enemy  as indicated by occasional skirmishing with his pickets in front  a halt was called  and we remained on the side of the road two or three hours in the midst of a heavy fall of rain  The General having determined to receive the attack of the enemy  made his dispositions for battle  posting the Corps in reserve  He informed me that he did not wish to put the cadets in if he could avoid it  but that should occasion require it he would use them very freely  He was also pleased to express his confidence in them  and I am happy to believe that his expectations were not disappointed  for when the tug of battle came they bore themselves gallantly and well  The enemy not making the attack as was anticipated  and not advancing as rapidly as was desired  the line was deployed into column and the advance resumed  Here I was informed by one of General

Lieutenant Colonel and Commandant  Major General F H  Smith  Superintendent Headquarters Corps of Cadets  July 4  1864 Headquarters Corps of Cadets  July 4  1864 General  In obedience to General Orders No  21  Headquarters Virginia Military Institute  June 27  1864  I have the honor to submit the following report of the Corps of Cadets  under my command  in the field  from May 11th to June 25th  inclusive  In obedience to orders from Major General Breckinridge  communicated through you  at 7 a m  on the morning of May 11th  the Corps of Cadets  consisting of a battalion of four companies of infantry and a section of 3 inch rifled guns  took up the line of march for Staunton  The march to Staunton was accomplished in two days  I preceded the column on the second day some hours for the purpose of reporting to General Breckinridge  and was ordered by him to put the Cadets in camp one mile south of Staunton On the morning of the 13th  I received orders to march at daylight on the road to Harrisonburg  taking position in the column in the rear of Echols s Brigade  We marched eighteen miles and encamped  moved at daylight on the 14th  marched sixteen miles and encamped At 1 o clock on the night of the 14th received orders to prepare to march immediately  without beat of drums and as noiselessly as possible  We moved from camp at 1 30 o clock  taking position in the general column in rear of Echols s Brigade  being followed by the column of artillery under the command of Major McLaughlin  Having accomplished a distance of six miles  and approached the position of the enemy  as indicated by occasional skirmishing with his pickets in front  a halt was called  and we remained on the side of the road two or three hours in the midst of a heavy fall of rain  The General having determined to receive the attack of the enemy  made his dispositions for battle  posting the Corps in reserve  He informed me that he did not wish to put the cadets in if he could avoid it  but that should occasion require it he would use them very freely  He was also pleased to express his confidence in them  and I am happy to believe that his expectations were not disappointed  for when the tug of battle came they bore themselves gallantly and well The enemy not making the attack as was anticipated  and not advancing as rapidly as was desired  the line was deployed into column and the advance resumed  Here I was informed by one of General Breckinridge s aides  that my battalion  together with the battalion of Colonel G  M  Edgar  would constitute the reserve  and was instructed to keep the section of artillery with the column  and to take position  after the deployments should have been made  two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards in the rear of the front line of battle  and to maintain that distance  Having begun a flank movement to the left  about two miles south of New Market  the nature of the ground was such as to render it impossible that the artillery should continue with the infantry column  I ordered Lieutenant Minge to join the general artillery column on the main road and to report to Major McLaughlin  After that I did not see the section of artillery until near the close of the engagement  Major McLaughlin  under whose command they served  was pleased to speak of the section in such complimentary terms that I was satisfied then that they had done their duty Continuing the advance on the ground to the left of the main road  and south of New Market  at 12 30 p m  we came under fire of the enemy s batteries  Having advanced a quarter of a mile under the fire  we were halted  and the column was deployed  the march up to this time having been by flank in column  The ground in front was open  with skirts of woods on the left  Here General Breckinridge sent for me  and gave me in person my instructions  The General s plans seem to have undergone some modification  Instead of one line  with a reserve  he formed his infantry in two  artillery in rear and to the right  the cavalry deployed and guarding the right flank  left flank resting on a stream  Wharton s Brigade of infantry constituted the first line  Echol s brigade the second  The battalion of Cadets  brigaded with Echols  was the last battalion but one from the left of the second line  Edgar s battalion being on the left  The lines having been adjusted  the order to advance was passed  Wharton s line advanced  Echols followed at two hundred and fifty paces in the rear  As Wharton s line ascended a knoll it came in full view of the enemy s batteries  which opened a heavy fire  but not having gotten the range  did but little damage  By the time the second line reached the same ground  the Yankee gunners had gotten the exact range and their fire begun to tell on our line with fearful accuracy  It was here that Captain Hill and others fell  Great gaps were made through the ranks  but the Cadet  true to his discipline  would close in to the center to fill the interval  and push steadily forward  The alignment of the battalion under this terrible fire  which strewed the ground with killed and wounded for more than a mile on open ground  would have been creditable even on a field day The advance was thus continued  until  having passed Bushong s house  a mile or more beyond New Market  and still to the left of the main road  the enemy s batteries  at two hundred and fifty or three hundred yards  opened upon us with canister and case shot  and their long lines of infantry were put into action at the same time  The fire was withering  It seemed impossible that any living creature could escape  and here we sustained our heaviest loss  a great many being wounded and numbers knocked down  stunned  and temporarily disabled  I was here disabled for a time  and the command devolved upon Company A  He gallantly pressed onward  We had before this gotten into the front line  Our line took a position behind a line of fence  A brisk fusillade ensued  a shout  a rush  and the day was won  The enemy fled in confusion  leaving killed  wounded  artillery and prisoners in our hands  Our men pursued in hot haste  until it became necessary to halt  draw ammunition  and reestablish the lines for the purpose of driving them from their last position on Rude s Hill  which they   held with cavalry and artillery  to cover the passage of the river  about a mile in their rear  Our troops charged and took the position without loss  The enemy withdrew  crossed the river  and burnt the bridge The engagement closed at 6 30 p m  The Cadets did their duty  as the long list of casualties will attest  Numerous instances of gallantry might be mentioned  but I have thought it better to refrain from specifying individual cases  for fear of making invidious distinctions  or from want of information withholding praise where it might have been justly merited  It had rained almost incessantly during the battle  and at its termination the Cadets were well nigh exhausted  Wet  hungry  and many of them shoeless for they had lost their shoes and socks in the deep mud through which it was necessary to march  they bore their hardships with the uncomplaining resignation which characterizes the true soldier The 16th and 17th were devoted to caring for the wounded and the burial of the dead On the 17th I received an order from General Breckinridge to report to General Imboden  with the request on the part of General Breckinridge  that the Corps be relieved from further duty and be ordered back to the Institute  The circumstances of General Imboden s situation were such as to render our detention for a time necessary  We were finally ordered by him to proceed to Staunton  without delay  for the purpose of proceeding by rail to Richmond  in obedience to a call from the Secretary of War  Returning  the Corps marched into Staunton on the 21st  took the cars on the 22d  reached Richmond on the 23d  were
