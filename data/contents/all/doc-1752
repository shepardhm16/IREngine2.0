to the Keydet Club  The evening s highlight was the presentation of the Keydet Club s Three Legged Stool Award  For the first time in the 11 year history of the award  it was presented to two cadet athletes  VMI Wrestling Teammates Matt Brock  12 and Joe Munno  12   who serve as this year s Regimental Commander and First Class President respectively  Prior to the presentations  Cavallaro remarked   This is the 11th year the Keydet Club has presented its highest cadet athlete honor  the Three Legged Stool Award  The Three Legged Stool Award highlights a cadet s outstanding achievements in all three major areas of a VMI education  Academics  Leadership and Athletics  One of VMI s legendary alums  the late Giles Miller from the class of 1924  was the first to use the term  three legged stool  to describe VMI s well rounded educational mission  He said that all three legs of the proverbial VMI stool must stay balanced  If one was to ever get too long  it would upset VMI s special and unique educational system that has served this state and country so well since its founding in 1839  Cadet Brock becomes the first Regimental Commander  and Cadet Munno becomes the first Class President  to receive the award  The record crowd gave their enthusiastic support in an overwhelming ovation as the surprised young men took the stage to where they each received a formal resolution and a handsome Three Legged Stool Award  which were handcrafted by local Lexington artisan John Owen  Cadet Brock is on the Richard Y  AtLee  66 Annual Scholarship  and Cadet Munno is the recipient of the Ralph L  Costen Jr   70 Annual Scholarship  The evening s guest speaker  VMI Superintendent J H  Binford Peay II   62  was introduced by a former member of the VMI Board of Visitors and now current Keydet Club president William A  Paulette  69  The Superintendent reinforced the importance of athletics at VMI and how important it is for VMI s athletic teams to win and win  The VMI Way  In his remarks to the captivated audience he noted   The VMI Way  involves hard work  determination  teamwork  and that famous  never say die  attitude that doesn t accept defeat and never gives up  Another feature of  The VMI Way  and it reinforces the idea of  One Corps  is our insistence that there are no easy degrees for athletes  All cadets are expected to be serious students  not only because this is the primary mission of a college but because the experience and the knowledge gained prepares a graduate to enter careers that will be satisfying to them  useful to society at large  and will advance the wider mission of the Institute  Read Gen  Peay s Remarks The Keydet Club hails this Scholarship Recognition Banquet as one of the best ever  and they look forward to having an

use the term  three legged stool  to describe VMI s well rounded educational mission  He said that all three legs of the proverbial VMI stool must stay balanced  If one was to ever get too long  it would upset VMI s special and unique educational system that has served this state and country so well since its founding in 1839  Cadet Brock becomes the first Regimental Commander  and Cadet Munno becomes the first Class President  to receive the award  The record crowd gave their enthusiastic support in an overwhelming ovation as the surprised young men took the stage to where they each received a formal resolution and a handsome Three Legged Stool Award  which were handcrafted by local Lexington artisan John Owen  Cadet Brock is on the Richard Y  AtLee  66 Annual Scholarship  and Cadet Munno is the recipient of the Ralph L  Costen Jr   70 Annual Scholarship  The evening s guest speaker  VMI Superintendent J H  Binford Peay II   62  was introduced by a former member of the VMI

win and win  The VMI Way  In his remarks to the captivated audience he noted   The VMI Way  involves hard work  determination  teamwork  and that famous  never say die  attitude that doesn t accept defeat and never gives up  Another feature of  The VMI Way  and it reinforces the idea of  One Corps  is our insistence that there are no easy degrees for athletes  All cadets are expected to be serious students  not only because this is the primary mission of a college but because the experience and the knowledge gained prepares a graduate to enter careers that will be satisfying to them
