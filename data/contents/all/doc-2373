concepts that were once the stuff of science fiction this summer through internships at the NASA research facility at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton  Va  Paige Nardozzo and Jonathan Reardon  both 1st Class cadets  were the first mechanical engineering majors from VMI in recent memory to be selected for participation in the Langley Areospace Research Summer Scholars program  said Col  Joe Blandino  professor of mechanical engineering  Blandino  whose ties to NASA and Langley go back to his graduate school days in the early 1990s  said that the LARSS program has space for approximately 100 interns each summer and typically receives applications from 400 to 500 students   LARSS  is one of the most prestigious internships in the country  said Blandino  He added that he encouraged Nardozzo and Reardon to apply because of their strong interest in attending graduate school in aerospace engineering   Those are the students you want to get at Langley because it exposes them to world class research  Blandino noted  Both Nardozzo and Reardon worked in the structural dynamics branch of the NASA research directorate  Nardozzo s summer project involved making a small scale heliogyro  which is a type of solar sail powered by blades that spin like a helicopter s  She tested her creation in an eight inch vacuum tube  with a video camera capturing the spinning of the blades  Once the results of the small scale heliogyro are analyzed  she said  they can be extrapolated to help develop a control system for the blades of a full size heliogyro  Nardozzo explained   A solar sail uses the radiation pressure from the sun to generate thrust  therefore  it is  limited only by the lifetime of the sail film in the space environment  unlike other spacecraft that rely on chemical propulsion  She noted that solar sails would make much more affordable many missions that are now prohibitively expensive   For example  a sail craft placed between Earth and the sun could enhance solar storm early warning and help protect the nation s space assets  she noted   Further down the road  sails offer the prospect of inexpensive  reusable cargo transport to Mars and beyond  Nardozzo  a native of Spring Mills  Pa  chose to study engineering at VMI because she d enjoyed math and science so much in high school and she wanted an opportunity to design things for the future  Reardon  meanwhile  was assigned a slightly different project  but one also relating to solar energy  He was working on solar arrays  which capture sunlight and turn it into energy  He noted   I   was given a preliminary design of a solar array to be deployed from a spacecraft with a set deployment motion and had to find and design mechanisms that could be used for this deployment  Reardon also used a computer program called Abaqus to analyze how the array would behave with certain types of structural loads during a mission  Like Nardozzo  Reardon followed his interests in math and science to the engineering department   but he began his cadetship as a civil engineer  only switching to mechanical engineering at the beginning of his 2nd Class year  An interest in aerospace engineering was behind the switch  and  also like Nardozzo  Reardon now hopes to attend graduate school in that field  Over the summer  Blandino pursued his own research for Langley  as an extension of a project he began while on sabbatical from VMI in the fall of 2012   I ve been developing a dynamic model of the deployment of a solar array  Blandino explained  Blandino noted that VMI s reputation for producing strong engineering candidates was undoubtedly a factor in getting both cadets accepted in the LARSS program  An inside connection helped  too  Jay Warren  an analyst in the structural dynamics branch at Langley  has a brother  Jason Stephenson  02  who is a VMI alumnus   People know our product  said Blandino    and that helps  And I think our  cadets  presented themselves very well  I couldn t have been any happier with how they performed    Next year  we re hoping NASA will look for VMI  cadets  first  By Mary Price IR   Sept  2013 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
