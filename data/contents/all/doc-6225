facilitates alternating merge patterns between two arriving traffic streams  The key feature of the Joint Merge design is its two sided taper in which both approach lanes are reduced simultaneously

signs and lights mounted to a portable trailer  The AFDs can be remotely controlled and inform approaching drivers when it is safe to travel through a work area  One of the main benefits of the AFD is that it frees workers  that might otherwise be manually flagging vehicles  from hazardous areas of high traffic  Additionally  more workers are able to devote attention to construction related tasks

pollutants already in the atmosphere  carbon dioxide CO2  carbon monoxide CO  nitrous oxides NOx  sulfuric oxides SOx  and particulate material PM2 5  Of these  CO2 is the most heavily produces by roadway vehicles  The extent to which these pollutants affect individual neighborhoods or small localities is unknown since most emission measurements are taken at stationary towers whose area of measurement may not extend to the area of analysis  nor may it be representative of the area since the emission footprint groups all observed data into one output  Thusly  the real health threat associated with traffic increases near communities cannot be accurately projected without measurements specific to that area  Personality Traits and Travel Behavior The future and quality of transportation infrastructures rely heavily on the predictability of travel  To date  it is not fully understood how travel decisions are affected by personality or if personality is a viable option for predicting immediate travel  but the ability to grasp and apply this concept could lead to reliable predictions of real time travel  Imagine being able to use a low cost personality inventory to predict how the traveling public responds to an unexpected event such as a car crash or snowstorm  Now imagine using that information to estimate when and where congestion is likely to occur  Research on these possibilities is currently underway  Innovative Roadway Alignments   Sometimes small cities outgrow the transportation facilities available to them  Traffic officials have tried to control

Research Work Zone Traffic Control and Operations The  Joint Merge  is a new traffic control design that facilitates alternating merge patterns between two arriving traffic streams  The key feature of the Joint Merge design is its two sided taper in which both approach lanes are reduced simultaneously into a single lane  thereby  eliminating an assigned lane priority  This is thought to improve traffic operations by reducing queue lengths  improving driver satisfaction  increasing capacity and decreasing the need for excessive weaving  Automated Flagging Devices Automated flagging devices are of particular interest to workers who operate in work zones  Most consist of a stop slow paddle  signs and lights mounted to a portable trailer  The AFDs can be remotely controlled and inform approaching drivers when it is safe to travel through a work area  One of the main benefits of the AFD is that it frees workers  that might otherwise be manually flagging vehicles  from hazardous areas of high traffic  Additionally  more workers are able to devote attention to construction related tasks and improve efficiency  Modeling Small Scale Vehicle Emissions While the anticipated spike in transportation facilities is exciting to some  the underlying effect of this increase is not getting as much attention  An increase in travel lanes will result in more usage and most likely increase vehicular emissions within a particular area  Vehicle emissions expel a portion of the following pollutants already in the atmosphere  carbon dioxide CO2  carbon monoxide CO  nitrous oxides NOx  sulfuric oxides SOx  and particulate material PM2 5  Of these  CO2 is the most heavily produces by roadway vehicles  The extent to which these pollutants affect individual neighborhoods or small localities is unknown since most emission measurements are taken at stationary towers whose area of measurement may not extend to the area of analysis  nor may it be representative of the area since the emission footprint groups all observed data into one output  Thusly  the real health threat associated with traffic increases near communities cannot be accurately projected without measurements specific to that area  Personality Traits and Travel Behavior The future and quality of transportation infrastructures rely heavily on the predictability of travel  To date  it is not fully understood how travel decisions are affected by personality or if personality is a viable option for predicting immediate travel  but the ability to grasp and apply this concept could lead to reliable predictions of real time travel  Imagine being able to use a low cost personality inventory to predict how the traveling public responds to an unexpected event such as a car crash or snowstorm  Now imagine using that information to estimate when and where congestion is likely to occur  Research on these possibilities is currently underway  Innovative Roadway Alignments   Sometimes small cities outgrow the transportation facilities available to them  Traffic officials have tried to control for this by optimizing signal timing and increasing the number of lanes  However  these adjustments are not expected to fully address the growing problem and are sometimes limited by existing space  Although the main corridors  traveled by many during peak hour  were designed to serve as minor arterial roadways  many serve volumes suitable for major arterials  Thus  properly managing them is of high priority  Intersections are a key concern since they are areas of high conflicting movements where two or more roadways meet  In recent times  intersections  and the roadways leading to them  have been modified using innovative design techniques  Researchers and designers alike are continually
