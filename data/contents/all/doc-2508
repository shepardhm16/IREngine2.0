Safe Location New Lab Offers Safe Location for Structures Testing There s an old saying that what goes up must come down  But when it comes to structures testing  an integral part of the civil engineering curriculum at VMI  having things come down safely is of utmost importance  This summer  VMI s civil and environmental engineering department opened its Built Environment Assessment and Modeling Lab  more commonly known as the BEAM lab  in Morgan Hall  the annex to Nichols Engineering Building  Coordinating the project were Col  Charles  Chuck  Newhouse  professor of civil and environmental engineering  and Maj  Matt Swenty  assistant professor in the same department  Newhouse and Swenty explained that for the past several years  civil and environmental engineering majors had struggled to find a place for to test weight bearing structures  At the same time  professors in the department had no dedicated facility where they could safely demonstrate engineering principles for their students   The big need we saw was to get something where we could test safely  said Swenty  Luckily  neither Newhouse nor Swenty had to look far before they found just what they needed  an 18 by 13 foot section of a much larger room that was designed and built in the mid 1960s specifically for structures testing  In recent years  the area had been used by the mechanical engineering department for a variety of projects  With walls two feet thick  and a floor three feet thick  plus over 150 anchors for holding beams and columns  the spot Newhouse and Swenty found was ideal for their purposes  Testing is much safer in this room than in classrooms or other labs because energy is directed towards the floor  with its thick layer of concrete  said Newhouse  Among the classes that will be using the lab most extensively are CEE 301  Structures Theory  and CEE 327  Reinforced Concrete  but both professors stressed that they hope all cadets in their department will benefit  Cadet research  should benefit from the new lab   and in fact  it already has  The lab was still being refurbished this summer when Cadet Jacob Freeman  15 moved his materials in to work on a project testing new ways to reinforce the joints on bridge decks  That project was conducted under the auspices of the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute for an outside client  the Virginia Department of Transportation s research division   Freeman s project  couldn t have been done without the lab  said Swenty   We wouldn t have been able to load down like that  certainly not safely  Funding for the lab s refurbishment came from the Jackson Hope Fund  which supplied a grant of just over  40 000 for a steel frame to hold the structures being tested  Newhouse and Swenty designed the frame themselves  which was then fabricated by Jeff Parrent  lab mechanic for civil and environmental engineering  and Marco Floyd  lab mechanic for mechanical engineering   They were a big part of this project  said Newhouse  Both Swenty and Newhouse noted that the need for a dedicated structures lab was especially acute because the number of civil and environmental engineering majors at VMI has grown by approximately 50 percent in the last three years   We hope to use it for a lot of classes  said Newhouse   We re slowly trying to get more demos and labs in our classes  This just gives us a great space  By  Mary Price IR   Oct  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non
