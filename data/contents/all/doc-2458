Project When he commissioned into the U S  Army on May 15  J P  Hansen  14 entered the service with a clear understanding not only of the many lessons that history has to teach a future Army officer  but also of the process a historian uses to understand the past  In early May  after a year and a half of work  Hansen defended his honors thesis   Armed Social Work  U S  Army Special Forces in Vietnam  1961 1963  Hansen s adviser and mentor was Lt  Col  Brad Coleman  95  holder of the George J  Collins Sr  Chair in Military History and director of the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History   I ve always had an interest in the Vietnam War and the Green Berets in particular  said Hansen of his choice of thesis topic  To find primary sources  he and Coleman traveled together in the summer of 2013 to the National Archives at College Park  Md  and the U S  Army Military History Institute in Carlisle  Pa  From there  they were able to identify key individuals who were serving in Vietnam during the time period covered by Hansen s thesis  and Hansen was able interview many of those individuals by phone or email   Coleman  is a very skilled historian  said Hansen   He guided me toward what I needed to look for  Hansen went on to say that thanks to his thesis work  he has a much greater understanding of how a historian works  He admitted that before he began his thesis  he thought historical research largely consisted in pulling books off of library shelves and reading them   But  Coleman  really showed me a different view of history  which is through the primary documentation  Hansen said   You need to balance it with the secondary sources  Coleman  who served as staff historian for the Department of Defense s U S  Southern Command before coming to VMI in 2012  said he was pleased to see Hansen develop as a historian and scholar   His thesis is  a project based in primary source materials  said Coleman   It s a very good piece of historical research and investigation that s very well presented and organized and packaged  After graduation  Hansen reported to Ft  Benning  Ga  to complete the Infantry Officer Basic Leadership Course  Following that  he ll head to Army Ranger School and then report to his first duty station  Ft  Wainwright  Alaska  Coleman  meanwhile  is glad to see Hansen lay the groundwork now for a solid understanding of history and historical application  as the epilogue to his thesis reflected on the parallels between the Vietnam War and the U S led war in Afghanistan following the Sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  Recalling his time with the U S  Southern Command  Coleman noted   The most successful combatant commanders   were those that understood the importance of history and culture and language  I know when  Hansen  reaches that stage he will understand the importance of history and the utility of history  By  Mary Price IR   June 2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI
