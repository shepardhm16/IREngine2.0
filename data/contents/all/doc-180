history  As America celebrates Veteran s Day  and VMI marks its 175th anniversary with a host of events  another important anniversary passed this weekend  the 25 year anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall  The event was marked in Berlin with a ceremony  balloons  and speeches by Angela Merkel  current German Chancellor   and by the last leader of the Soviet Union  Mikhail Gorbachev  Former General Secretary of the USSR and the man who bears a lot of the responsibility for the wall s collapse  Mikhail Gorbachev  warned of the possibility of a new Cold War between Russia and the West  and criticized the triumphalist attitude in the West for the escalation in tensions  His speech reflects a growing rift between Russia and the U S  one that has coincided with Putin s consolidation of power in Russia since 2000  The 25 year anniversary of the Berlin Wall s fall has also sparked a reexamination among historians of the causes  For example  Mary Elise Sarote professor of history at USC and author of The Collapse  The Accidental Opening of the Berlin Wall  Basic Book  October 2014 wrote an op ed in the New York Times explaining  How the Fall of the Berlin Wall Really Happened  The National Security Archive put together key documents showing that the fall of the Berlin Wall  came about from accident and contingency  rather than conspiracy or strategy  The Adams Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis hosted a conference last week  The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs during the Reagan Presidency that focused in a large part on Reagan s role in ending the Cold War  Several of the sessions dissected the end of the Cold War  both from Reagan s and from Gorbachev s perspective  and the general scholarly consensus was that the Cold War was not an American victory  but a mutually beneficial negotiated settlement between the US and the USSR  or more specifically  their leaders Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  Ambassador Jack Matlock Jr  one of the architects of the negotiations with the USSR  spoke at the conference and ambassador Rozanne Ridgeway  chief U S  negotiator  chaired the panel on the U S  and the Soviet Union  Numerous other scholars  including Lou Cannon  James Wilson  US State Dept  Svetlana Savranskaya  National Security Archive  Jacob Kipp  University of Kansas  Beth Fischer  University of Toronto  and Archie Brown  Oxford University  directly addressed the end of the Cold War  Beth Fischer mentioned the importance that luck played in allowing negotiations between the USSR and US to succeed  and Jack Matlock Jr  stressed that the break up of the Soviet Union in late 1991 was neither a goal of US policy  nor was it anticipated by American policymakers  Unfortunately it seems that historians have been ignored  and today  the wrong lessons are being taken from the events of the late 1980s Many look at Reagan s famous 1987 speech where he said  Mr  Gorbachev  tear down this wall  and because the wall came down little more than two years later  assume that Reagan s rhetoric caused the collapse of the Berlin Wall  However  as argued above  historians have concluded that the fall of the wall was much more the result of chance   the East German leadership s ineptitude  Gorbachev s reforms  and the power and determination of East German protesters  The Adams Center strives to encourage innovative scholarship on the Cold War and to stress the utility of studying history in order to craft wise policies in the contemporary world  To summarize the main ideas of last week s conference  the enduring legacy of President Reagan is his determination to reach a negotiated end to the Cold War his belief and pursuit of a nuclear free world  and his ability to realize that his abhorrence for communism had to take a back seat to accepting the Soviet Union as a legitimate state  It is important for the American public  as well as policymakers  to start paying attention to these historical lessons  and more generally  to draw the correct lessons from history  Only then can more critical questions be effectively debated  such how the Berlin Wall s fall affected Europe  and how understandings of Europe are still being contested  for example on the battlefields of Eastern Ukraine and in Hungary s political arena     Note  For more primary sources that shed light on

November 12  2014 Research Permalink Reagan Conference Yields Key Insights The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security during the Ronald Reagan Era  a conference sponsored by the John A  Adams Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis and hosted by the Virginia Military Institute began today  It featured three panels that discussed various aspects of the Reagan Presidency  including his leadership  the national security establishment  and the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union  In addition  Adm  James Stavridis  USN  ret  delivered an engaging keynote address and Ambassador Jack Matlock Jr   ret  spoke during the evening session  In all  it was a fabulous day with scholars from around the world coming together to discuss national and international dimensions of security and leadership during the Ronald Reagan era Approximately 230 scholars  including 27 panelists or speakers  have converged to attend the conference  the first of its kind offered by the Adams Center  The Gillis Theatre  which seats over 300 on the lower level  was packed throughout the day as VMI cadets  scholars from around the world  and students from nearby universities converged on Lexington  VA  As a review of today s sessions  here are a few comments about each panel  Pictures can be found at a Conference photo album on the Adams Center s facebook page  Panel 1  The Leadership of Ronald Reagan Ronald Reagan s leadership style was a consistent theme  not only during this panel  but throughout the entire first day of the conference  His laid back approach and very loose control over his key advisers allowed for significant infighting within the administration  at times  yet did not mean that Reagan lacked a vision for the future  Whether this vision constituted a grand strategy  to end the Cold War was a main topic for discussion in this panel  On one hand James Wilson  Department of State  argued that Reagan s engagement did not constitute a  grand strategy  but rather a desire to systematically engage with Soviet leaders that led to the end of the Cold War  His co panelists  Lou Cannon  Reagan biographer  and Alan Dobson  St  Andrews University  stood by the idea that Reagan articulated a vision for ending the Cold War and followed through  and thus executing a  grand strategy  to end the Cold War  Keynote Presentation  Adm  James Stavridis USN  ret  Admiral James Stavridis spoke to to a full auditorium of conference guests and cadets  examining in detail the major security challenges of the 21st century  His main point  that the 21st century s security challenges will require cooperation on various levels  between governments  within government agencies  among private companies and public bureaus  in order to tackle the increasingly diverse and difficult emerging challenges  According to Stavridis  bridges lead to greater security than walls in the long run  and soft power is just as necessary  if not more  than hard military power to achieve security One thing that is sure  that the security issues of the 21st century will be very different from those of the 20th  Panel 2  The Organization and Function of the National Security Establishment Panel Chairman Paul Gorman  US Army  ret  headed a fascinating panel with Ronald Granieri  UPenn  and James Locher  US Army War College  that discussed various aspects of the national security establishment  Granieri presented a paper on Caspar Weinberger  Secretary of Defense for the majority of Reagan s presidency  painting the official as a dynamic player rather than dismissing him  as many historians  as simply an intransigent conservative hawk  James Locher presented a fascinating case study of the Goldwater Nichols Defense Reorganization Act as an example of transformative Congressional leadership that instituted what we take for granted today  integrated joint command in the US Armed Forces  Panel 3  The Soviet Union and the United States Ambassador Ridgeway chaired a dynamic afternoon panel that featured three compelling speeches that focused on the bilateral relationships between the US and the USSR  Col  David Glantz  a specialist on the Soviet armed forces  made the case that the interaction between American changing military doctrine and the failure of Soviet military reforms in the late 1970s and early 1980s played a key role in the political settlement that was reached by the end of the decade  Dr  Savranskaya  National Security Archives  spoke about bringing down the walls  giving a first person account of what was for her the end of the Cold War  Reagan s speech in Moscow on May 31  1988  For her  the growing trust between Reagan and Gorbachev and the elimination of the constant existential threat that the Cold War had created meant that the Cold War was no more  Finally  Jacob Kipp  UKansas  argued that the Soviet leadership during the late 1970s and early 1980s was  increasingly aware of its own vulnerabilities and limitations caused in part to an outdated thinking within the military industrial complex  Dinner Speaker  Ambassador Jack F  Matlock  Jr   ret  Day 1 of the conference came to a conclusion with a fabulous dinner and engaging speech by Ambassador Jack Matlock  Matlock reiterated what was said in panel 3  that Reagan did not claim to  win  the Cold War  nor did he desire to destroy the Soviet Union  Instead  the Cold War came to the end through negotiation  a process that was separate and from the break up of the USSR  In fact  Matlock identifies three distinct  although interrelated  phases  the end of the Cold War in 1988  the loss of control by the Communist Party of the USSR  and the break up of the Soviet Union  The dissolution of the Soviet Union was not an aim of the US policy makers  including Presidents Reagan and Bush  and that internal factors  not American action caused its break up      Day 2 of The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security during the Ronald Reagan Era conference was just as engaging as the first day  In the morning  three break out sessions ran simultaneously  focusing on international affairs during the Reagan Presidency  These  Reagan and the World  panels covered the Americas  Europe  and the Middle East and Africa  Finally  the participants returned to Gillis Theatre for the last session  titled  The Reagan Legacy  Students  VMI cadets and students from neighboring schools such W L  Liberty  and SVU  participated in significant numbers in every panel over the two days  Over five hundred VMI cadets attended the conference  along with handfuls of students from other universities  They got an invaluable opportunity to interact with nationally known scholars during the lunch and dinner sessions  In addition  they heard presentations by leading historians and policy makers  Two students  Salena Chiep and Austin Bajc  who both work as cadet assistants for the Adams Center  got a special experience and an in depth look at the process of organizing a conference    Panel 4a  Reagan and the World  The Americas Ambassador Paul Trivelli  ret  led a panel of three leading scholars on the Americas  Kyle Longley  Arizona State U  Evan Ward  BYU  and James Siekmeier  West Virginia U   Longley s paper addressed how significant Reagan s support of the Contras in Nicaragua had on his presidency  Evan Ward spoke about US Mexican relations  specifically relating to the Reagan administration s investments in environmental programs  James Siekmeier argued that the Iran Contra scandal was one of the most important constitutional issues of the 20th century  Panel 4b  Reagan and the World  The Middle East and Africa This session featured all local scholars  Francis MacDonnell  from nearby SVU  chaired the session and two VMI professors of international studies presented their research  Brig  Gen  Charles Brower discussed American involvement in Lebanon  while Col  James Hentz spoke about the Reagan administration s controversial policies in regards to South Africa  Col  Hentz argued that Reagan approached South Africa as part of the global war on communism  and his policies reflected colonial attitudes  Likewise  Brig  Gen  Brower saw Lebanon as part of the Cold War  when in fact  complex  internal factors led to the war in the early 1980s  Panel 4c  Reagan and the World  Europe Held in the George C  Marshall Library s Pogue Auditorium  this session was also chaired by the President of the George C  Marshall Foundation  Dr  Rob Havers  Three panelists spoke about the U S  relationship with each of the most important European powers  Britain  France  and Germany  James Cooper  Oxford Brookes University  analyzed whether or not the close relationship between Reagan and Thatcher should be considered a  special  relationship  David Patton  Connecticut College  discussed the strained relationship between West Germany and the US in the 1980s  especially as the US began thinking of withdrawing INF missiles  Finally  William Hitchcock  UVA  made the case that French president Mitterand s close relationship with the US was driven by a  sense of history  and that he staked out positions not always popular domestically  such as his staunch opposition of communism and support for intermediate range missiles  Panel 5  Reagan  Gorbachev  and the End of the Cold War Dr  Richard Bidlack  W L  chaired one of the most dynamic panels of the conference  one that featured a lot of cadet participation and questions  Beth Fischer  UToronto  argued that although Reagan did not  win  the Cold War  his legacy is that his radical vision for a world without nuclear weapons led the US and USSR to the negotiating table and led to the end of the Cold War  Archie Brown  Oxford University  focused on Gorbachev s vital role in ending the Cold War  Gorbachev represented a stark departure from past Soviet leaders  Brezhnev  Andropov  and Chernaev  being far younger and reform minded  He was also genuinely committed to both a negotiated end to the Cold War and internal reform to the Soviet Union  a process that eventually led to the collapse of the USSR    No
