VA  24450 Contact Miller Academic Center History of the Miller Academic Center John Clifford Miller  Jr  Class of 1928 In the fall of 1924  Cliff Miller entered VMI as a skinny 16 year old farm boy who stammered severely  He matriculated at this early age because his father  upon learning that his son ranked third in his class  encouraged him to skip his senior year at Brandy High School   Young Clifford neglected to mention that there were only four students in his class at the one room school  To prepare for his Rat year  Cliff attended VMI summer school at Rockbridge Baths  but he still faced many difficulties at the Institute  His speech impediment was severe enough to inhibit his ability to recite orally  and he endured the harassment and humiliation accorded in those days to cadets who couldn t speak up quickly  Early in his Rat year  he resolved to change rooms because he had to focus more on his studies than his roommates apparently did  His father s sudden death when Cliff was a Second classman was a major blow  Despite these challenges  Cliff graduated with a degree in liberal arts and the pride of a First Class Private  The VMI system had supported and strengthened him and instilled in him a love for the Institute that lasted throughout his life  His devotion to VMI actually was  at times  trying to his family  He interrupted his honeymoon at the Greenbriar Hotel in 1935 to drive the bride to Lexington to watch the Rat football team scrimmage  Luckily  Lizora supported him not only that day but every day in their 62 years together  Their devotion was mutual  and they were a dedicated team  After graduation  Cliff began a career at the Miller Manufacturing Co  Inc  a wood products firm that his father had started  He progressed from salesman to chairman and ran the company until it was sold in 1980  His tenure at Miller Manufacturing was interrupted only twice  when he earned his masters of business administration degree at the Harvard Business School and when he served in the Army Air Corps during World War II  VMI called on Cliff for leadership many times  and he always rose to the challenge  He helped to fund the first athletic scholarships at the Institute  he was founder of the Sportsmen s Club  now the Keydet Club  and he served as president of the Alumni Association and the Board of Visitors and as vice president of the Foundation  He helped many young men get into  and through  VMI  and he was always eager to help graduates secure productive employment  In recognition of his many contributions to the welfare of the Institute and its alumni  in 1972 the Foundation presented him with its highest honor  the Distinguished Service Award  Cliff believed in fiscally responsible government and the free enterprise system  and he supported these principles vigorously on the local  state and national levels  His other passions were his family  farms  the George C  Marshall Foundation  which he helped establish  and fox hunting  He threw himself into whatever he did  and his enthusiasm and determination were contagious  He was very moved when his wife and family initiated the J  Clifford Miller  Jr  Learning Enrichment Program at VMI in 1990  and he quickly began to support it himself  It is the most appropriate that this fund  added by gifts in his memory  support the Miller Academic Center  When Cliff Miller died in 1998 at the age of 90  he had lived a full and productive life that included many accomplishments in many arenas  However  it is most telling of the man that the only recognition he wanted on his tombstone was   President  VMI Board of Visitors  1954 to 1956  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT

John Clifford Miller  Jr  Class of 1928 In the fall of 1924  Cliff Miller entered VMI as a skinny 16 year old farm boy who stammered severely  He matriculated at this early age because his father  upon learning that his son ranked third in his class  encouraged him to skip his senior year at Brandy High School   Young Clifford neglected to mention that there were only four students in his class at the one room school  To prepare for his Rat year  Cliff attended VMI summer school at Rockbridge Baths  but he still faced many difficulties at the Institute  His speech impediment was severe enough to inhibit his ability to recite orally  and he endured the harassment and humiliation accorded in those days to cadets who couldn t speak up quickly  Early in his Rat year  he resolved to change rooms because he had to focus more on his studies than his roommates apparently did  His father s sudden death when Cliff was a Second classman was a major blow  Despite these challenges  Cliff graduated with a degree in liberal arts and the pride of a First Class Private  The VMI system had supported and strengthened him and instilled in him a love for the Institute that lasted throughout his life  His devotion to VMI actually was  at times  trying to his family  He interrupted his honeymoon at the Greenbriar Hotel in 1935 to drive the bride to Lexington to watch the Rat football team scrimmage  Luckily  Lizora supported him not only that day but every day in their 62 years together  Their devotion was mutual  and they were a dedicated team  After graduation  Cliff began a career at the Miller Manufacturing Co  Inc  a wood products firm that his father had started  He progressed from salesman to chairman and ran the company until it was sold in 1980  His tenure at Miller Manufacturing was interrupted only twice  when he earned his masters of business administration degree at the Harvard Business School and when he served in the Army Air Corps during World War II  VMI called on Cliff for leadership many times  and he always rose to the challenge  He helped to fund the first athletic scholarships at the Institute  he was founder of the Sportsmen s Club  now the Keydet Club  and he served as president of the Alumni Association and the Board of Visitors and as vice president of the Foundation  He helped many young men get into  and through  VMI  and he was always eager to help graduates secure productive employment  In recognition of his many contributions to the welfare of the Institute and its alumni  in 1972 the Foundation presented him with its highest honor  the Distinguished Service Award  Cliff believed in fiscally responsible government and the free enterprise system  and he supported these principles vigorously on the local  state and national levels  His other passions were his family  farms  the George C  Marshall Foundation  which he helped establish  and fox hunting  He threw himself into whatever he did  and his enthusiasm and determination were contagious  He was very moved when his wife and family initiated the J  Clifford Miller  Jr  Learning Enrichment Program at VMI in 1990  and he quickly began to support it himself  It is the most appropriate that this fund  added by gifts in his memory  support the Miller Academic Center  When Cliff Miller died in 1998 at the age of 90  he had lived a full and productive life that included many accomplishments in many arenas  However  it is most telling of the man that the only recognition he wanted on his tombstone was   President  VMI Board of Visitors  1954 to 1956
