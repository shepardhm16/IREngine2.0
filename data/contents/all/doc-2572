Launches Entrepreneurship Club Alumni Panel Launches Entrepreneurship Club VMI s mission statement encourages cadets to become  advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system  Richard  Ricky  Siewers  15 took that to heart this summer  After returning from a summer internship with alumnus Mike Lloyd  07  the 1st Class cadet went to work to begin the Entrepreneurship Club  He helped launch the club with a panel discussion in early November  followed by a membership meeting a few nights later   I ve been waiting for 15 years for something like this to happen  and he made it happen  said Col  Atin Basuchoudhary  a professor in the economics and business department   I m really excited  Siewers was just as excited when he got together with a group of interns during the summer  When he heard of all the stimulating activities they participated in on their campuses  he decided to bring the ideas back to VMI   They had all of these entrepreneur clubs  had the chance to start businesses while they were in school  said Siewers   I thought   Why couldn t VMI have something like that  He talked to Basuchoudhary and Col  Robert W   Bob  Moreschi  head of the economics and business department  about his idea  They gave him the go ahead  and after jumping through all of the necessary hoops  the Entrepreneurship Club kicked off with that panel discussion that featured three VMI alumni talking about their experiences in the business world  The panel included Robert Louthan  82  who has more than 30 years of business experience and is the founder and chief executive officer of VeteranCrowd  Richard Luck  12 taught in innercity high schools before starting UnBoundRVA  a company designed to help out entrepreneurs without resources  and James Goodwillie  12 is the founder of BlueBaggs  a social network shopping aid   Richard and James were two of my dykes  Siewers explained   I just reached out to them over the summer  and we brainstormed what we should do  I came up with the idea  of the panel discussion  as the marketing event for the club  to raise awareness  In that respect  the effort seems to have been successful  The night of the panel discussion the room at Scott Shipp Hall was packed  and about 50 cadets showed up for the membership meeting later that week   I had a lot of cadets come up to me and say how  the panel discussion  inspired them  said Siewers   They thought it was a great event  After the initial membership is trimmed down to between 20 25 cadets  the club will begin working on its agenda   We want to provide a place where we can teach kids the fundamentals of entrepreneurship  how to start a business and what it takes  said Siewers  who is heavily involved in the Cadet Investment Group and a member of Omicron Delta Epsilon   It s going to be a very alumni  professor oriented  cadet collaboration club where we re using all of the resources we have   What he s done with this club is to get a way to get our students to understand how business really works  said Basuchoudhary  who noted that the club was partially funded by the Charles Koch Foundation   Economics is ultimately about entrepreneurship  Siewers has contacted a number of alumni for a database he s building to be used as cadets begin developing ideas during club meetings  He has plans for even more guest speakers to come to post  and plans are in the works for a trip to Washington  D C  to attend 1776  a start up incubator developed by Matt Thompson  02  Meanwhile  the club will search for a place where it can meet regularly to discuss ideas and develop business plans  And fulfill that mission statement  By  Chris Floyd IR   Dec  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health

VMI s mission statement encourages cadets to become  advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system  Richard  Ricky  Siewers  15 took that to heart this summer  After returning from a summer internship with alumnus Mike Lloyd  07  the 1st Class cadet went to work to begin the Entrepreneurship Club  He helped launch the club with a panel discussion in early November  followed by a membership meeting a few nights later   I ve been waiting for 15 years for something like this to happen  and he made it happen  said Col  Atin Basuchoudhary  a professor in the economics and business department   I m really excited  Siewers was just as excited when he got together with a group of interns during the summer  When he heard of all the stimulating activities they participated in on their campuses  he decided to bring the ideas back to VMI   They had all of these entrepreneur clubs  had the chance to start businesses while they were in school  said Siewers   I thought   Why couldn t VMI have something like that  He talked to Basuchoudhary and Col  Robert W   Bob  Moreschi  head of the economics and business department  about his idea  They gave him the go ahead  and after jumping through all of the necessary hoops  the Entrepreneurship Club kicked off with that panel discussion that featured three VMI alumni talking about their experiences in the business world  The panel included Robert Louthan  82  who has more than 30 years of business experience and is the founder and chief executive officer of VeteranCrowd  Richard Luck  12 taught in innercity high schools before starting UnBoundRVA  a company designed to help out entrepreneurs without resources  and James Goodwillie  12 is the founder of BlueBaggs  a social network shopping aid   Richard and James were two of my dykes  Siewers explained   I just reached out to them over the summer  and we brainstormed what we should do  I came up with the idea  of the panel discussion  as the marketing event for the club  to raise awareness  In that respect  the effort seems to have been successful  The night of the panel discussion the room at Scott Shipp Hall was packed  and about 50 cadets showed up for the membership meeting later that week   I had a lot of cadets come up to me and say how  the panel discussion  inspired them  said Siewers   They thought it was a great event  After the initial membership is trimmed down to between 20 25 cadets  the club will begin working on its agenda   We want to provide a place where we can teach kids the fundamentals of entrepreneurship  how to start a business and what it takes  said Siewers  who is heavily involved in the Cadet Investment Group and a member of Omicron Delta Epsilon   It s going to be a very alumni  professor oriented  cadet collaboration club where we re using all of the resources we have   What he s done with this club is to get a way to get our students to understand how business really works  said Basuchoudhary  who noted that the club was partially funded by the Charles Koch Foundation   Economics is ultimately about entrepreneurship  Siewers has contacted a number of alumni for a database he s building to be used as cadets begin developing ideas during club meetings  He has plans for even more guest speakers to come to post  and plans are in the works for a trip to Washington  D C  to attend 1776  a start up incubator developed by Matt Thompson  02  Meanwhile  the club will search for a place where it can meet regularly to discuss ideas and develop business plans  And fulfill that mission
