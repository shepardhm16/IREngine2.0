Preston Library maintains a course reserves collection made up of materials chosen by faculty to support the instructional requirements of specific courses  Course reserves materials may be in traditional formats such as print or video or in electronic formats available online through the library s E Reserves service  Preston Library s policy for providing access to copyright protected materials through course reserves is based on the fair use provisions of United States Copyright Act of 1976  Title 17 of the United States Code  Section 107 of the Copyright Act expressly permits the fair use of copyrighted materials for teaching  including multiple copies for classroom use  scholarship  and research  This educational copying does not require the payment of a royalty or the permission of the copyright owners  provided that the circumstances of the use are fair use as determined by a consideration of four factors specified in section 107   A helpful tool to determine copyright is available here  The text of section 107 is as follows  107  Limitations on exclusive rights  Fair Use Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106  Exclusive rights in copyrighted works  and 106A  Rights of certain authors to attribution and integrity  the fair use of a copyrighted work  including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified in that section  for purposes such as criticism  comment  news reporting  teaching  including multiple copies for classroom use  scholarship or research  is not an infringement of copyright  In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include  The purpose and character of the use  including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes  the nature of the copyrighted work  the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole  and the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work  The  Fair Use Evaluator   http librarycopyright net fairuse  provides a way to understand and evaluate whether a use is fair under U  S  law  In this policy  Preston Library seeks to exercise in a meaningful way the fair use rights provided by the Constitution  as part of the balance between the rights of copyright owners and societal and educational interests in the dissemination of information  The following provisions apply to materials that are available on course reserves  including those that are scanned or downloaded to the library s E Reserves system  They do not apply to materials that are openly posted on the World Wide Web for which direct links are included in the E Reserves system or to links to electronic resources licensed to Preston Library  since their use is governed by licenses  The provisions below also do not apply to materials for which no copyright protection is claimed or to copyrighted materials that have passed into the public domain For assistance in determining the copyright status of materials  see the  Public Domain Slider  at http librarycopyright net digitalslider  The library will weigh the four fair use factors in determining whether the inclusion of the material in the course reserves collection is a fair use  If the use is determined not to be fair  the material will not be accepted  unless the faculty member obtains the copyright holder s permission    Material is included in the course reserves collection at the request of faculty for non commercial  educational use by students  There is no charge for access to course reserves materials  Material is included in the course reserves collection only if the library  the instructor  or another unit of the Institute possesses a lawfully obtained copy of the work    The course reserves introductory screen will include a notice consistent with that described in Section 108 f 1  of the Copyright Act  including additional language cautioning against further electronic distribution of digital works    Material included in the course reserves collection will include an appropriate citation or attribution to its source    The required copyright notice will appear on all material included in the course reserves collection  This includes the formal copyright notice found in the original  along with the name of the copyright holder and the date  The notice indicates that copying or distributing protected materials may be infringements  but that making one copy for personal study  scholarship  or research is permitted    Access to materials on the library s E Reserves system will be password protected and limited to enrolled students  faculty  and staff of VMI    Materials in the course reserves collection will be available only for the time period specified by the instructor in the reserve request  Materials will be cleared from the shelves and from online access at the end of each semester  Copying and scanning of copyright protected materials made available through course reserves services is an unsettled area of the law  which has not yet been addressed by the courts  Preston Library will continually monitor legal developments which may affect the fair use analysis of course reserves services to ensure its policies are in compliance with
