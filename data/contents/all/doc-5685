7207 F   540  464 7443 111 Smith Hall Lexington  VA 24450 U S  China  Africa an  Expanding Circle  Ambassador Johnnie Carson gives a keynote address    Photo courtesy of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2011   Ambassador Johnnie Carson said he doesn t believe media portrayals of China as some kind of Cold War rival to the United States in Africa   That analysis is wrong  misleading  and overly simplistic  said Carson in his keynote remarks Nov  4 at a luncheon during VMI s  The Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  conference   It s a mistake to say we are engaged in a new competition for mineral and petroleum resources  Carson  who is assistant secretary of state for African affairs with the U S  Department of State  acknowledged that the United States should follow China s growing role in Africa very carefully for a number of reasons  but cautioned against an  alarmist or apprehensive  response  especially since China s influence and actions in Africa vary from sector to sector and country to country  Carson also pointed out that China has developed relations in Africa in the diplomatic and political realm  but hasn t tried to establish a permanent military presence or undermine African governments  A more reasoned view of China would be one that recognizes the country s astronomical population and economic growth  and by extension  its logical need to procure energy resources and other commodities  Carson alluded to statistics from 1997 that put a  5 billion price tag on Chinese African trade  By 2008 that number was  107 billion  while in 2010 it had reached  115 billion  placing China just ahead of the United States as Africa s biggest single trade partner  Carson said  Since Africa is the  last global economic frontier  it s only natural for countries like China  among many others  to look to Africa for economic and political opportunities  similar to the way the United States considers growth in Africa a core foreign policy objective  What s more  Carson noted  the United States remains the dominant player in the development and production of oil in Africa  where China remains a relative newcomer  And not a single African country ranks as one of China s top 10 suppliers or import destinations  Oftentimes  China s actions in Africa are not in conflict with those of the United States  said Carson  noting that Chinese activities in Africa often center on infrastructure improvements in oil rich countries  while the United States favors education and human rights reforms  That s not to say the United States shouldn t anticipate challenges in future dealings with China in Africa  especially when strong U S  support for civil liberties and democratic reforms may lead to friction with China  which favors a  non interventionist  approach to foreign governments  China places its own economic and domestic interests over human rights commitments by African governments  Ultimately  the United States should  get over its fears and get involved  in Africa  Carson said   In Washington we will encourage more American companies to look at Africa as a new market  and we will tell our African counterparts to hold China to the same high standards they hold American companies  said Carson  who pointed out that American companies often strive to integrate local African workforces  while Chinese companies typically employ Chinese workers   I believe Chinese goals to strengthen African economic growth are in the best interests of Africa  China  and the U S  Carson said   It s an expanding circle  not a zero sum game   George
