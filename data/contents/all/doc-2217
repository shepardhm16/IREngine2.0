Oak Kimball High School  Next  I went on to the U S  Naval Academy in Annapolis  also known as  Canoe U  I studied Mechanical Engineering there and became a commissioned officer in the U S  Navy  Six days after throwing my hat in the air getting out of that place  I married the former MaryLynn Gresham  who had just graduated from nearby Marymount College in Arlington Virginia  where she was a nursing student  I then attended Nuclear Power Training and served aboard the USS Will Rogers  SSBN 659  If any of you are interested in the submarine service  or nuclear power in general  let me know and I can tell you some stories and   or answer your questions   unclassified only  of course    My last two years on active duty were spent as an instructor  training students in running the S1W prototype plant in Idaho Falls  Idaho  which was the Navy s prototype for the USS Nautilus  SSN 571  the world s first nuclear powered ship  It was in this instructor position that I confirmed earlier hunches that I had a desire to go into the teaching business   Before attending graduate school  I worked in the facilities design area at K I  Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette in the Upper Peninsula  I did the same type of work for the Michigan State University Physical Plant as well  designing construction projects  mostly having to to with heating  ventilating and air conditioning  Following graduate school  I stuck around the Michigan State University Department of Mechanical Engineering for six years as a temporary instructor while our boys finished high school  prior to joining the faculty at VMI      Family  During my graduate training  my wife attended medical school and is now a physician working in a private practice in Fishersville  Over the years  we accumulated a few offspring  namely 4 boys  and now two daughters in law  as can be seen here in the family photo  The guy on the right is Robert  the fifth   believe it or not  a graduate of the University of Central Missouri  who works with his wife  Amanda  as they are the recreation coordinators at an RV resort in Texas  Amanda is a Florida native and a graduate of the University of Richmond  The parents of the twins are David and Teresa  who are University of Michigan and St  Mary s College graduates  respectively  working for Thompson Reuters  financial sector in Chicago  Charlie is on the left and helps with the twins   Luke and his girlfriend Jess are in the middle and are graduates of Baker College and Ferris State University  respectively   Luke works for the IT department at VMI at the Barracks Help Desk   As you can tell by the picture  my wife and I do not have the genetic diversity required to have produced all of these guys  three of them were adopted from Korea  Charlie came as an eight month old baby and David and Luke came together as genetic brothers at ages 5 and 3  respectively  Our oldest son  Robert  however   came to the world in the usual way  as Harry Chapin would say  Fortunately they re all basically law abiding young men  Outdoor Activities  I ve always been involved with backpacking  running  cross country skiing  etc  Back in the 90s  I completed two marathons and then decided that running 26 miles gave a body too much of a beating  So I started to get more involved with lower impact sports like Triathlon and cross country skiing  You still get two or three hours  worth of aerobic agony out of the deal  which gives you your money s worth  but without all of the pounding  Since then I ve been in 20 triathlons and 20 cross country ski marathons but  after a ruptured disc in my back  I ve had to all but stop running  I still do the bike  swim and ski stuff though  I have also continued with some of those activities as the advisor for the Outdoor Adventure Club at VMI  Spiritual Issues  I grew up going to church every week  but I never really learned much there  By the time I graduated from the Academy and completed Nuclear Power Training  I still had pretty fuzzy ideas about who God was  or whether there even was one  During my time in Submarine School  we lived in married officer s housing on the submarine base in Groton Connecticut  as did quite a few of my classmates from the Academy  Some of them invited my wife and I to a Bible study at the home of a fellow USNA alumnus on base  I decided to go along because we didn t have much better to do and there wasn t much homework in Submarine School  It was there that I saw a big difference between the way these guys approached life and my approach  They read the Bible on a regular basis individually and worked hard at applying it to their lives  I decided that I was on the wrong side of the fence and that it was up to me to make a change  Since that time  I ve learned that I can trust God and that He is trustworthy  He never does things to torment His children  but only to help them and to bring them closer to Himself  I can t imagine where I d be now if it hadn t been for that sequence of events back at the submarine base  Certainly there are doubts that come along  as there are for anyone  regardless of what you believe in  For me though  one thing that always comes to mind is that  I can t look at another person and say that he got there by accident  The constant tendency in this world toward randomness  decay  and disorder  as described in part by the Second Law of Thermodynamics  makes the odds of us getting here by accident effectively nil  I guess I can say  then  that one of the biggest reasons I believe in God is that I can t swallow the theory of evolution  Afterall  theories are lower on the scientific food chain than natural laws  If any of this has caught your attention  I m always happy to talk about whatever aspects of these issues may be of interest to you and I like to hear your views too  Just come by my office or maybe send me an e mail memo sometime  I look forward to talking with you
