plane ride to San Antonio  Texas   and give a presentation at a national conference about how they built the Department of Applied Mathematics  first supercomputer almost entirely out of recycled parts  Traveling to the 2015 Joint Mathematics Meetings will be Ryan Poffenbarger  16  an applied math major  and Chris Siebert  16  who s majoring in mechanical engineering  Together  the two cadets arrayed nine desktop PCs to act as a single  high powered machine  capable of solving complex mathematical problems  Eleven more machines are to be added in the future  as soon as the wiring is upgraded in the room where the supercomputer is stored  Work on the supercomputer began in the fall of 2013 and was initially funded by a National Science Foundation grant that has since expired  Funding for the wiring upgrade will come out of the applied mathematics department s budget   It s cadet built and it s going to be cadet maintained  Maj  Randy Cone said of the supercomputer  which he s nicknamed  Rat  Cone  who is assistant professor of applied mathematics  got the project going when he noticed a large number of computers sitting in the hall one day  The machines were about to be sold at a surplus auction  but thanks to Cone s intervention  they were reassigned to the applied math department and repurposed for the supercomputer project   First   Rat is  a resource for cadets to be able to learn about highperformance systems  said Cone of the need for a supercomputer   Second  they need to learn to use the power of the system to solve hard problems  Poffenbarger first got involved when he held an internship in the applied mathematics department last year that was funded by the NSF grant  while Siebert didn t begin work on the supercomputer until the summer  At that point  neither cadet had extensive programming experience  nor had either ever worked with Linux  a free operating system preferred by many advanced computer users   There s an enormous amount of open source community software that we had to get used to  noted Poffenbarger  He added   It s been a very humbling experience  with lots of frustration  Persevering through that frustration  the cadets have come up with a machine that s a model of efficiency  Rat operates with a single machine acting as the  brain  that tells the others what to do  Once the master machine has been given an assignment  Poffenbarger explained  it allocates the task into smaller chunks and assigns each to a computer   These guys are just the workhorses  said Poffenbarger gesturing to the eight machines that receive their instructions from the master   The workers finish the problem and send it back to the master to consolidate the information and spit out your answer  Both Siebert and Poffenbarger said that supercomputers are typically used for complex problems with many variables   It s supposed to do very repetitive tasks  large iterations  said Siebert   The go to example for scientific computing is predicting the weather  explained Poffenbarger   Your weather prediction is null if you can t get it out there before what you predict is going to happen  Poffenbarger explained that getting an application to run on a supercomputer often involves changing the code   the instructions for the computer to follow   so that operations occur simultaneously instead of one at a time   When you have nine computers  it s not as simple as just clicking on a program and saying   I want this to run on nine computers  he said   You have to go very deep into the inherent nature of the code that application was written in and you have to change things around  Despite the frustrations   or perhaps because of them   the cadets have experienced the satisfaction of seeing Rat go from a collection of about to be discarded PCs to a working system   This shows you can use commodity grade hardware to achieve useable results  said Siebert   It uses all of the same principles that would be used in a high speed  business level supercomputer  Poffenbarger added   Its intent is to be used as a learning lab for cadets   interested in scientific computing  Those cadets  it should be noted  won t all be majoring in applied mathematics  or even computer and information sciences   We re not viewing this as strictly a mathematical machine  said Cone   It s more of a general use machine    We re thinking about this in inter disciplinary terms  By  Mary Price IR   Dec  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site
