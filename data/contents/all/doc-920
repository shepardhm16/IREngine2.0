Why We Do What We Do After graduating from VMI in 1997  I found myself diving into a job and looking for a place to call home  Accepting a commission in the U S  Air Force Reserves and working as an environmental consultant was fantastic  but my soul needed somewhere to breathe  I went on with my life  spending 8 years in the Air Force Reserves and working for almost 10 years before deciding that getting my PhD was next on the list  While working on my PhD at Virginia Tech  I came across many organizations and opportunities to provide field level engineering support in developing countries  I chose to work in El Salvador and Haiti  Nothing can prepare a person for what they may see in one of these countries and no experience can really compare to Haiti  the poorest country in the western hemisphere and only a 1 5 hour flight from Miami  However  one thing I found to be true in every instance of working with impoverished communities  my soul WAS breathing and I could literally feel my heart beating and growing for these people  Through my experience with international aid  I came across Engineers Without Borders at Virginia Tech  A nationally recognized  student run hodge podge of amazing faculty and hard working students interested only in making the world a better place and how they could do it  This happened in 2006  In 2010  I was lucky enough to be able to come back to VMI as a faculty member of the Civil   Environmental Engineering Department  VMI CEE  As a 1997 graduate of VMI  I knew right away that EWB was perfect for VMI and that the VMI mission and the concept of the citizen soldier would fit in well with the EWB mission of providing impoverished communities with sustainable engineering designs aimed at meeting basic human needs  which by all accounts can be considered a basic human right as well  In December of 2010  VMI established a Chapter of Engineers Without Borders  Interest was impressive and in January of 2011  the program had a full Cadet administrative staff and a clear goal   clean water for the people of Pampoyo Bolivia  Through interaction and teaming with a local professional EWB Chapter  the group was able to hit the ground running  the next step recruitment Seven students strong  we knew we would need more interaction  and a collaborative program like EWB deserved to be shared with W L students Three students from W L immediately picked up on the idea and joined the VMI Chapter in the quest for water for the Pompoyan people  With a group of 11 strong  we worked countless hours together toward the next steps developing a clear implementation plan for getting water to the people of Pampoyo  Tweet 4 Comments October 31  2011 Blog Comments Eslye Moore November 1  2011 at 8 43 pm   Reply November 1  2011 Keep

sustainable engineering designs aimed at meeting basic human needs  which by all accounts can be considered a basic human right as well  In December of 2010  VMI established a Chapter of Engineers Without Borders  Interest was impressive and in January of 2011  the program had a full Cadet administrative staff and a clear goal   clean water for the people of Pampoyo Bolivia  Through interaction and teaming with a local professional EWB Chapter  the group was able to hit the ground running  the next step recruitment Seven students strong  we knew we would need more interaction  and a collaborative program like EWB deserved to be shared with W L students Three students from W L immediately picked up on the idea and joined the VMI Chapter in the quest for water for the Pompoyan people  With a group of 11 strong  we worked countless hours together toward the next steps developing a clear implementation plan for getting water to the people of Pampoyo After graduating from VMI in 1997  I found myself diving into a job and looking for a place to call home  Accepting a commission in the U S  Air Force Reserves and working as an environmental consultant was fantastic  but my soul needed somewhere to breathe  I went on with my life  spending 8 years in the Air Force Reserves and working for almost 10 years before deciding that getting my PhD was next on the list   While working on my PhD at Virginia Tech  I came across many organizations and opportunities to provide field level engineering support in developing countries  I chose to work in El Salvador and Haiti  Nothing can prepare a person for what they may see in one of these countries and no experience can really compare to Haiti  the poorest country in the western hemisphere and only a 1 5 hour flight from Miami However  one thing I found to be true in every instance of working with impoverished communities  my soul WAS breathing and I could literally feel my heart beating and growing for these people  Through my experience with international aid  I came across Engineers Without Borders at Virginia Tech  A nationally recognized  student run hodge podge of amazing faculty and hard working students interested only in making the world a better place and how they could do it  This happened in 2006 In 2010  I was lucky enough to be able to come back to VMI as a faculty member of the Civil   Environmental Engineering Department  VMI CEE  As a 1997 graduate of VMI  I knew right away that EWB was perfect for VMI and that the VMI mission and the concept of the citizen soldier would fit in well with the EWB mission of providing impoverished communities with sustainable engineering designs aimed at meeting basic human needs  which by all accounts can be considered a basic human right as
