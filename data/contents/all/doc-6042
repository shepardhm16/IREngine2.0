Mentor Faculty Mentor Project Description Project Description Locating a Low Lignin Glycine max Cultivar The purpose of this project is to find and isolate the ideal cultivar of Glycine max  soybean plant  for producing biodiesel from stem residues  The ideal cultivar would contain a low concentration of lignin  in stem residues  while at the same time containing high concentrations of cellulose and hemicellulose  To determine the amount of lignin  cellulose and hemicellulose in the cultivars  specific stem and branch samples from each of five cultivars need to be ground into a powder  Following grinding  each sample is placed into an acid bath to extract cellulose sugars and lignin monomers from the plant powder  In order to achieve proper results in the acid bath the powder
