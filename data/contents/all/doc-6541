Professors Train for New Research Project PE Professors Train for New Research Project A new project in the VMI education department could soon shed light on cadets  response to stimuli of all kinds  The project  which is part of VMI s new exercise science minor  involves using salivary fluid  rather than the traditional blood or urine specimens  to measure a wide variety of biomarkers  or physiological indicators  of an individual s health status   Research has substantiated the validity of using salivary fluid  which is perfect for a place like VMI because you don t have to be in a laboratory or a medical clinic  explained Col  Holly Richardson  professor of physical education   The beauty of this is that it s noninvasive  This year  the salivary biomarkers research lab will be located in Cocke Hall  while Cormack Hall is undergoing renovation  The lab  along with the other facilities and equipment supporting the exercise science minor  will move into Cormack Hall in time for the 2015 16 academic year  Funding for lab equipment has come in the form of a  17 000 grant from the Jackson Hope Fund  The original plans for an exercise science minor at VMI didn t include salivary marker research  but when Richardson read an article about it  she realized that such an initiative would be  serendipitous  to the minor  which was first offered in the 2013 14 academic year  As her interest grew  Richardson quickly recruited two other VMI faculty members to join her   Capt  Daniel Jaffe  an instructor in the physical education department  and Capt  Deanne Moosman  who has previously taught in the biology department but is switching to the physical education department this year  In early April  the three traveled to Tempe  Ariz  to attend  Spit Camp I  at the Institute for  interdisciplinary Salivary Biomarker Research at Arizona State University  At the two day camp  the three faculty members learned about saliva collection methods  including passive drool and cheek swabs  as well as the numerous insights into an individual s health that a salivary sample can provide  According to Moosman  salivary fluid can potentially measure approximately 1 000 indicators of health  but there are tests currently available for only 20 to 30 of those biomarkers  among them cortisol  a stress hormone  and alpha amylase  a digestive enzyme  At VMI  goals for the salivary biomarker research lab include measurement of cadet stress  Ideally  the results gleaned from that work would be used to find better ways of managing cadet life  Anecdotally  stress is everywhere at VMI  Richardson noted  but so far all of the ways to measure  stress are subjective rather than objective   Can we measure  stress  in an objective way  she asked  As one of the first salivary biomarkers projects  Richardson is interested in exploring the onset of the  barracks plague  that causes large groups of cadets to become ill at certain times of year  Noting that there appears to be a  slope of degradation  of the immune system  Richardson said that a salivary test could likely detect falling levels of immunoglobulin A  an antibody crucial to maintaining a healthy immune system  Knowing when levels of that antibody typically fall might prompt a change in the timing of some events  such as Rat Challenge and field training exercises  to better protect cadets  health  In addition to possible schedule changes  with increased and more objective insight into the physiological effect of stress on the body  Richardson noted   We can better understand from multiple viewpoints   that  cadet  experience and then either better prepare them or start teaching coping strategies  A more distant goal  perhaps timed for the 2015 16 academic year  will be measuring levels of nerve growth factor  a protein responsible for the growth and repair of certain neurons   I would like to position VMI to be right at the front in terms of testing that nerve growth factor because we think it may explain resiliency  said Richardson  She explained that nerve growth factor levels may be elevated in case of concussion  Jaffe  meanwhile  hopes to use the salivary biomarkers project to explore a professional interest of his own   the use of performance enhancing supplements  He s currently working on a dissertation about the effect of supplementation with beta alanine  an amino acid  on the athletic performance of college age males  Down the road  he d like to study the effects of such compounds as betaine  an amino acid found in spinach  and creatine  an organic acid that supplies energy to muscle cells   Hopefully  me completing this dissertation will then open up a school of research we can do on supplements  and we can utilize salivary biomarkers as a way of assessing large groups of individuals  said Jaffe  With all of these projects  the three faculty members are striving to keep the focus on cadets  and specifically on discovering ways to improve cadets  lives while at VMI   What do our findings say about our programs and how do we progress in that  Richardson asked   We re not a research or medical institution but that doesn t mean we can t do compelling inquiry  By  Mary Price IR   Sept  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index
