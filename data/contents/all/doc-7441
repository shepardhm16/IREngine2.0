24450 Undergraduate Research Symposium Continues Growth Institute Report  April 2010 Helping coordinate the Undergraduate Research Symposium for several years has been all in a day s work for Patricia Hardin  but this year  her role as acting director of the Undergraduate Research Initiative gave her a new perspective on an event that continues to grow in size and scope  Around 140 cadets presented their research at URS on April 1  some even shared their artistic talents in the second annual VMI Exhibition of the Arts held in conjunction with the traditional poster and paper presentations   I m extremely pleased with the success of URS this year  said Hardin   We had cadets presenting their work in just about every discipline  We even had a poster on Cadet Johnny Alerding s Air Force ROTC experience last summer  Hardin explained that for the first time the URS Steering Committee invited participation from the ROTC departments in an effort to bring that aspect of cadet life into the Symposium  She said their involvement will be encouraged at next year s URS  and she hopes participation in this area will increase over time   Serving as acting director of URI has given me a new appreciation for the work our cadets do to prepare for URS despite the hectic nature of spring at VMI  said Hardin   I ve also enjoyed the opportunity to work more closely with the members of the URS Steering Committee and to see firsthand just how committed our faculty is to undergraduate research  Another aspect of Hardin s role as acting director has been to look beyond URS to the future  which includes strategic planning  An external team of reviewers recently visited Post to assess the state of VMI s undergraduate research program  information that will help the Institute shape its future  Hardin said that she has had to look at additional avenues to generate external support for the Symposium and the URI that will add to the Jackson Hope Fund s generous and long time support of URI   Being part of the undergraduate research experience at VMI in a stronger capacity has been quite rewarding  said Hardin   I believe that when students get involved in an undergraduate research experience  they get to see the whole process from start to finish  They also get the opportunity to work one on one with faculty mentors  and a bond is formed that is quite invaluable to both student and teacher  Sidebar  2010 URS Awards Announced URS projects were evaluated by judges  and the following cadets received prizes for their projects  Liberal arts poster presentations  Matthew Sinkez
