Grade Policy Link to VMI s Spanish drills Link to Study Spanish com VMI Work for Grade Policy quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Academic Regulations Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  2  Faculty members  responsibilities Each academic department will publish an official statement of supplementary departmental policies regarding work for grade  titled  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade  Each departmental statement will include explicit policies on the following   a  tutoring   e g  Writing Center  Academic Center  athletic tutors  private tutors   b  peer collaboration  and  c  computer aids  including calculators  translators  spelling  style  and grammar checkers  Individual course assignments that deviate from the departmental work for grade policies must be approved by the department head in advance and must be explained to cadets in writing  No departmental or individual assignment policies may contradict or compromise the Institutional principles expressed in the Academic Regulations  particularly notions of academic integrity and the requirement to document borrowed material and help received  Each departmental statement must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty following review by the Academic Policy Committee of the Academic Board  A copy of the document must be filed with the Superintendent  the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  and the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  Such a statement must be signed by the department head and must be posted in each classroom used by the department  As an essential part of the duty of teaching and a matter of professional citizenship  faculty are expected to adhere to established work for grade policies and to communicate clearly and regularly with their cadets about the values and practices of academic honesty and integrity  Each faculty member must therefore include work for grade policies in a syllabus for every course he or she teaches  Each syllabus must include an exact transcription of the section titled  Cadets  Responsibilities  from  Work for Grade Policies  in the VMI Academic Regulations and a full statement of the established departmental policies regarding work for grade  plus any approved course specific policies  Furthermore  all faculty members are responsible for discussing with all of their students the details  definitions  and implications of  1  the entire section of the Academic Regulations entitled  Work for Grade Policies   2  the relevant sections on quotations  paraphrasing  and documentation in the current VMI authorized handbook  and  3  the departmental and any approved course specific policies regarding Work for Grade  This discussion must take place before any work is submitted for grade  and it should be treated with the gravity and level of detail that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the instructor s work for grade policies  he or she should report the evidence to the head of the department  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not have his or her work proofread or edited by someone other than the instructor   Instructors may grant exceptions to this rule only if they have received written permission from the department head for a particular assignment  ver  8 25 06 Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help  Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett Head  Department of Modern Languages and Cultures August 29  2008 SP 101 Course calendar Adelante UNO fall

that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated

collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge

advance  Click here for VMI Work for Grade Policy Click here for Modern Language and Cultures Work for Grade Policy Link to VMI s Spanish drills Link to Study Spanish com VMI Work for Grade Policy quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Academic Regulations Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  2  Faculty members  responsibilities Each academic department will publish an official statement of supplementary departmental policies regarding work for grade  titled  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade  Each departmental statement will include explicit policies on the following   a  tutoring   e g  Writing Center  Academic Center  athletic tutors  private tutors   b  peer collaboration  and  c  computer aids  including calculators  translators  spelling  style  and grammar checkers  Individual course assignments that deviate from the departmental work for grade policies must be approved by the department head in advance and must be explained to cadets in writing  No departmental or individual assignment policies may contradict or compromise the Institutional principles expressed in the Academic Regulations  particularly notions of academic integrity and the requirement to document borrowed material and help received  Each departmental statement must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty following review by the Academic Policy Committee of the Academic Board  A copy of the document must be filed with the Superintendent  the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  and the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  Such a statement must be signed by the department head and must be posted in each classroom used by the department  As an essential part of the duty of teaching and a matter of professional citizenship  faculty are expected to adhere to established work for grade policies and to communicate clearly and regularly with their cadets about the values and practices of academic honesty and integrity  Each faculty member must therefore include work for grade policies in a syllabus for every course he or she teaches  Each syllabus must include an exact transcription of the section titled  Cadets  Responsibilities  from  Work for Grade Policies  in the VMI Academic Regulations and a full statement of the established departmental policies regarding work for grade  plus any approved course specific policies  Furthermore  all

Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the

Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such

quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Academic Regulations Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  2  Faculty members  responsibilities Each academic department will publish an official statement of supplementary departmental policies regarding work for grade  titled  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade  Each departmental statement will include explicit policies on the following   a  tutoring   e g  Writing Center  Academic Center  athletic tutors  private tutors   b  peer collaboration  and  c  computer aids  including calculators  translators  spelling  style  and grammar checkers  Individual course assignments that deviate from the departmental work for grade policies must be approved by the department head in advance and must be explained to cadets in writing  No departmental or individual assignment policies may contradict or compromise the Institutional principles expressed in the Academic Regulations  particularly notions of academic integrity and the requirement to document borrowed material and help received  Each departmental statement must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty following review by the Academic Policy Committee of the Academic Board  A copy of the document must be filed with the Superintendent  the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  and the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  Such a statement must be signed by the department head and must be posted in each classroom used by the department  As an essential part of the duty of teaching and a matter of professional citizenship  faculty are expected to adhere to established work for grade policies and to communicate clearly and regularly with their cadets about the values and practices of academic honesty and integrity  Each faculty member must therefore include work for grade policies in a syllabus for every course he or she teaches  Each syllabus must include an exact transcription of the section titled  Cadets  Responsibilities  from  Work for Grade Policies  in the VMI Academic Regulations and a full statement of the established departmental policies regarding work for grade  plus any approved course specific policies  Furthermore  all faculty members are responsible for discussing with all of their students the details  definitions  and implications of  1  the entire section of the Academic Regulations entitled  Work for Grade Policies   2  the relevant sections on quotations  paraphrasing  and documentation in the current VMI authorized handbook  and  3  the departmental and any approved course specific policies regarding Work for Grade  This discussion must take place before any work is submitted for grade  and it should be treated with the gravity and level of detail that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the instructor s work for grade policies  he or she should report the evidence to the head of the department  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not have his or her work proofread or edited by someone other than the instructor   Instructors may grant exceptions to this rule only if they have received written permission from the department head for a particular assignment  ver  8 25 06 Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help  Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett Head  Department of Modern Languages and

faculty members are responsible for discussing with all of their students the details  definitions  and implications of  1  the entire section of the Academic Regulations entitled  Work for Grade Policies   2  the relevant sections on quotations  paraphrasing  and documentation in the current VMI authorized handbook  and  3  the departmental and any approved course specific policies regarding Work for Grade  This discussion must take place before any work is submitted for grade  and it should be treated with the gravity and level of detail that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the instructor s work for grade policies  he or she should report the evidence to the head of the department  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not have his or her work proofread or edited by someone other than the instructor   Instructors may grant exceptions to this rule only if they have received written permission from the department head for a particular assignment  ver  8 25 06 Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help  Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett Head  Department of Modern Languages and

advance  Click here for VMI Work for Grade Policy Click here for Modern Language and Cultures Work for Grade Policy Link to VMI s Spanish drills Link to Study Spanish com VMI Work for Grade Policy quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Academic Regulations Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  2  Faculty members  responsibilities Each academic department will publish an official statement of supplementary departmental policies regarding work for grade  titled  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade  Each departmental statement will include explicit policies on the following   a  tutoring   e g  Writing Center  Academic Center  athletic tutors  private tutors   b  peer collaboration  and  c  computer aids  including calculators  translators  spelling  style  and grammar checkers  Individual course assignments that deviate from the departmental work for grade policies must be approved by the department head in advance and must be explained to cadets in writing  No departmental or individual assignment policies may contradict or compromise the Institutional principles expressed in the Academic Regulations  particularly notions of academic integrity and the requirement to document borrowed material and help received  Each departmental statement must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty following review by the Academic Policy Committee of the Academic Board  A copy of the document must be filed with the Superintendent  the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  and the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  Such a statement must be signed by the department head and must be posted in each classroom used by the department  As an essential part of the duty of teaching and a matter of professional citizenship  faculty are expected to adhere to established work for grade policies and to communicate clearly and regularly with their cadets about the values and practices of academic honesty and integrity  Each faculty member must therefore include work for grade policies in a syllabus for every course he or she teaches  Each syllabus must include an exact transcription of the section titled  Cadets  Responsibilities  from  Work for Grade Policies  in the VMI Academic Regulations and a full statement of the established departmental policies regarding work for grade  plus any approved course specific policies  Furthermore  all faculty members are responsible for discussing with all of their students the details  definitions  and implications of  1  the entire section of the Academic Regulations entitled  Work for Grade Policies   2  the relevant sections on quotations  paraphrasing  and documentation in the current VMI authorized handbook  and  3  the departmental and any approved course specific policies regarding Work for Grade  This discussion must take place before any work is submitted for grade  and it should be treated with the gravity and level of detail that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the instructor s work for grade policies  he or she should report the evidence to the head of the department  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not have his or her work proofread or edited by someone other than the instructor   Instructors may grant exceptions to this rule only if they have received written permission from the department head for a particular assignment  ver  8 25 06 Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside

Language and Cultures Work for Grade Policy Link to VMI s Spanish drills Link to Study Spanish com VMI Work for Grade Policy quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Academic Regulations Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  2  Faculty members  responsibilities Each academic department will publish an official statement of supplementary departmental policies regarding work for grade  titled  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade  Each departmental statement will include explicit policies on the following   a  tutoring   e g  Writing Center  Academic Center  athletic tutors  private tutors   b  peer collaboration  and  c  computer aids  including calculators  translators  spelling  style  and grammar checkers  Individual course assignments that deviate from the departmental work for grade policies must be approved by the department head in advance and must be explained to cadets in writing  No departmental or individual assignment policies may contradict or compromise the Institutional principles expressed in the Academic Regulations  particularly notions of academic integrity and the requirement to document borrowed material and help received  Each departmental statement must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty following review by the Academic Policy Committee of the Academic Board  A copy of the document must be filed with the Superintendent  the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  and the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  Such a statement must be signed by the department head and must be posted in each classroom used by the department  As an essential part of the duty of teaching and a matter of professional citizenship  faculty are expected to adhere to established work for grade policies and to communicate clearly and regularly with their cadets about the values and practices of academic honesty and integrity  Each faculty member must therefore include work for grade policies in a syllabus for every course he or she teaches  Each syllabus must include an exact transcription of the section titled  Cadets  Responsibilities  from  Work for Grade Policies  in the VMI Academic Regulations and a full statement of the established departmental policies regarding work for grade  plus any approved course specific policies  Furthermore  all faculty members are responsible for discussing with all of their students the details  definitions  and implications of  1  the entire section of the Academic Regulations entitled  Work for Grade Policies   2  the relevant sections on quotations  paraphrasing  and documentation in the current VMI authorized handbook  and  3  the departmental and any approved course specific policies regarding Work for Grade  This discussion must take place before any work is submitted for grade  and it should be treated with the gravity and level of detail that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the instructor s work for grade policies  he or she should report the evidence to the head of the department  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not have his or her work proofread or edited by someone other than the instructor   Instructors may grant exceptions to this rule only if they have received written permission from the department head for a particular assignment  ver  8 25 06 Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help  Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett Head  Department of Modern Languages and Cultures August 29  2008 SP 101 Course calendar Adelante UNO fall

misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live  1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation  In all written work for grade  the cadet must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court  Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  2  Faculty members  responsibilities Each academic department will publish an official statement of supplementary departmental policies regarding work for grade  titled  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade  Each departmental statement will include explicit policies on the following   a  tutoring   e g  Writing Center  Academic Center  athletic tutors  private tutors   b  peer collaboration  and  c  computer aids  including calculators  translators  spelling  style  and grammar checkers  Individual course assignments that deviate from the departmental work for grade policies must be approved by the department head in advance and must be explained to cadets in writing  No departmental or individual assignment policies may contradict or compromise the Institutional principles expressed in the Academic Regulations  particularly notions of academic integrity and the requirement to document borrowed material and help received  Each departmental statement must be approved by the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty following review by the Academic Policy Committee of the Academic Board  A copy of the document must be filed with the Superintendent  the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  and the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  Such a statement must be signed by the department head and must be posted in each classroom used by the department  As an essential part of the duty of teaching and a matter of professional citizenship  faculty are expected to adhere to established work for grade policies and to communicate clearly and regularly with their cadets about the values and practices of academic honesty and integrity  Each faculty member must therefore include work for grade policies in a syllabus for every course he or she teaches  Each syllabus must include an exact transcription of the section titled  Cadets  Responsibilities  from  Work for Grade Policies  in the VMI Academic Regulations and a full statement of the established departmental policies regarding work for grade  plus any approved course specific policies  Furthermore  all faculty members are responsible for discussing with all of their students the details  definitions  and implications of  1  the entire section of the Academic Regulations entitled  Work for Grade Policies   2  the relevant sections on quotations  paraphrasing  and documentation in the current VMI authorized handbook  and  3  the departmental and any approved course specific policies regarding Work for Grade  This discussion must take place before any work is submitted for grade  and it should be treated with the gravity and level of detail that it merits  Faculty must also review the Institute policy regarding the discussion of quizzes and exams with their classes  Specifically  faculty must remind cadets that they are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam with anyone except the professor until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  If a member of the faculty believes that a cadet has violated one or more of VMI s  the department s  or the instructor s work for grade policies  he or she should report the evidence to the head of the department  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Deputy Superintendent for Academics and Dean of the Faculty  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  The instructor will assign a grade of  I  following a formal charge of an Honor Court academic violation in his or her course until the issue is resolved    Departmental policies must include a statement on whether tutors and peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not have his or her work proofread or edited by someone other than the instructor   Instructors may grant exceptions to this rule only if they have received written permission from the department head for a particular assignment  ver  8 25 06 Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned  Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help  Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services  Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett Head  Department of Modern Languages and Cultures August 29  2008 SP 101 Course calendar Adelante UNO fall

peers may offer cadets critical comments on their papers  Offering critical comments means giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  It does not include proofreading or editing  Proofreading means correcting errors  e g  in spelling  grammar  punctuation  It is the last step taken by the writer in the editing process  In addition to the corrections made in proofreading  editing includes making such changes as the addition  deletion  or reordering of paragraphs  sentences  phrases  or words  A cadet may not
