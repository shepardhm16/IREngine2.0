Horas de despacho  lunes  mi rcoles  viernes 2 00 Tel fono  464 7457 Course description    Spanish 303W is designed for students who wish to gain a command of spoken and written Spanish  This course emphasizes the refinement of previously acquired language skills  Whereas beginning and intermediate Spanish concentrate on basic grammar acquisition and the ability to communicate an idea correctly  although in a non native fashion  SP 303W seeks to embellish these skills further  As such  a high degree of proficiency and mastery level in both written and oral Spanish is expected for an average or better grade  The 3 day breakdown of this course will be as follows  Day A topics to be assigned  Day B In class discussion regarding world news and current events  especially information that pertains to your major  Day C In lab work writing and rewriting compositions with my help  Course goals The goals of this course are for each student to  Reach a level of sophisticated expression in written and oral Spanish  Broaden vocabulary and grammar  Improve pronunciation  Refine listening skills  through exposure to the language in and out of the classroom  Utilize correct grammar  syntax and a choice of words in a style appropriate for composition  Texts  501 Verbs  Christopher Kendris  any edition  A good Spanish English dictionary  Recommended Larousse  Many are available for check out at Preston Library  Useful links for news and current events Grading scale  The grading scale will be as follows  90 100 A 80 89 B 70 79 C 60 69 D 50 59 F Grade Distribution  Written compositions 30  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25  Daily journal 15  Final examination 30  Written compositions 30    Each week you will write compositions in Spanish  These are certified  Work alone  You may ask me questions and you may use references such as grammar books and dictionaries  and you must cite these at the end of the assignment  Composition defined  an original essay of 18 23 typed lines  of original material  written for the purpose of practicing grammar and rhetoric    The errors will be marked with symbols that should aid you in correcting the compositions  All compositions must then be corrected  revised  and resubmitted  along with the original  You will receive a grade only on the rewrite  You will be given a chart with the symbols that I use  After I return your original composition and you have made your revisions  count the number for each particular type of error and enter it on a spreadsheet  This way you can see your progress during the course  and thus know which areas still need improvement  You should track errors on all drafts of compositions  We will dedicate one in class hour per week to working on compositions  The topics from these compositions will be assigned by the professor and will include items such as those from the text  international politics  domestic politics  news  economics  ecology  social issues  leisure  sports  pop culture  and the arts  among others  Students are encouraged to submit editorials of a non VMI nature to the CADET newspaper  In order to help you learn about the topics above  you should browse various news links such as the Lanic newsroom  CNNenespanol com  SCOLA  http www maximum tv HomeTV broadcasts  and CNN en audio  OJO The grading of compositions and oral performance in this class will be assessed on accuracy  refinement  and assimilation of new material  Your grade will be determined not only on accuracy  but on your ability to incorporate new material  as well  You should be careful to avoid elementary mistakes yet  remember  that an almost correct  but sophisticated expression  is worth more than a safe but elementary way  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25    Language acquisition is an active skill rather than a passive one  You must learn to speak actively instead of responding only when prompted  On a daily basis I will evaluate your spoken contribution to the class  In particular  I am grading you on pronunciation  preparedness  quality and accuracy of your expression  I am also most interested in your incorporation into classroom discussions of more native  sophisticated expression as well as of new vocabulary from our text  Daily written journal 15    Cadets will keep an informal daily journal to be turned in once per week  on Wednesdays  Journals can be left and retrieved outside my office door  They can be handwritten or typed and are of an informal nature  meaning that there is not an assigned topic  unlike formal compositions  The goal is to encourage writing and new vocabulary growth Each Wednesday cadets will turn in journal entries that accumulate to at least a one page 8 5x 11 notebook page  regardless of how many entries are collected Grades will be assigned based on incorporation of  level appropriate grammar and vocabulary and attempts to broaden language usage and flow  If  penmanship is a challenge  then the professor may request that the cadet type the entries  I will not accept post facto or late journals  Make up  late policy    I will not accept any late  incomplete  and or illegible work  If you are going to be absent for guard duty  a VMI sponsored event  or a 3 0 cut  you may submit a composition or do your oral presentation early  You may also e mail these to me at the following address  Bulger BarnettKD vmi edu  If you are ill or on  last minute  guard duty  you may complete any assignments before the next class  and do your oral presentation at the beginning of the next class  I will not permit make up oral presentations for taking a day  or extended weekends  Final exam 30    Helped received clarification    Unless the work assigned is certified and specifically for a grade  you are encouraged to work together  For example  please work together on grammar review exercises from our text  At the end of the assignment  please cite the name s  of cadets with whom you are working  You should rehearse with one another any oral reports assigned  and critique each other  as well  Correct each other s grammar when you are speaking Spanish outside of class  VMI WORK FOR GRADE POLICY  quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers    Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once    Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live    1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned   Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement   In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation    Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration   When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help    Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology  In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services    Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc    Spanish 303W Composition Symbols   PRO omitted or superfluous pronoun  ex   le  Dieron a  l el libro  includes reflexive usage  PP incorrect choice of preposition  omitted or superfluous preposition  A Personal A  ex  No conozco  a  tu amigo  AX Accentuation  omitted or superfluous accent or other written symbol  such as the  u u      NAG Noun agreements  gender  number  or both with adjectives  also includes other noun centered forms such as demonstratives  possessives  pronouns  etc  G Incorrect gender assignment to a noun  F Form  often a regularized adjective  ex   una ni a muy  jovena  or the wrong form of a conjugation  ex  hemos rompido for roto  hablemos for hablamos in preterit  irregulars  and  for anduve  or stem changing   empeza  for empieza  WW Wrong word  incorrect choice or selection of a term  ex  banco for orilla or caja fuerte for seguro  COG False cognates  ex  embarazada  actualmente  etc  or non existent  made up words or expressions derived from English influence  ex  en facto for en realidad  SAG Subject verb agreement  ART omitted or

M Mood  incorrect choice of subjunctive  Indicative  or Imperative  A P Incorrect voice  i e   Active Passive  usage    1  If active change to passive  or vice versa   2  incorrect passive form  i e  se passive vs  ser passive  SYN syntax  i e  word order  Q omitted or superfluous  que  or wrong selection of  que  vs   quien   cual  etc  X Any basic grammatical error which the student should reasonably know  R Rewrite  or try another way of phrasing  you will probably have to consult me about sentences or phrases marked with brackets   which usually designate expressions that are too confusing to identify the error  or perhaps simply merit a stylistic suggestion  Others  STYLISTIC SUGGESTIONS   WC Word choice  Technically a correct selection  but better choice of wording or a better phrase should be used  ex  finalmente for por fin  also the incorporation of idiomatic phrases  ex  Estaba de mala uva  RD Redundancies  correct usage  but excessive use of the same word s  Consult the dictionary or thesaurus for other alternatives  or rephrase  Symbols may appear in the margin or above the error  When two or more errors are made in the same word  the symbols are joined with a hyphen  Ex  S   E M T   Ex  Espero que ellas ser n en la fiesta Espero que est n en la fiesta    Always find the error  correct it  rewrite it  catalogue it on your chart  and reprint your composition for regrading   Statement on disabilities  Statement on disabilities   VMI abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which mandate reasonable accommodations are provided for all cadets with documented disabilities  If you have a registered disability and may require some type of instructional and or examination accommodations  please contact me early in the semester so that I can provide or facilitate provision of accommodations you may need  If you have not already done so  you will need to register with the Office of Disabilities Services  the designated office on Post to provide services for cadets with disabilities  The office is located on the 2nd floor of the VMI Health Center  Please call or stop by the office of LTC Jones  Director of Disabilities Services  for more information  464 7667 or jonessl10 vmi edu  Guard duty and absences  Cadets  standing guard  are authorized to miss class  Those cadets who are simply  on guard  must attend class  In either case  if  an exam or other graded work is scheduled  cadets are expected to arrange a swap of guard duty  SP303W Course Calendar

means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current

command of spoken and written Spanish  This course emphasizes the refinement of previously acquired language skills  Whereas beginning and intermediate Spanish concentrate on basic grammar acquisition and the ability to communicate an idea correctly  although in a non native fashion  SP 303W seeks to embellish these skills further  As such  a high degree of proficiency and mastery level in both written and oral Spanish is expected for an average or better grade  The 3 day breakdown of this course will be as follows  Day A topics to be assigned  Day B In class discussion regarding world news and current events  especially information that pertains to your major  Day C In lab work writing and rewriting compositions with my help  Course goals The goals of this course are for each student to  Reach a level of sophisticated expression in written and oral Spanish  Broaden vocabulary and grammar  Improve pronunciation  Refine listening skills  through exposure to the language in and out of the classroom  Utilize correct grammar  syntax and a choice of words in a style appropriate for composition  Texts  501 Verbs  Christopher Kendris  any edition  A good Spanish English dictionary  Recommended Larousse  Many are available for check out at Preston Library  Useful links for news and current events Grading scale  The grading scale will be as follows  90 100 A 80 89 B 70 79 C 60 69 D 50 59 F Grade Distribution  Written compositions 30  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25  Daily journal 15  Final examination 30  Written compositions 30    Each week you will write compositions in Spanish  These are certified  Work alone  You may ask me questions and you may use references such as grammar books and dictionaries  and you must cite these at the end of the assignment  Composition defined  an original essay of 18 23 typed lines  of original material  written for the purpose of practicing grammar and rhetoric    The errors will be marked with symbols that should aid you in correcting the compositions  All compositions must then be corrected  revised  and resubmitted  along with the original  You will receive a grade only on the rewrite  You will be given a chart with the symbols that I use  After I return your original composition and you have made your revisions  count the number for each particular type of error and enter it on a spreadsheet  This way you can see your progress during the course  and thus know which areas still need improvement  You should track errors on all drafts of compositions  We will dedicate one in class hour per week to working on compositions  The topics from these compositions will be assigned by the professor and will include items such as those from the text  international politics  domestic politics  news  economics  ecology  social issues  leisure  sports  pop culture  and the arts  among others  Students are encouraged to submit editorials of a non VMI nature to the CADET newspaper  In order to help you learn about the topics above  you should browse various news links such as the Lanic newsroom  CNNenespanol com  SCOLA  http www maximum tv HomeTV broadcasts  and CNN en audio  OJO The grading of compositions and oral performance in this class will be assessed on accuracy  refinement  and assimilation of new material  Your grade will be determined not only on accuracy  but on your ability to incorporate new material  as well  You should be careful to avoid elementary mistakes yet  remember  that an almost correct  but sophisticated expression  is worth more than a safe but elementary way  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25    Language acquisition is an active skill rather than a passive one  You must learn to speak actively instead of responding only when prompted  On a daily basis I will evaluate your spoken contribution to the class  In particular  I am grading you on pronunciation  preparedness  quality and accuracy of your expression  I am also most interested in your incorporation into classroom discussions of more native  sophisticated expression as well as of new vocabulary from our text  Daily written journal 15    Cadets will keep an informal daily journal to be turned in once per week  on Wednesdays  Journals can be left and retrieved outside my office door  They can be handwritten or typed and are of an informal nature  meaning that there is not an assigned topic  unlike formal compositions  The goal is to encourage writing and new vocabulary growth Each Wednesday cadets will turn in journal entries that accumulate to at least a one page 8 5x 11 notebook page  regardless of how many entries are collected Grades will be assigned based on incorporation of  level appropriate grammar and vocabulary and attempts to broaden language usage and flow  If  penmanship is a challenge  then the professor may request that the cadet type the entries  I will not accept post facto or late journals  Make up  late policy    I will not accept any late  incomplete  and or illegible work  If you are going to be absent for guard duty  a VMI sponsored event  or a 3 0 cut  you may submit a composition or do your oral presentation early  You may also e mail these to me at the following address  Bulger BarnettKD vmi edu  If you are ill or on  last minute  guard duty  you may complete any assignments before the next class  and do your oral presentation at the beginning of the next class  I will not permit make up oral presentations for taking a day  or extended weekends  Final exam 30    Helped received clarification    Unless the work assigned is certified and specifically for a grade  you are encouraged to work together  For example  please work together on grammar review exercises from our text  At the end of the assignment  please cite the name s  of cadets with whom you are working  You should rehearse with one another any oral reports assigned  and critique each other  as well  Correct each other s grammar when you are speaking Spanish outside of class  VMI WORK FOR GRADE POLICY  quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers    Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once    Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live    1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned   Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement   In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation    Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration   When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help    Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology  In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services    Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc    Spanish 303W Composition Symbols   PRO omitted or superfluous pronoun  ex   le  Dieron a  l el libro  includes reflexive usage  PP incorrect choice of preposition  omitted or superfluous preposition  A Personal A

Journals can be left and retrieved outside my office door  They can be handwritten or typed and are of an informal nature  meaning that there is not an assigned topic  unlike formal compositions  The goal is to encourage writing and new vocabulary growth Each Wednesday cadets will turn in journal entries that accumulate to at least a one page 8 5x 11 notebook page  regardless of how many entries are collected Grades will be assigned based on incorporation of  level appropriate grammar and vocabulary and attempts to broaden language usage and flow  If  penmanship is a challenge  then the

once    Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live    1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned   Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement   In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation    Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration   When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help    Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology  In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services    Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc    Spanish 303W Composition Symbols   PRO omitted or superfluous pronoun  ex   le  Dieron a  l el libro  includes reflexive usage  PP incorrect choice of preposition  omitted or superfluous preposition  A Personal A  ex  No conozco  a  tu amigo  AX Accentuation  omitted or superfluous accent or other written symbol  such as the  u u      NAG Noun agreements  gender  number  or both with adjectives  also includes other noun centered forms such as demonstratives  possessives  pronouns  etc  G Incorrect gender assignment to a noun  F Form  often a regularized adjective  ex   una ni a muy  jovena  or the wrong form of a conjugation  ex  hemos rompido for roto  hablemos for hablamos in

reasonably know  R Rewrite  or try another way of phrasing  you will probably have to consult me about sentences or phrases marked with brackets   which usually designate expressions that are too confusing to identify the error  or perhaps simply merit a stylistic suggestion  Others  STYLISTIC SUGGESTIONS   WC Word choice  Technically a correct selection  but better choice of wording or a better phrase should be used  ex  finalmente for por fin  also the incorporation of idiomatic phrases  ex  Estaba de mala uva  RD Redundancies  correct usage  but excessive use of the same word s  Consult the dictionary or thesaurus for other alternatives  or rephrase  Symbols may appear in the margin or above the error  When two or more errors are made in the same word  the symbols are joined with a hyphen  Ex  S   E M T   Ex  Espero que ellas ser n en la fiesta Espero que est n en la fiesta    Always find the error  correct it  rewrite it  catalogue it on your chart  and reprint your composition for regrading   Statement on disabilities  Statement on disabilities   VMI abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which mandate reasonable accommodations are provided for all cadets with documented disabilities  If you have a registered disability and may require some type of instructional and or examination accommodations  please contact me early in the semester so that I can provide or facilitate provision of accommodations you may need  If you have not already done so  you will need to register with the Office of Disabilities Services  the designated office on Post to provide services for cadets with disabilities  The office is located on the 2nd floor of the VMI Health Center  Please call or stop by the office of LTC Jones  Director of Disabilities Services  for more information  464 7667 or jonessl10 vmi edu  Guard duty and absences  Cadets  standing guard  are authorized to miss class  Those cadets who are simply  on guard  must attend class  In either case  if  an exam or other graded work is scheduled  cadets are expected to arrange a swap of guard duty  SP303W Course Calendar

description    Spanish 303W is designed for students who wish to gain a command of spoken and written Spanish  This course emphasizes the refinement of previously acquired language skills  Whereas beginning and intermediate Spanish concentrate on basic grammar acquisition and the ability to communicate an idea correctly  although in a non native fashion  SP 303W seeks to embellish these skills further  As such  a high degree of proficiency and mastery level in both written and oral Spanish is expected for an average or better grade  The 3 day breakdown of this course will be as follows  Day A topics to be assigned  Day B In class discussion regarding world news and current events  especially information that pertains to your major  Day C In lab work writing and rewriting compositions with my help  Course goals The goals of this course are for each student to  Reach a level of sophisticated expression in written and oral Spanish  Broaden vocabulary and grammar  Improve pronunciation  Refine listening skills  through exposure to the language in and out of the classroom  Utilize correct grammar  syntax and a choice of words in a style appropriate for composition  Texts  501 Verbs  Christopher Kendris  any edition  A good Spanish English dictionary  Recommended Larousse  Many are available for check out at Preston Library  Useful links for news and current events Grading scale  The grading scale will be as follows  90 100 A 80 89 B 70 79 C 60 69 D 50 59 F Grade Distribution  Written compositions 30  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25  Daily journal 15  Final examination 30  Written compositions 30    Each week you will write compositions in Spanish  These are certified  Work alone  You may ask me questions and you may use references such as grammar books and dictionaries  and you must cite these at the end of the assignment  Composition defined  an original essay of 18 23 typed lines  of original material  written for the purpose of practicing grammar and rhetoric    The errors will be marked with symbols that should aid you in correcting the compositions  All compositions must then be corrected  revised  and resubmitted  along with the original  You will receive a grade only on the rewrite  You will be given a chart with the symbols that I use  After I return your original composition and you have made your revisions  count the number for each particular type of error and enter it on a spreadsheet  This way you can see your progress during the course  and thus know which areas still need improvement  You should track errors on all drafts of compositions  We will dedicate one in class hour per week to working on compositions  The topics from these compositions will be assigned by the professor and will include items such as those from the text  international politics  domestic politics  news  economics  ecology  social issues  leisure  sports  pop culture  and the arts  among others  Students are encouraged to submit editorials of a non VMI nature to the CADET newspaper  In order to help you learn about the topics above  you should browse various news links such as the Lanic newsroom  CNNenespanol com  SCOLA  http www maximum tv HomeTV broadcasts  and CNN en audio  OJO The grading of compositions and oral performance in this class will be assessed on accuracy  refinement  and assimilation of new material  Your grade will be determined not only on accuracy  but on your ability to incorporate new material  as well  You should be careful to avoid elementary mistakes yet  remember  that an almost correct  but sophisticated expression  is worth more than a safe but elementary way  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25    Language acquisition is an active skill rather than a passive one  You must learn to speak actively instead of responding only when prompted  On a daily basis I will evaluate your spoken contribution to the class  In particular  I am grading you on pronunciation  preparedness  quality and accuracy of your expression  I am also most interested in your incorporation into classroom discussions of more native  sophisticated expression as well as of new vocabulary from our text  Daily written journal 15    Cadets will keep an informal daily journal to be turned in once per week  on Wednesdays  Journals can be left and retrieved outside my office door  They can be handwritten or typed and are of an informal nature  meaning that there is not an assigned topic  unlike formal compositions  The goal is to encourage writing and new vocabulary growth Each Wednesday cadets will turn in journal entries that accumulate to at least a one page 8 5x 11 notebook page  regardless of how many entries are collected Grades will be assigned based on incorporation of  level appropriate grammar and vocabulary and attempts to broaden language usage and flow  If  penmanship is a challenge  then the professor may request that the cadet type the entries  I will not accept post facto or late journals  Make up  late policy    I will not accept any late  incomplete  and or illegible work  If you are going to be absent for guard duty  a VMI sponsored event  or a 3 0 cut  you may submit a composition or do your oral presentation early  You may also e mail these to me at the following address  Bulger BarnettKD vmi edu  If you are ill or on  last minute  guard duty  you may complete any assignments before the next class  and do your oral presentation at the beginning of the next class  I will not permit make up oral presentations for taking a day  or extended weekends  Final exam 30    Helped received clarification    Unless the work assigned is certified and specifically for a grade  you are encouraged to work together  For example  please work together on grammar review exercises from our text  At the end of the assignment  please cite the name s  of cadets with whom you are working  You should rehearse with one another any oral reports assigned  and critique each other  as well  Correct each other s grammar when you are speaking Spanish outside of class  VMI WORK FOR GRADE POLICY  quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers    Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once    Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live    1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned   Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement   In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation    Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration   When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help    Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology  In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services    Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc    Spanish 303W Composition Symbols   PRO omitted or superfluous pronoun  ex   le  Dieron a  l el libro  includes reflexive usage  PP incorrect choice of

probably have to consult me about sentences or phrases marked with brackets   which usually designate expressions that are too confusing to identify the error  or perhaps simply merit a stylistic suggestion  Others  STYLISTIC SUGGESTIONS   WC Word choice  Technically a correct selection  but better choice of wording or a better phrase should be used  ex  finalmente for por fin  also the incorporation of idiomatic phrases  ex  Estaba de mala uva  RD Redundancies  correct usage  but excessive use of the same word s  Consult the dictionary or thesaurus for other alternatives  or

despacho  lunes  mi rcoles  viernes 2 00 Tel fono  464 7457 Course description    Spanish 303W is designed for students who wish to gain a command of spoken and written Spanish  This course emphasizes the refinement of previously acquired language skills  Whereas beginning and intermediate Spanish concentrate on basic grammar acquisition and the ability to communicate an idea correctly  although in a non native fashion  SP 303W seeks to embellish these skills further  As such  a high degree of proficiency and mastery level in both written and oral Spanish is expected for an average or better grade  The 3 day breakdown of this course will be as follows  Day A topics to be assigned  Day B In class discussion regarding world news and current events  especially information that pertains to your major  Day C In lab work writing and rewriting compositions with my help  Course goals The goals of this course are for each student to  Reach a level of sophisticated expression in written and oral Spanish  Broaden vocabulary and grammar  Improve pronunciation  Refine listening skills  through exposure to the language in and out of the classroom  Utilize correct grammar  syntax and a choice of words in a style appropriate for composition  Texts  501 Verbs  Christopher Kendris  any edition  A good Spanish English dictionary  Recommended Larousse  Many are available for check out at Preston Library  Useful links for news and current events Grading scale  The grading scale will be as follows  90 100 A 80 89 B 70 79 C 60 69 D 50 59 F Grade Distribution  Written compositions 30  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25  Daily journal 15  Final examination 30  Written compositions 30    Each week you will write compositions in Spanish  These are certified  Work alone  You may ask me questions and you may use references such as grammar books and dictionaries  and you must cite these at the end of the assignment  Composition defined  an original essay of 18 23 typed lines  of original material  written for the purpose of practicing grammar and rhetoric    The errors will be marked with symbols that should aid you in correcting the compositions  All compositions must then be corrected  revised  and resubmitted  along with the original  You will receive a grade only on the rewrite  You will be given a chart with the symbols that I use  After I return your original composition and you have made your revisions  count the number for each particular type of error and enter it on a spreadsheet  This way you can see your progress during the course  and thus know which areas still need improvement  You should track errors on all drafts of compositions  We will dedicate one in class hour per week to working on compositions  The topics from these compositions will be assigned by the professor and will include items such as those from the text  international politics  domestic politics  news  economics  ecology  social issues  leisure  sports  pop culture  and the arts  among others  Students are encouraged to submit editorials of a non VMI nature to the CADET newspaper  In order to help you learn about the topics above  you should browse various news links such as the Lanic newsroom  CNNenespanol com  SCOLA  http www maximum tv HomeTV broadcasts  and CNN en audio  OJO The grading of compositions and oral performance in this class will be assessed on accuracy  refinement  and assimilation of new material  Your grade will be determined not only on accuracy  but on your ability to incorporate new material  as well  You should be careful to avoid elementary mistakes yet  remember  that an almost correct  but sophisticated expression  is worth more than a safe but elementary way  Conversational ability and daily speaking 25    Language acquisition is an active skill rather than a passive one  You must learn to speak actively instead of responding only when prompted  On a daily basis I will evaluate your spoken contribution to the class  In particular  I am grading you on pronunciation  preparedness  quality and accuracy of your expression  I am also most interested in your incorporation into classroom discussions of more native  sophisticated expression as well as of new vocabulary from our text  Daily written journal 15    Cadets will keep an informal daily journal to be turned in once per week  on Wednesdays  Journals can be left and retrieved outside my office door  They can be handwritten or typed and are of an informal nature  meaning that there is not an assigned topic  unlike formal compositions  The goal is to encourage writing and new vocabulary growth Each Wednesday cadets will turn in journal entries that accumulate to at least a one page 8 5x 11 notebook page  regardless of how many entries are collected Grades will be assigned based on incorporation of  level appropriate grammar and vocabulary and attempts to broaden language usage and flow  If  penmanship is a challenge  then the professor may request that the cadet type the entries  I will not accept post facto or late journals  Make up  late policy    I will not accept any late  incomplete  and or illegible work  If you are going to be absent for guard duty  a VMI sponsored event  or a 3 0 cut  you may submit a composition or do your oral presentation early  You may also e mail these to me at the following address  Bulger BarnettKD vmi edu  If you are ill or on  last minute  guard duty  you may complete any assignments before the next class  and do your oral presentation at the beginning of the next class  I will not permit make up oral presentations for taking a day  or extended weekends  Final exam 30    Helped received clarification    Unless the work assigned is certified and specifically for a grade  you are encouraged to work together  For example  please work together on grammar review exercises from our text  At the end of the assignment  please cite the name s  of cadets with whom you are working  You should rehearse with one another any oral reports assigned  and critique each other  as well  Correct each other s grammar when you are speaking Spanish outside of class  VMI WORK FOR GRADE POLICY  quoted from pp 24 26 of Academic Regulations  Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers    Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once    Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live    1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned   Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement   In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation    Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing  Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration   When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help    Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology  In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services    Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc    Spanish 303W Composition Symbols   PRO omitted or superfluous pronoun  ex   le  Dieron a  l el libro  includes reflexive usage  PP incorrect choice of preposition  omitted or superfluous preposition  A Personal A  ex  No conozco  a  tu amigo  AX Accentuation  omitted or superfluous accent or other written symbol  such as the  u u      NAG Noun agreements  gender  number  or both with adjectives  also includes other noun centered forms such as demonstratives  possessives  pronouns  etc  G Incorrect gender assignment to a noun  F Form  often a regularized adjective  ex   una ni a muy  jovena  or the wrong form of a conjugation  ex  hemos rompido for roto  hablemos for hablamos in preterit  irregulars  and  for anduve  or stem changing   empeza  for empieza  WW Wrong word  incorrect choice or selection of a term  ex  banco for orilla or caja fuerte for seguro  COG False cognates  ex  embarazada  actualmente  etc  or non existent  made up words or expressions derived from English influence  ex  en facto for en realidad  SAG Subject verb agreement  ART omitted or superfluous article  ex  Soy un alumno  T Any error in tense selection  including infinitives  S E Confusion of ser and estar  PRIM PReterit   IMperfect confusion   see T for other tenses  SP Spelling M Mood  incorrect choice of subjunctive  Indicative  or Imperative  A P Incorrect voice  i e   Active Passive  usage    1  If active change to passive  or vice versa   2  incorrect passive form  i e  se passive vs  ser passive  SYN syntax  i e  word order  Q omitted or superfluous  que  or wrong selection of  que  vs   quien   cual  etc  X Any basic grammatical error which the student should reasonably know  R Rewrite  or try another way of phrasing  you will probably have to consult me about sentences or phrases marked with brackets   which usually designate expressions that are too confusing to identify the error  or perhaps simply merit a stylistic suggestion  Others  STYLISTIC SUGGESTIONS   WC Word choice  Technically a correct selection  but better choice of wording or a better phrase should be used  ex  finalmente for por fin  also the incorporation of idiomatic phrases  ex  Estaba de mala uva  RD Redundancies  correct usage  but excessive use of the same word s  Consult the dictionary or thesaurus for other alternatives  or rephrase  Symbols may appear in the margin or above the error  When two or more errors are made in the same word  the symbols are joined with a hyphen  Ex  S   E M T   Ex  Espero que ellas ser n en la fiesta Espero que est n en la fiesta    Always find the error  correct it  rewrite it  catalogue it on your chart  and reprint your composition for regrading   Statement on disabilities  Statement on disabilities   VMI abides by Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 which mandate reasonable accommodations are provided for all cadets with documented disabilities  If you have a registered disability and may require some type of instructional and or examination accommodations  please contact me early in the semester so that I can provide or facilitate provision of accommodations you may need  If you have not already done so  you will need to register with the Office of Disabilities Services  the designated office on Post to provide services for cadets with disabilities  The office is located on the 2nd floor of the VMI Health Center  Please call or stop by the office of LTC Jones  Director of Disabilities Services  for more information  464 7667 or jonessl10 vmi edu  Guard duty and absences  Cadets  standing guard  are authorized to miss class  Those cadets who are simply  on guard  must attend class  In either case  if  an exam or other graded work is scheduled  cadets are expected to arrange a swap of guard duty  SP303W Course Calendar

current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse    Department of

result in prosecution for an honor violation    Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the

26 of Academic Regulations  Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers    Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once    Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live    1  Cadets  responsibilities  Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor    In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation    Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court    Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own    The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed

work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service

VMI WORK FOR GRADE POLICY Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of others who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of all borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s words  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing  lying  and cheating all at once Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to cadets and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all VMI cadets live 1  Cadets  responsibilities 1  Cadets  responsibilities Work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  All work submitted for grade is considered the cadet s own work   Cadet s own work  means that he or she has composed the work from his or her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the cadet s own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The cadet is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documentation Cadets are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final course grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate one s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of honor  The real issue is whether cadets received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If a cadet inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the professor and the Honor Court Each cadet bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself or herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement regarding work for grade expressed by the academic department in which he or she is taking a course  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the cadet should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own The violation by a cadet of any of these policies will  if he or she is found guilty by the Honor Court  result in his or her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade The policies of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures concerning  Work for Grade  conform to the Institute policy as stated in the Academic Regulations  It is restated here for the information of all cadets and faculty concerned Department of Modern Languages and Cultures  Departmental Statement Concerning VMI s Policies Regarding Work for Grade   Academic Regulations Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement Policy Concerning  Help Received  Statement In all written work for grade the cadet must include the words  Help Received  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the cadet must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation Help Received Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors Policy Concerning the Use of Tutors A professor may have narrower parameters than those stated above  In order to minimize problems and confusion  the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures expects every cadet enrolled in its classes to ALWAYS seek the authorization and follow the instructions given by his or her individual professor BEFORE SEEKING TUTORIAL HELP  Academic Center tutor  Athletic  NCAA  tutor  privately contracted tutor  native speaker in short  anyone who serves in a tutorial capacity  All tutorial help MUST be limited to helping the cadet by offering critical comments  Critical comments must be limited to giving general advice on such matters as organization  thesis development  support for assertions  and patterns of errors  i e  all help from a tutor must be limited to identifying errors rather than to correcting errors  Tutorial help may not include proofreading or editing Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration Policy Concerning Peer Collaboration When a fellow cadet acts in a tutorial capacity  the same guidelines apply as do those for tutors as outlined above  In group projects  help received  needs to be explained only in those instances where the group seeks outside help Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology Policy Concerning the Appropriate Use of Electronic Technology In an age of rapidly expanding technologies  the student of modern languages and cultures may need guidance from his or her professor in the appropriate use of electronic devices  Therefore  in any work for grade context  the Department of Modern Languages and cultures designates as UNAUTHORIZED the use of hand held computers  electronic translators  internet translation sites  and any service  fee or non fee  electronic or otherwise that substitutes for the cadet s own efforts in the completion of assigned work for grade  The student MUST ALWAYS CONSULT with the course instructor regarding authorized uses of such media and services Modern Language Department policy stipulates that a cadet may leave the classroom during class ONLY in cases of emergency  It is disruptive to classroom rhythm if students leave and return for water  restroom breaks  etc Spanish 303W
