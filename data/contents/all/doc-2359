Benjamin Hayes  15    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  LEXINGTON  Va  July 7  2014   For cadets struggling with the VMI Fitness Test or one of those physical fitness exams needed for a commission  help just may be on the way  A research project conducted on post this summer  a joint effort between the physical education and biology departments under the auspices of the departments  new exercise science minor  is studying the benefits of nutritional supplements in the military setting   I know people at my school always take supplements  said Spencer Buettner  15  a biology major who is working in conjunction with Capt  Daniel Jaffe  a physical education instructor  on the project   Why not do a study on something you think is the right one  If it does work  now I have something to give  Funded by the Dr  Fred C  Swope Summer Scholars Program  the project will serve as Buettner s capstone project and as the topic of Jaffe s doctoral dissertation  It will focus on the effects of the supplement beta alanine  a naturally occurring substance that can be synthesized by the human body  Beta alanine is an amino acid   amino acids are the building blocks of protein   and as such it is also regularly consumed as a proponent of protein rich foods  such as meat and eggs  Buettner and Jaffe will be concentrating on different outcomes  with the cadet exploring the possibility that the substance may help with performance on the VFT and the professor trying to determine if beta alanine can be beneficial in strength training  The idea stemmed from an article concluding that beta alanine had no benefit in a military setting  but Jaffe took issue with the methodology   They basically said it was a worthless supplement for individuals such as the cadets here  Jaffe said   The biggest problem I had with that particular article was that  with  all of their research  none of it used an environment such as this  They used sedentary individuals  non trained college students  and they made these sweeping claims  I d like to test their theory  Now that they have approval to conduct the first research project involving humans at VMI in nearly a decade  Buettner and Jaffe have begun assembling their subjects  After three days of initial testing  which includes strength testing  the VFT  and cardiovascular capacity  half of the subjects will take beta alanine over the next six weeks  The other half will be given a placebo  and at the end of the six week period  they will be tested again   They might not demonstrate marked improvements in strength  but I m guessing they will show improvement in body composition and VFT scores  said Jaffe  who not only teaches physical education classes but also teaches exercise physiology for the biology department as part of the exercise science minor  This type of research is right up Buettner s alley  The first sergeant for Company E last year  he was in charge of remedial physical training for members of his company who failed some portion of the VFT  He noted that he was barraged by questions about making improvements on the test  and while he is skeptical about beta alanine s positive effects  he is hoping that the supplement will have some benefit so he can provide some answers   If you can take the VFT and after six weeks improve  then your chances of improving on your  military  PFT is more likely  Buettner said   Almost every cadet is taking some sort of pre workout supplement  and almost all of them contain beta alanine  added Jaffe   To do an investigation that explains some of the things they are taking is good  And if that investigation can help performance on those required fitness tests  it would be even better    Chris Floyd    VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
