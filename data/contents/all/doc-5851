audience in Gillis Theater was taken by surprise when Maj  Randy Cone  VMI assistant professor of math  took the stage to deliver the third plenary talk in VMI s STEM education conference  Inquiry Based Learning  Cone opened his mouth to speak  but his voice was drowned out by a whistle  as a VMI cadet joined him on the stage and commanded the attention of all  including a group of cadets waiting in the wings  Seconds later  the audience was treated to the unusual sight of cadets dancing  with Cone himself right out in front  rapping    Cadet math majors dance at the beginning of Maj  Randy Cone s plenary talk    Photo courtesy of the VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics   Those  said Cone  as the cadets exited the stage   are math students  every one of them   That s our senior capstone course  If you infer that math at VMI can be fun  you re probably getting the drift  And  asserts Cone  it s all because of the inquiry based learning approach and the active involvement of the student in the learning process  Cone described how VMI s precalculus class has almost no lecture component   It s almost all presentations  he said  Cadets are given the floor to present their problem and its solution  no interruptions   but as soon as they get that answer box filled in  it s open mic time  Cadets contribute their own strategies for solving the problem  turning a wrong answer into a right one  sometimes several times over  as was evidenced by a video of the class   This went on for 10 minutes  said Cone   By the end of this 10 minutes  we had three different methods of solution written up on the side boards  on the front board  Cone  who said he loves teaching  derives inspiration from many sources  from Stephen Hawking  from musicians  from his dogs  Luna and Turtle  who also made an appearance on the screen during his talk      Maj  Randy Cone talks about inquiry based learning    VMI Photo by  John Robertson IV  Cone said he has a lot of experience training dogs  and when the training fails  99 percent of the time the problem is not with the dogs  it s with the owners  One natural approach to teaching is to explain   I can lecture to Luna all day long  I do and I have  said Cone   There s a problem with that  She s not a native English speaker  It doesn t work  Cone has encountered a similar situation with students   Most of my students are not native mathematics speakers  It s up to the teacher to set the lessons and praise and reward the right things  In Cone s IBL precalculus classroom  he s in the back  The students are in front  giving presentations  then  after he offers some guiding principles  they do homework  group work  experiments  And the strategy works   These students care about the material  and they re pushing through it  said Cone   Students love the independence  the responsibility for the material   Sherri Tombarge   VMI    Related Articles State Secretary of Education Opens VMI STEM Conference
