test to see how much sludge is in the primary clarifiers    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  Internship at Local Wastewater Treatment Plant Offers Learning Opportunity and Career Path LEXINGTON  Va  July 27  2015   Allison Partin  17 might count herself lucky that college professors generally don t ask their students to write about what they did over the summer break  It s not that Partin would mind such an assignment  She loves to talk about what she s done  But if she did get asked to write the traditional  summer vacation  essay  the reader would wind up discovering what people flush down their toilets  intentionally or by accident  A civil engineering major  Partin is interning this summer at the Buena Vista Wastewater Treatment Plant  While much of her job has to do with assessing water quality  she is also assigned to rake out the bar screen  which filters water coming into the plant from municipal sewer lines  The most unusual item she s found so far has been a yo yo   and she can t figure out how an item that large managed to make its way through the plumbing  Other items are much smaller  and perhaps more to be expected   Pennies and dimes show up a lot  she noted  Other frequently flushed items include paper towels and jewelry   I guess when people run out of toilet paper  they use paper towels  Partin observed  As for the jewelry  it s anyone s guess as to whether or not its method of disposal was purposeful  Partin thinks not  at least in most cases   But I m not going to go searching for the owner  she commented   Once it s gone  it s gone  Partin came to VMI as a biology major  but discovered during her 4th Class year that her true calling was in engineering  It didn t hurt that her brother  Johnny Partin  14  was also a civil engineering major  In the summer of 2014  Allison Partin traveled to Bolivia with the Keydets Without Borders group led by Lt  Col  Tim Moore II  97  associate professor of civil and environmental engineering  There  as she helped build latrine shower combinations for villagers who had never before had indoor plumbing  Partin felt herself drawn to the environmental side of engineering  As the summer of 2015 approached  Partin went to Capt  John  Ned  Riester  78  head of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering  and asked about internship possibilities  As head of the Maury Service Authority  the regional entity in charge of the municipal water supply for the city of Lexington and parts of Rockbridge County  Riester has good connections  and it wasn t long before Partin had secured her position in Buena Vista  When June 1 arrived  and Partin showed up for her first day of work  she wasn t sure if she d made the right decision  She recalled her first thought   It smells awful  I can t believe I m working here  Soon  though  Partin found herself adjusting to the smell  which she said is confined to certain parts of the plant  She also found herself enjoying both the work and her co workers  Of the latter  she noted   The people I work with are great  They re hilarious  We joke about it  saying   At least we all smell the same  Arriving at 6 30 a m  each scheduled work day  Partin immediately goes to work testing water samples to ensure that pH levels are within the normal range  both for water coming in and water going out   If it s not in a specific range  we really do have a problem that has to be addressed right now  she noted  Later tasks include serving as the  sludge judge  who inspects solid wastes as they re in the process of dehydrating  so the plant operator will know when it s time to have the wastes hauled away in a dump truck  Partin and Trina Mastran  the city s director of water quality  have also been testing phosphorous and nitrogen levels in the water  as the state Department of Environmental Quality sets limits on how much of these elements can be released into the Chesapeake Bay watershed  Riester noted that for a budding engineer  this kind of experience is invaluable   Most of the internships are pretty good  but every now and then you hear about one where they say   Oh  I just made coffee  he commented   I knew from talking to Trina that she d be a great mentor and help  Partin  get her hands dirty    It s just a great opportunity  Partin agreed  noting that she s now considering a multitude of possibilities for after graduation  among them working at a wastewater treatment plant near her hometown of Chester  or possibly going to graduate school for environmental engineering or petroleum engineering  No matter which way she goes  Partin is grateful that her path has included a stint in the wastewater treatment plant   I just don t think people see the opportunities  wastewater treatment  has  she said   People always judge it and say   I don t want to deal with human waste  but   you re basically making the water safe for an entire city   Mary Price  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features
