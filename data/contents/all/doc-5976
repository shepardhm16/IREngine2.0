 2013  I became the new department head  I was fortunate to be appointed to the position in fall of 2012  thus being able to work with Floyd and learn a great deal about the job  Second  replacing Floyd on the faculty is Bing Jiang  who recently received her Ph D  in economics from Emory University  In this newsletter you will find a link to her bio  We are excited to have her join the department  Third  in addition to being department head  Floyd Duncan was the holder of the Robert s Chair in Free Enterprise Economics  That chair is now held by Col  Atin Basu  who is well deserving of this honor  We hope you will enjoy reading about the many exciting activities and accomplishments of the past academic year  Just click on the topic heading for the full story  Best Regards  Col
