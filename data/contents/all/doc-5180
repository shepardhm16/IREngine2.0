Rebecca McDowell Letter  1864 July Ghost Cadet Resources Rebecca McDowell letter  July 1864  Ghost Cadet top level  This letter is courtesy Dr  and Mrs  Murphy Cronland  owners of the original document  and reproduced with their permission  July 25th  1864 My Dear Aunt  I have been intending to write to you but have felt so badly that I put it off from day to day  hoping that my heavy sorrow would grow lighter  But it does seem to me that it only deepens as I reflect on it and realize my loss as days pass away  At first  I could think of every blessing that had been vouchsafed me in connection with it  But now  altho  I do not murmur or complain and can from the heart say  Thy will be done  yet I recall the mercies remaining  but can t feel the same gratitude  I felt so thankful that the poor  dear child was not wounded   taken prisoner by our cruel foes that he did not linger in agony and that as he had to die  that he died in the discharge of his duty to his God   his country  and not a craven coward   illegible  away his life  I realized that there are some things  harder to bear than death  the disgrace of those we love  I felt so thankful that I had full assurance of happiness   that he passed from earth to Heaven with but one sigh  But now I only feel my loss  I can t think of him in Heaven with that bright angelic host mingling his praises with the Redeemed  I only feel that his loss to me is  irreparable  That I shall no more see his form   so erect  no more gaze at his beautiful eyes lit up with mirth or enthusiasm   no more see those dimples in his cheeks as he would break out into his merry peal of laughter or look at the long dark lashes when he was in thought  This was the month in which he was to have been at home  and when I had expected to send him into the army with my prayers   blessings  I had made up my mind to give him to his God   country  but O not so soon  Could I weep  it would bring relief  but I cannot  Before these Union people  some of whom I have heard of exulting him his death  I talk of my noble hero boy  I am calm   cheerful  I tell how thankful I am that he fell at the post of honor   duty   c  But my heart   O how it aches  afterwards   but if I died  they should not know if was with grief  My child died in defence of the South  To that cause my life is devoted and my God in his mercy take all that are dear to me   myself before we ever bend to yankee rule  We had a kind   sympathizing letter from a gentleman in Lex ington  whose son was a room mate of Willie s on last Saturday  He says that his son Edward Tutwiler   Willie were  fast friends    that his son was much attached to him   that a short time before the Yankees took possession of Lexington he visited the room the boys occupied for the purpose of getting away the clothes   other things left by his son   on examination he found several articles belonging to our son  among them his daguerreotype He says that he looked for his trunk but it could not be found   Col Preston writes that it is believed to have been burnt in the Inst or carried off by free negroes before  His watch  his father s gold one  bought while he was in college  cannot be heard of  neither his Bible  Col Preston s son  who was Capt of the Company  said that he assisted in burying him  that there was no mutilation  no bruise on the body except where the fatal ball entered but neither his watch nor Bible were on his person  Mr  Tutwiler says that his his son in writing to him from New Market said  my roommate McDowell was killed  in the front rank  I know he has gone to heaven for he was a sincere Christian    the Father adds in his letter  This should cheer you  in your sad affliction  for you loss has been His gain  Revd Dr  White of Lexington  whom I ve met with at the Gen l  illegible  has sent us part of his hair  retaining the other half for fear it might be lost  and writes that he hears Willie spoken of by every body who knew him in the most flattering terms by Profs    c  Dr  White   Col  Preston have both lost most promising sons in battle    seem to sympathise much with us  We have been treated with much kindness by all our friends   had very many kind letters  Willie had not been social until grace sanctified his heart  But on his last visit home his health was better   he was so bright   merry and his associates always spoke of him as being so intelligent    well read  so truthful   reliable  despising everything low   mean  He had the qualities that would have ensured success integrity  perseverance   energy with great  several words illegible   We had such a kind letter from dear James about Willie  May God spare him to you  dear Aunt   bless you all  With much love to Lizzie
