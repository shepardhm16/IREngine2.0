Murphy Cronland  owners of the original document  and reproduced with their permission  July 25th  1864 My Dear Aunt  I have been intending to write to you but have felt so badly that I put it off from day to day  hoping that my heavy sorrow would grow lighter  But it does seem to me that it only deepens as I reflect on it and realize my loss as days pass away  At first  I could think of every blessing that had been vouchsafed me in connection with it  But now  altho  I do not murmur or complain and can from the heart say  Thy will be done  yet I recall the mercies remaining  but can t feel the same gratitude  I felt so thankful that the poor  dear child was not wounded   taken prisoner by our cruel foes that he did not linger in agony and that as he had to die  that he died in the discharge of his duty to his God   his country  and not a craven coward   illegible  away his life  I realized that there are some things  harder to bear than death  the disgrace of those we love  I felt so thankful that I had full assurance of happiness   that he passed from earth to Heaven with but one sigh  But now I only feel my loss  I can t think of him in Heaven with that bright angelic host mingling his praises with the Redeemed  I only feel that his loss to me is  irreparable  That I shall no more see his form   so erect  no more gaze at his beautiful eyes lit up with mirth or enthusiasm   no more see those dimples in his cheeks as he would break out into his merry peal of laughter or look at the long dark lashes when he was in thought  This was the month in which he was to have been at home  and when I had expected to send him into the army with my prayers   blessings  I had made up my mind to give him to his God   country  but O not so soon  Could I weep  it would bring relief  but I cannot  Before these Union people  some of whom I have heard of exulting him his death  I talk of my noble hero boy  I am calm   cheerful  I tell how thankful I am that he fell at the post of honor   duty   c  But my heart   O how it aches  afterwards   but if I died  they should not know if was with grief  My child died in defence of the South  To that cause my life is devoted and my God in his mercy take all that are dear to me   myself before we ever bend to yankee rule  We had a kind   sympathizing letter from a gentleman in Lex ington  whose son was a room mate of

heavy sorrow would grow lighter  But it does seem to me that it only deepens as I reflect on it and realize my loss as days pass away  At first  I could think of every blessing that had been vouchsafed me in connection with it  But now  altho  I do not murmur or complain and can from the heart say  Thy will be done  yet I recall the mercies remaining  but can t feel the same gratitude  I felt so thankful that the poor  dear child was not wounded   taken prisoner by our cruel foes that he did not linger in agony and that as he had to die  that he died in the discharge of his duty to his God   his country  and not a craven coward   illegible  away his life  I realized that there are some things  harder to bear than death  the disgrace of those we love  I felt so thankful that I had full assurance of happiness   that he passed from earth to Heaven with but one sigh  But now I only feel my loss  I can t think of him in Heaven with that bright angelic host mingling his praises with the Redeemed  I only feel that his loss to me is  irreparable  That I shall no more see his form   so erect  no more gaze at his beautiful eyes lit up with mirth or enthusiasm   no more see those dimples in his cheeks as he would break out into his merry peal of laughter or look at the long dark lashes when he was in thought  This was the month in which he was to have been at home  and when I had expected to send him into the army with my prayers   blessings  I had made up my mind to give him to his God   country  but O not so soon  Could I weep  it would bring relief  but I cannot  Before these Union people  some of whom I have heard of exulting him his death  I talk of my noble hero boy  I am calm   cheerful  I tell how thankful I am that he fell at the post of honor   duty   c  But
