winningest VMI football coach  New Book Describes Esteemed Coach John McKenna and His Era LEXINGTON  Va  Dec  5  2014  John McKenna has long been considered a legend on post at VMI  Now he is being immortalized  Roland Lazenby  74 recently co wrote a book with veteran sports writer Mike Ashley about the winningest coach in VMI football history  Best Regrets chronicles McKenna s life and his 13 years on the VMI sideline  when he led the Keydets to six straight winning seasons  including an undefeated campaign in 1957  and four Southern Conference championships  It is also a look at the uniqueness of the man himself and a lost era of college football   It s sort of a lost history of VMI s great coach  Lazenby said   He was a very tough  beloved figure  This book looks at that aspect of  the man  and at that time  In addition to Lazenby  who played one year of football as a cadet  a number of other VMI figures had a hand in producing the biography  The Keydet Club paid the publishing costs  and Bobby Ross  59  who played for McKenna and went on to win a national championship at Georgia Tech  wrote the foreword  Col  Mike Strickler  71  who worked at his alma mater for 38 years  including 15 as the sports information director  did much of the editing work and came up with many of the photos that encompass 38 pages of the book  Burton  B R  Floyd III  publications manager in the Office of Communications and Marketing  was in charge of copy editing and design   The book s title derives from that 1957 season  when VMI posted a 9 0 1 record  climbed into the top 25 of the national football polls  and earned an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl  McKenna allowed his players to vote on whether or not to participate in that game  and the players decided not to play  According to the book  that is a decision that followed McKenna for a long  long time   There was some debate over whether Coach McKenna regretted letting them vote  explained Lazenby   It seemed to me to sum up the essence of Coach McKenna  Football was a different game more than 50 years ago  however  and Best Regrets takes the reader back to that era when one platoon football was rule  Only 11 players took the field for teams back then  on both sides of the football  which allowed small schools like VMI to compete with their big time counterparts   It was really a unique era in college football  Strickler said   One platoon football was mandated by the NCAA  and that really helped VMI  It was also an era when student athletes truly were just that  During McKenna s tenure  VMI football boasted at least two Rhodes Scholars  and Strickler noted that once VMI s entire graduating backfield went on to become doctors or lawyers  Under McKenna  Strickler said  95 to 96 percent of his football players earned degrees  a phenomenal rate compared to today s college football standards  While Best Regrets is a nostalgic look at the college game  which has changed dramatically over the last 50 years  most of all it is about McKenna  who was the center of attention again when more than 100 of his former players gathered on post over the Halloween weekend for a McKenna reunion  Lazenby was there for a book signing that kicked off a celebration of the man and the book that immortalizes him   He was sort of a mystery  Lazenby said   He wasn t the typical coach  He was a man of letters  and he was a man of tremendous principle  His wife said he had this innate ability to make people want to play for him  and those guys really wanted to do well for him  That  in itself  is a mystery  one even the players cannot explain  McKenna was smart  and he was a motivator  At the same time  however  he was  as Ross explains in the foreword  a man who ruled with an  iron fist   He wasn t a ranter and raver at all  said Strickler   But  what he said went  and nobody questioned it   The players  feared the man  but they all respected him   He was preparing these guys for later in life  and what these guys knew later on was the discipline he taught them    The way that he did it prepared them for hardships  Strickler added   That s why they have so much respect for this man  And that is why they have remained so loyal  Two of his former players  Tom Daniel  60 and Howard Moss  60  first approached VMI s superintendent  Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  about a book about McKenna several years ago  and Best Regrets is the result  a book that Lazenby says is  a good look at what a football coach ought to be   All of the players who played for him  all of the people who were inspired by him wanted to have his story told  the author said   He was a great  great coach  He was the perfect coach for VMI  To order Best Regrets  visit www vmialumni org

Coach John McKenna and His Era LEXINGTON  Va  Dec  5  2014  John McKenna has long been considered a legend on post at VMI  Now he is being immortalized  Roland Lazenby  74 recently co wrote a book with veteran sports writer Mike Ashley about the winningest coach in VMI football history  Best Regrets chronicles McKenna s life and his 13 years on the VMI sideline  when he led the Keydets to six straight winning seasons  including an undefeated campaign in 1957  and four Southern Conference championships  It is also a look at the uniqueness of the man himself and a lost era of college football   It s sort of a lost history of VMI s great coach  Lazenby said   He was a very tough  beloved figure  This book looks at that aspect of  the man  and at that time  In addition to Lazenby  who played one year of football as a cadet  a number of other VMI figures had a hand in producing the biography  The Keydet Club paid the publishing costs  and Bobby Ross  59  who played for McKenna and went on to win a national championship at Georgia Tech  wrote the foreword  Col  Mike Strickler  71  who worked at his alma mater for 38 years  including 15 as the sports information director  did much of the editing work and came up with many of the photos that encompass 38 pages of the book  Burton  B R  Floyd III  publications manager in the Office of Communications and Marketing  was in charge of copy editing and design   The book s title derives from that 1957 season  when VMI posted a 9 0 1 record  climbed into the top 25 of the national football polls  and earned an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl  McKenna allowed his players to vote on whether or not to participate in that game  and the players decided not to play  According to the book  that is a decision that followed McKenna for a long  long time   There was some debate over whether Coach McKenna regretted letting them vote  explained Lazenby   It seemed to me to sum up the essence of Coach McKenna  Football was a different game more than 50 years ago  however  and Best Regrets takes the reader back to that era when one platoon football was rule  Only 11 players took the field for teams back then  on both sides of the football  which allowed small schools like VMI to compete with their big time counterparts   It was really a unique era in college football  Strickler said   One platoon football was mandated by the NCAA  and that really helped VMI  It was also an era when student athletes truly were just that  During McKenna s tenure  VMI football boasted at least two Rhodes Scholars  and Strickler noted that once VMI s entire graduating backfield went on to become doctors or lawyers  Under McKenna  Strickler said  95 to 96 percent of his football players earned degrees  a phenomenal rate compared to today s college football standards  While Best Regrets is a nostalgic look at the college game  which has changed dramatically over the last 50 years  most of all it is about McKenna  who was the center of attention again when more than 100 of his former players gathered on post over the Halloween weekend for a McKenna reunion  Lazenby was there for a book signing that kicked off a celebration of the man and the book that immortalizes him   He was sort of a mystery  Lazenby said   He wasn t the typical coach  He was a man of letters  and he was a man of tremendous principle  His wife said he had this innate ability to make people want to play for him  and those guys really wanted to do well for him  That  in itself  is a mystery  one even the players cannot explain  McKenna was smart  and he was a motivator  At the same time  however  he was  as Ross explains in the foreword  a man who ruled with an  iron fist   He wasn t a ranter and raver at all  said Strickler   But  what he said went  and nobody questioned it   The players  feared the man  but they all respected him   He was preparing these guys for later in life  and what these guys knew later on was the discipline he taught them    The way that he did it prepared them for hardships  Strickler added   That s why they have so much respect for this man  And that is why they have remained so loyal  Two of his former players  Tom Daniel  60 and Howard Moss  60  first approached VMI s superintendent  Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  about a book about McKenna several years ago  and Best Regrets is the result  a book that Lazenby says is  a good look at what a football coach ought to be   All of the players who played for him  all of the people who were inspired by him wanted to have his story told  the author
