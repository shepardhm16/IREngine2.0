sheet of paper is the abstract  You may wish to use color for highlighting and to make your poster more attractive  Keep in mind the posterboard is a royal blue  Use pictures  diagrams  cartoons  figures  etc  rather than text wherever possible  Try to state your main result in large lettering  This way people can read the poster from a distance  People will not read a lot of text  and certainly won t read typewriter sized text  The smallest text on your poster should be at least 18 point  and the important points should be in a larger size  Make your poster as self explanatory as
