Academics   Areas of Study   Science   Math   Physics   Astronomy   Cadet Researches Polarization Using Thin Films Cadet Researches Polarization Using Thin Films VMI 1st classman Nick Potter is conducting graduate level work in physics   while still an undergraduate  In the thin films lab in the basement of Mallory Hall  Potter is creating Janus particles   so named because they have one side different from the other   out of polystyrene spheres  Polystyrene is a type of plastic  The size of these Janus particles  20 microns  is so small as to be almost unimaginable  as a micron is one millionth of a meter  To make the spheres into Janus particles  Potter coats one half of them with a metallic layer that is currently made out of aluminum  although he hopes to use gold eventually  With the Janus spheres created  Potter puts them on a microscope slide and uses an electrical field to control their orientation in space   If all of the spheres are oriented in the correct direction    that will cause polarization of the light that s being reflected off of it  Potter explained   Basically  what we are trying to do is coat optics in these Janus particles so we can easily control their orientation and ultimately their polarization by just using an electric field  Potter said that these particles could be used for the front optics of telescopes  to make the analysis of polarized starlight much easier  Another cadet  fellow physics major Philip Wulfken  13   who just happens to be Potter s roommate   is currently conducting research on the analysis of polarized starlight  Potter s faculty adviser  Lt  Col  Daniela Topasna  added that using ultra small dimensions for the Janus particles delivers a key advantage when dealing with optical applications   By using these particles  you can reduce the size and create novel gratings so then the wavelength that can be used goes down into the visible  ultraviolet  spectrum  she noted  Topasna continued   Our goal is to create grating with the metals by orienting them with an electric field  More of a broad goal is to combine that type of grating with a filter  Combining a filter and polarizer into one unit can save space on devices such as cameras and telescopes  she explained  Potter  meanwhile  came to VMI with a strong interest in physics  He d discovered the subject while in an accelerated science and math program at Mills Godwin High School in his native Henrico County  By the time he was a senior in high school  he knew he d be majoring in physics in college   so when he came to VMI as a prospective cadet  he took a tour of the physics lab and liked what he saw  During the summer of 2011  Potter worked with Col  John Thompson  professor of physics  on a project having to do with optics  He began his current work on thin films with Topasna and her husband  Lt  Col  Gregory Topasna  last summer   We are always looking  for cadets to do research  because it s such a small pool of students  said Lt  Col  Daniela Topasna  Potter is one of only three physics majors graduating this year  Topasna was quick to add that the kind of research Potter is doing would not be possible had it not been for a state funded renovation of Mallory Hall in 2006 07  During that renovation  the study carrels which once filled the basement of Mallory were replaced by the thin films lab  Some of the equipment for the thin films lab was purchased with money from the Jackson Hope Fund   This is unique  Topasna commented   The equipment we have here is typical for a graduate school   The renovation really helped us a lot  By   Mary Price IR   Dec  2012 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents

Polarization Using Thin Films VMI 1st classman Nick Potter is conducting graduate level work in physics   while still an undergraduate  In the thin films lab in the basement of Mallory Hall  Potter is creating Janus particles   so named because they have one side different from the other   out of polystyrene spheres  Polystyrene is a type of plastic  The size of these Janus particles  20 microns  is so small as to be almost unimaginable  as a micron is one millionth of a meter  To make the spheres into Janus particles  Potter coats one half of them with a metallic layer that is currently made out of aluminum  although he hopes to use gold eventually  With the Janus spheres created  Potter puts them on a microscope slide and uses an electrical field to control their orientation in space   If all of the spheres are oriented in the correct direction    that will cause polarization of the light that s being reflected off of it  Potter explained   Basically  what we are trying to do is coat optics in these Janus particles so we can easily control their orientation and ultimately their polarization by just using an electric field  Potter said that these particles could be used for the front optics of telescopes  to make the analysis of polarized starlight much easier  Another cadet  fellow physics major Philip Wulfken  13   who just happens to be Potter s roommate   is currently conducting research on the analysis of polarized starlight  Potter s faculty adviser  Lt  Col  Daniela Topasna  added that using ultra small dimensions for the Janus particles delivers a key advantage when dealing with optical applications   By using these particles  you can reduce the size and create novel gratings so then the wavelength that can be used goes down into the visible  ultraviolet  spectrum  she noted  Topasna continued   Our goal is to create grating with the metals by orienting them with an electric field  More of a broad goal is to combine that type of grating with a filter  Combining a filter and polarizer into one unit can save space on devices such as cameras and telescopes  she explained  Potter  meanwhile  came to VMI with a strong interest in physics  He d discovered the subject while in an accelerated science and math program at Mills Godwin High School in his native Henrico County  By the time he was a senior in high school  he knew he d be majoring in physics in college   so when he came to VMI as a prospective cadet  he took a tour of the physics lab and liked what he saw  During the summer of 2011  Potter worked with Col  John Thompson  professor of physics  on a project having to do with optics  He began his current work on thin films with Topasna and her husband  Lt  Col  Gregory Topasna  last summer   We are always looking  for cadets to do research  because it s such a small pool of students  said Lt  Col  Daniela Topasna  Potter is one of only three physics majors graduating this year  Topasna was quick to add that the kind of research Potter is doing would not be possible had it not been for a state funded renovation of Mallory Hall in 2006 07  During that renovation  the study carrels which once filled the basement of Mallory were replaced by the thin films lab  Some of the equipment for the thin films lab was purchased with money from the Jackson Hope Fund   This is unique  Topasna commented   The equipment we have here is typical for a graduate school   The renovation really helped us a lot  By   Mary Price IR   Dec  2012 Natural Sciences Physics and Astronomy Home Degrees   Programs Courses
