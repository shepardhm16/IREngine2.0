scholarship informs good teaching  That s how Col  Jim Hentz  chair of VMI s international studies department  describes the synergy between his twin commitments   one to teaching cadets and the other to professional consulting on politics and security in sub Saharan Africa  Over the past decade  Hentz has lectured aboard aircraft carriers  made countless trips overseas  and been interviewed three times by the British Broadcasting Corp  On a daily basis  he reads manuscripts intended for publication in the quarterly journal African Security  which he founded and now edits  Over time  Hentz has accumulated so many name tags and credentials from conferences that they spill over a hook on his office wall  In recognition of his achievements as a scholar  Hentz has been named as the recipient of the 2014 Scholar Award for Scholarship in International Studies and Political Science by the Virginia Social Science Association  He will receive the award at that organization s annual meeting April 19 in Richmond  Nominating Hentz was Lt  Col  Keith Kline  associate professor of psychology  who is a member of the VSSA s board   I nominated  Hentz  because he is an extremely accomplished and internationally renowned scholar and an expert in his field  said Kline   In my view  what makes his level of scholarly productivity particularly remarkable is that he has achieved this at a small  military college with its own set of unique demands  His scholarship is also especially impressive in light of the fact that he is a department head who has played a primary role in the development of what has become a truly exemplary department that offers the most popular academic major at VMI  Displaying an energy level that many would envy  Hentz recently took on a new commitment as a consultant for Wikistrat  a privately owned online consulting firm  In the fall of 2013  Hentz participated in a simulation for the U S  Army Africa Command  or AFRICOM  which addressed illicit trafficking in the Trans Sahel region of Africa  a transition zone between the Sahara Desert to the north and the grasslands to the south  At the end of the simulation  Hentz won one of four awards for best analyst  In addition  Hentz has recently completed work on his next book  The Nature of War in Africa  which is now under contract to be published   I have some responsibility to educate people about what s going on in Africa  he commented   That s part of my job  As an example  Hentz noted that very few people are aware that by the start of the 21st century  more people were being killed in wars in Africa than in the rest of the world combined  With a lifelong ambition to do research and teach  Hentz has found academia to be an easy fit  Likewise  he s found international studies to be an ideal discipline   I want to talk and think about  things that have a real world impact  he said  For Hentz  that emphasis on the real world has been a constant theme  Immediately after graduating from St  Joseph s College in Philadelphia  now St  Joseph s University  Hentz traveled to American Samoa  where he taught for two years  He then came back to the United States to work as a legislative aide on Capitol Hill and earn a master s degree from Georgetown University  Before going on for a doctorate  Hentz packed his bags for another teaching stint in Zambia  a landlocked African country that was once a British colony  He later returned to Africa to do dissertation research in South Africa just as the late Nelson Mandela was elected president  Now lining Hentz s office walls are posters from Mandela s campaign  which Hentz took down from telephone poles the day after the election   I wanted to go do a Ph D   with an emphasis on Africa  but before that  I wanted to go live in the place I was going to study  said Hentz   I didn t want to read a book by somebody who d read a book by somebody who went to Africa  I wanted to be the guy who went to Africa  Hentz now uses that powerful combination of life experience and book knowledge to prepare cadets for lives that may take them across the globe  Each academic year  Hentz teaches at least four sections of a required international studies class  U S  National Security Policy  and he occasionally teaches another course  War and Peace in Africa   This  consulting  work informs my teaching of national security  said Hentz   I use it all the time  Hentz s commitment to scholarship fueled teaching has been recognized twice   first in 2004  when he was the recipient of the VMI Distinguished Teaching Award  and again in 2007  when he won the state Outstanding Faculty Award  given by the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia  Hentz admits that the everyday juggling act of teaching  scholarship  and personal commitments isn t easy  but his passion to share knowledge drives him onward   It s not hard when you like it  By  Mary Price IR   April 2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club
