Creek at Jordan s Point     Wooden Footbridge Over Warm Run Remnants of Reid s Lock and Dam     Limestone Formations    Remnants of Zimmerman s Lock    Jordan s Point Park and Route 11 Bridge  The Industrial Section  Jordan s Point is the site of the confluence between Woods Creek and the Maury River  Just upstream of Jordan s Point is an old millrace  c  1810  built by John Jordan  In the mid 1800s  Jordan s Point was home to a saw mill  foundry  forge  warehouses  and storefronts  Once the North River canal was built  Jordan s Point also served as the canal basin  Concrete pilings are still visible where the old railroad tracks crossed the river  The bridge washed out in Hurricane Camille  A pedestrian bridge was rebuilt as part of the Chessie Nature Trail was built on the pilings but was destroyed as well in a 1995 flood  Route 11 Bridge to Mill Creek  This stretch of the trail is dominated by alien invasive plant species due to frequent human impact over time  Along this stretch is the first of the  BF  markers from the Lexington end of the trail  These concrete posts alerted the trains to the distance in miles to Balcony Falls  where the Lexington branch of the railroad met the Chesapeake   Ohio s main line  Rock outcrops to the sides of the trail are from Ordovician age Edinburg Formation   limestone formed in relatively deep water  folded during the Alleghenian Orogeny  Also on this stretch of the trail  but across Old Buena Vista Road  trail users can see Clifton   a house built in the early 19th century by Maj  John Alexander  Remains of the old railroad track can be seen in front of this house  marking the location where trains used to turn around and back into the city  Mill Creek to Reid s Dam  Note    This portion of the trail is a wonderful wildflower walk in spring  but do not pick or dig up the flowers  In some cases  this can be a criminal offense  Two wooden footbridges next to the Mill Creek entrance  towards the Jordan s Point end of the trail  cross over Mill Creek  stone wall remains below the trail are left from the old mill race at that location  The Edinburg Formation continues along this stretch  on the left if facing downstream  Trail users can see the sediment layers  tilted due to mountain building and folding  The trail passes an old quarry site complete with drill holes   a clear sign of the blasting used by the railroad and canals for channel modification  canal towpath and rail bed construction  and local quarry of stones for both infrastructures  Farther downstream  trail users can see the top of Reid s Lock from a small observation area off the trail  a path to the area is typically cleared  Stonewall Jackson s body was brought to Lexington for burial in 1863 via Reid s Lock and Dam  After the canal era  the dam was used for hydroelectric power until the 1930s  Slightly farther downstream is a broad limestone outcrop right above the water   a perfect spot for resting or picnicking  Reid s Dam to South River  At the beginning of this stretch is a bamboo grove  although providing an exciting surprise  the plants are alien invasives and were likely planted early in the trail s history  The trail passes over Warm Run just before passing under the I 81 bridge  The meadow near this bridge provides a robust habitat for wildlife and sits on top of one of the most important thrust faults in the Appalachians  This stretch holds a  BF 16  marker   again a reference to Balcony Falls  Rocks between this marker and Zimmerman s Lock are part of the Cambrian age Conococheague Formation limestone  which has been thrust onto the Edinburg Formation  This portion of the trail also passes through private pastureland  please exercise caution and respect while moving through gates  After passing through the first gate  a building foundation from the 1800s can be seen   probably the remains of a lock keeper s house for the South River Lock  The remains of the South River Lock and Dam can also be seen in the river  South River to Ben Salem Lock  Unfortunately  the bridge over South River was washed out during Hurricane Isabel in 2003  To continue on the trail after reaching the parking area  users must cross South River on the vehicle bridge  Virginia Route 703 608  Continue along Route 608 for less than half a mile before turning left on Route 839  Old Sheppard Road  which leads downhill to a gate with a stile  Climb the stile to access the trail   a dirt road at this point  Parking is also available on a shoulder close to the junction of routes 608 and 839  This section boasts some interesting geologic features  again featuring the Conococheague Formation   formed in an ancient  shallow sea  This limestone also yields a few small solution cavities and one large cave seen above the trail  A  BF 14  marker can be found on this stretch  Ben Salem Lock to Zimmerman s Lock  Again  this portion of the trail contains many interesting geologic folds and outcrops  A  BF 13  marker is located on the wide river floodplain  and just downstream of the marker is Zimmerman s Lock and Dam  Although only a small portion of the dam remains  the lock is in quite good shape  Zimmerman s Dam   like Reid s Dam   was used for hydroelectric power for many years after the canal era ended  In fact  it was the provider of electricity for Buena Vista in the late 1800s  A number of exposed caves appear in the rock wall towards this end of the trail  Because most caves are initially formed below the water table  these provide evidence of the Maury s downward cutting through  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination Statement

Zimmerman s Lock and Dam  Although only a small portion of the dam remains  the lock is in quite good shape  Zimmerman s Dam   like Reid s Dam   was used for hydroelectric power for many years after the canal era ended  In fact  it was the provider of electricity for Buena Vista in the late 1800s  A number of exposed caves appear in the rock wall towards this end of the trail  Because most caves
