against crime  The workshop focused on how criminal behavior and policing methods will change in the near future because of influences from emerging technologies  including developments in nanotechnology  robotics  avionics  manufacturing  and biotechnology   This is new territory on how criminals threaten society  said Cotting   We had scientists  agents  analysts  and others who all had some great expertise in one domain or another  whether it was biotechnology  energy  or 3 D printing  Around 50 experts attended the workshop   The goal is to support the policing done by the FBI in its various missions  said Cotting  He is contributing to the development of a group analysis protocol  a system for understanding the methods for recruiting reliable informants from within criminal groups  During the workshop  Cotting presented a talk on this protocol and how it fits into the context of these emerging technologies   This is an analytic tool to aid an agent or analyst in spotting  assessing  developing  and recruiting confidential human sources  said Cotting   It s not only about who is most likely to turn  but when is the best time for someone to approach him or her  Cotting  along with many of the other participants  will contribute to a book that will combine expertise from the presentations with insight gleaned from the workshop s multidisciplinary collaboration   We took part in focus groups after each presentation  so we had computer scientists talking to engineers talking to physicists  said Cotting   For the book  the presenters will write about what they presented and add any of the conversations that might have shaped their views  By  John Robertson IV IR   Oct  2014 Home   Academics   Areas of Study   Social Science   Psychology
