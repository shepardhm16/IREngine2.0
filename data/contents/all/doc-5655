24450 Psychology Professor Begins Role as URI Director Institute Report  December 2010 Lt  Col  Keith Kline came to VMI five years ago seeking a student focused teaching environment   a place where students come first  He found what he was looking for at the Institute and now has the opportunity to take it a step further as director of undergraduate research   I ve inherited a very successful  nationally recognized program  said Kline  an associate professor of psychology   I d like to build on this strong foundation and help create a culture of undergraduate research at VMI   Creating a culture of undergraduate research  is a catch phrase Kline has heard over the past year or two  and it s one that fits his goals for the Undergraduate Research Initiative   At certain times it feels like a culture here at VMI  but it doesn t feel like a culture in enough ways and enough in frequency  he said   We ve got to make undergraduate research more pervasive  and one way to start is to integrate undergraduate research into our methods of teaching and learning  If we continue to rethink the way we teach and encourage our students to learn using active  inquiry based methods  we will take a step toward embedding undergraduate research into our culture  To that end  Kline is focusing his initial efforts to create this culture on the faculty  On Dec  3  he led a workshop on integrating undergraduate research into the curriculum  He based the workshop on ideas he s gathered at conferences and from other schools with strong undergraduate research programs  Faculty also can apply for grants through a new developmental grant program  Integrating Undergraduate Research into the Curriculum  which offers funding to redesign a current course they re teaching or to create a new class that incorporates creative ways to foster undergraduate research  Professors can apply independently or work together to create a course or small cluster of thematically related courses  and grant proposals are due on Jan  31  2011  Amended courses could begin as early as this summer or next fall  while new courses would have to go through a longer approval process   I d like to see us get past viewing undergraduate research as an optional activity and get to a point where it s seen as essential to a cadet s education  said Kline   I don t see every cadet equally embracing this type of work  but I think every student should be exposed to it at some level  We face a number of challenges that make culture change difficult  but these challenges don t make it impossible  we just have to be flexible and work around them  A psychology professor whose specialties include biopsychology and psychophysiology  Kline is no stranger to research  At VMI  he has received the Dr  D  Rae Carpenter Award for the best research proposal submitted to the VMI Research Committee for a research grant  and he has collaborated with cadets on award winning presentations at the Undergraduate Research Symposium and on Summer Undergraduate Research Institute projects  Kline also received the Thomas Jefferson Teaching Award in 2008  Kline could have remained at a larger institution where research is the priority  but he believes his place is in an environment that fosters teaching and one where undergraduate research is an important part of the learning process   There are benefits of undergraduate research for both faculty and students  but especially for students  said Kline   When cadets take part in research  there s a transformational type of learning that takes place  They learn about themselves and gain confidence and life skills that are attractive in the workplace  Kline added that undergraduate research experience provides leadership development to those who will commission  He considers it essential for those students interested in pursuing graduate degrees upon graduating from VMI  Kline added that faculty who engage with their students in one on one research projects experience the reward of mentoring them in a project to its completion and often are able to facilitate their own research projects  Most importantly  faculty members have the opportunity to make an impact on their students  lives   One of my most rewarding moments as a teacher came with a phone call from one of my students  mothers  said Kline   Through a research project we worked on together  he discovered he was intelligent  It wasn t what I taught him as much as that I drew it out of him and helped him overcome his own perceived limitations  Sometimes all it takes is a little bit of success  Kline said he is excited about the challenge of leading the URI and cultivating a culture of undergraduate research at VMI   VMI has been a tremendous fit for me  and undergraduate research is something I m really passionate about  he said   Leading the URI is a new and unique challenge  and I think my background has prepared me for it well    VMI Foundation Keydet
