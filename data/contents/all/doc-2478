Numbers Up for Naval ROTC Commissioning Numbers Up for Naval ROTC Commissioning At the conclusion of the 2013 14 academic year  the Naval ROTC unit at VMI will have hit a milestone  commissioning the highest number of Navy ensigns and Marine Corps second lieutenants in a single year since 2003  A total of 55 VMI graduates have already commissioned this academic year in either the Navy or Marine Corps  or will do so over the summer  Of that number  32 entered the Navy  while 23 entered the Marine Corps  Not included in those numbers are an additional five cadets from the Virginia Women s Institute for  Leadership  which is associated with Mary Baldwin College in Staunton  VWIL cadets train with the ROTC units at VMI  For the Navy  the 32 ensigns who commissioned during this academic year represent a sharp jump upward from the 18 who commissioned in 2012 13  Of those 32 ensigns  28 commissioned in May and two did so in December 2013  Two more will commission over the summer  For the Marine Corps  this year s number of 23 new second lieutenants is actually down from the 29 who commissioned in 2013  Of those 23  two commissioned in December 2013  and 21 entered the service in May  Nevertheless  the total number from both branches  Navy and Marine Corps  is higher in 2013 14 than it was the preceding academic year  and even higher than it was the year before that  when a total of 51 commissioned  Cmdr  Randy Zamora  executive officer at VMI s Naval ROTC  believes that the success of the unit is directly related to the Institute s demanding academic and military standards   One of the things that helped us out is that VMI has a very good reputation  said Zamora in explaining the jump in this year s commissioning numbers  Zamora noted that each year a certain number of individuals on scholarship drop out of Navy ROTC programs across the nation  The Navy then redistributes those unused scholarship funds to other ROTC enrolled cadets across the nation  oftentimes with surprisingly good results for VMI  This year  for example  the VMI Naval ROTC nominated 33 cadets for scholarships   and 29 received them  Two more cadets were selected as  advanced standing  which means that although they do not receive scholarship funds  they do receive a monthly stipend and are guaranteed a commission upon graduation   I think the Navy recognizes that at VMI there is a lot on everyone s plate  and if they can remain competitive here compared to the next guy at another institution  then VMI s person is a very good leader and quite capable  Zamora commented  Experiences during spring field training exercises at VMI also boost interest in naval careers  Zamora noted  For the past few years  Navy option ROTC cadets have traveled to the greater Norfolk Fleet Concentration Area to visit the vessels in port  participate in simulator training  and meet enlisted sailors and officers  This year  a highlight for the 4th Class and 3rd Class cadets was simulator training aboard the USS Buttercup  a vessel that Zamora described as a  wet trainer  Cadets on board the Buttercup found themselves waist deep in water as they attempted to use their pipe patching skills to stop the flow and save the ship  Other cadets participated in maritime skills simulators that tested the skills necessary to operate both a surface ship and a submarine  while cadets hoping for careers as Navy aviators trained on flight simulators  It s just this sort of exposure that leads to greater commissioning numbers down the road  Zamora believes  Speaking specifically of the Class of 2014  he noted   They had a lot more interest in commissioning in general  and I think that has a lot to do with FTX    In recent years  they ve done a much more robust FTX  Zamora added   When  the cadets  get  to Norfolk  that piques their interest and they think   Maybe I would want to do that  Maybe I would want to commission  For their spring FTX experience this year  Marine option cadets  deployed  to Natural Bridge  just south of Lexington  in an exercise designed to simulate what Marines would do if they were asked to oversee the election of a new government  The event ended with a live fire event at the North Post range  using more than 10 weapons systems  Among the cadets who commissioned May 15 was Ensign Patrick Pizzaro  who had received orders to the USS America  currently in Mississippi   The four years at VMI went by fast  and now I m less than a month from reporting to my first ship  said Pizzaro   The LHA 6 will be making the trip from Mississippi to San Diego  San Diego will become the ship s new home port  The under way time and the sunny destination made the USS America an attractive billet for newly commissioned ensigns  Ensign Michael Karafotis will be joining Pizzaro aboard  giving LHA 6 the distinction of receiving more than one newly commissioned VMI graduate  VMI graduates will be departing to locations all over the world  from the USS Nitze in Norfolk  Va  to the USS Germantown in Sasebo  Japan  The new Marines will head to The Basic School at Quantico  Va  where they will receive training as provisional rifle platoon leaders and compete for their military occupational specialties  Student Naval aviators will head to Pensacola  Fla  for flight training  and submariners will leave for Charleston  S C  for training in nuclear power   I m extremely proud of the size of our commissioning class  but moreover I m impressed with the quality of their character  said Col  Patrick Looney  commander of the Navy ROTC unit   Every one of these commissionees accepted their NROTC scholarship while our nation was at war and knew full well that as part of their obligation they would or could serve in harm s way    Our nation s naval service is in great hands with the addition of these newly minted ensigns and second lieutenants  By Mary Price IR   June 2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club

helped us out is that VMI has a very good reputation  said Zamora in explaining the jump in this year s commissioning numbers  Zamora noted that each year a certain number of individuals on scholarship drop out of Navy ROTC programs across the nation  The Navy then redistributes those unused scholarship funds to other ROTC enrolled cadets across the nation  oftentimes with surprisingly good results for VMI  This year  for example  the VMI Naval ROTC nominated 33 cadets for scholarships   and 29 received them  Two more cadets were selected as  advanced standing  which means that although they do not receive scholarship funds  they do receive a monthly stipend and are guaranteed a commission upon graduation   I think the Navy recognizes that at VMI there is a lot on everyone s plate  and if they can remain competitive here compared to the next guy at another institution  then VMI s person is a very good leader and quite capable  Zamora commented  Experiences during spring field training exercises at VMI also boost interest in naval careers  Zamora noted  For the past few years  Navy option ROTC cadets have traveled to the greater Norfolk Fleet Concentration Area to visit the vessels in port  participate in simulator training  and meet enlisted sailors and officers  This year  a highlight for the 4th Class and 3rd Class cadets was simulator training aboard the USS Buttercup  a vessel that Zamora described as a  wet trainer  Cadets on board the Buttercup found themselves waist deep in water as they attempted to use their pipe patching skills to stop the flow and save the ship  Other cadets participated in maritime skills simulators that tested the skills necessary to operate both a surface ship and a submarine  while cadets hoping for careers as Navy aviators trained on flight simulators  It s just this sort of exposure that leads to greater commissioning numbers down the road  Zamora believes  Speaking specifically of the Class of 2014  he noted   They had a lot more interest in commissioning in general  and I think that has a lot to do with FTX    In recent years  they ve done a much more robust FTX  Zamora added   When  the cadets  get  to Norfolk  that piques their interest and they think   Maybe I would want to do that  Maybe I would want to commission  For their spring FTX experience this year  Marine option cadets  deployed  to Natural Bridge  just south of Lexington  in an exercise designed to simulate what Marines would do if they were asked to oversee the election of a new government  The event ended with a live fire event at the North Post range  using more than 10 weapons systems  Among the cadets who commissioned May 15 was Ensign Patrick Pizzaro  who had received orders to the USS America  currently in Mississippi   The four years at VMI went by fast  and now I m less than a month from reporting to my first ship  said Pizzaro   The LHA 6 will be making the trip from Mississippi to San Diego  San Diego will become the ship s new home port  The under way time and the sunny destination made the USS America an attractive billet for newly commissioned ensigns  Ensign Michael Karafotis will be joining Pizzaro aboard  giving LHA 6 the distinction of receiving more than one newly commissioned VMI graduate  VMI graduates will be departing to locations all over the world  from the USS Nitze in Norfolk  Va  to the USS Germantown in Sasebo  Japan  The new Marines will head to The Basic School at Quantico  Va  where they will receive training as provisional rifle platoon leaders and compete for their military occupational specialties  Student Naval aviators will head to Pensacola  Fla  for flight training  and submariners will leave for Charleston  S C  for training in nuclear power   I m extremely proud of the size of our commissioning class  but moreover I m impressed with the quality of their character  said Col  Patrick Looney  commander of the Navy ROTC unit   Every one of these commissionees accepted their NROTC scholarship while our nation was at war and knew full well that as part of their obligation they would or could serve in harm s way    Our nation s naval service is in great hands with the addition of these newly minted ensigns and second lieutenants  By Mary Price IR   June 2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX

Leadership   Naval ROTC   Numbers Up for Naval ROTC Commissioning Numbers Up for Naval ROTC Commissioning At the conclusion of the 2013 14 academic year  the Naval ROTC unit at VMI will have hit a milestone  commissioning the highest number of Navy ensigns and Marine Corps second lieutenants in a single year since 2003  A total of 55 VMI graduates have already commissioned this academic year in either the Navy or Marine Corps  or will do so over the summer  Of that number  32 entered the Navy  while 23 entered the Marine Corps  Not included in those numbers are an additional five cadets from the Virginia Women s Institute for  Leadership  which is associated with Mary Baldwin College in Staunton  VWIL cadets train with the ROTC units at VMI  For the Navy  the 32 ensigns who commissioned during this academic year represent a sharp jump upward from the 18 who commissioned in 2012 13  Of those 32 ensigns  28 commissioned in May and two did so in December 2013  Two more will commission

of 23 new second lieutenants is actually down from the 29 who commissioned in 2013  Of those 23  two commissioned in December 2013  and 21 entered the service in May Nevertheless  the total number from both branches  Navy and Marine Corps  is higher in 2013 14 than it was the preceding academic year  and even higher than it was the year before that  when a total of 51 commissioned  Cmdr  Randy Zamora  executive officer at VMI s Naval ROTC  believes that the success of the unit is directly related to the Institute s demanding academic and military standards One of the things that helped us out is that VMI has a very good reputation  said Zamora in explaining the jump in this year s commissioning numbers Zamora noted that each year a certain number of individuals on scholarship drop out of Navy ROTC programs across the nation  The Navy then redistributes those unused scholarship funds to other ROTC enrolled cadets across the nation  oftentimes with surprisingly good results for VMI This year  for example  the VMI Naval ROTC nominated 33 cadets for scholarships   and 29 received them  Two more cadets were selected as  advanced standing  which means that although they do not receive scholarship funds  they do receive a monthly stipend and are guaranteed a commission upon graduation I think the Navy recognizes that at VMI there is a lot on everyone s plate  and if they can remain competitive here compared to the next guy at another institution  then VMI s person is a very good leader and quite capable  Zamora commented Experiences during spring field training exercises at VMI also boost interest in naval careers  Zamora noted  For the past few years  Navy option ROTC cadets have traveled to the greater Norfolk Fleet Concentration Area to visit the vessels in port  participate in simulator training  and meet enlisted sailors and officers  This year  a highlight for the 4th Class and 3rd Class cadets was simulator training aboard the USS Buttercup  a vessel that Zamora described as a  wet trainer  Cadets on board the Buttercup found themselves waist deep in water as they attempted to use their pipe patching skills to stop the flow and save the ship  Other cadets participated in maritime skills simulators that tested the skills necessary to operate both a surface ship and a submarine  while cadets hoping for careers as Navy aviators trained on flight simulators It s just this sort of exposure that leads to greater commissioning numbers down the road  Zamora believes Speaking specifically of the Class of 2014  he noted   They had a lot more interest in commissioning in general  and I think that has a lot to do with FTX    In recent years  they ve done a much more robust FTX Zamora added   When  the cadets  get  to Norfolk  that piques their interest and they think   Maybe I would want to do that  Maybe I would want to commission For their spring FTX experience this year  Marine option cadets  deployed  to Natural Bridge  just south of Lexington  in an exercise designed to simulate what Marines would do if they were asked to oversee the election of a new government  The event ended with a live fire event at the North Post range  using more than 10 weapons systems  Among the cadets who commissioned May 15 was Ensign Patrick Pizzaro  who had received orders to the USS America  currently in Mississippi   The four years at VMI went by fast  and now I m less than a month from reporting to my first ship  said Pizzaro   The LHA 6 will be making the trip from Mississippi to San Diego  San Diego will become the ship s new home port  The under way time and the sunny destination made the USS America an attractive billet for newly commissioned ensigns  Ensign Michael Karafotis will be joining Pizzaro aboard  giving LHA 6 the distinction of receiving more than one newly commissioned VMI graduate VMI graduates will be departing to locations all over the world  from the USS Nitze in Norfolk  Va  to the USS Germantown in Sasebo  Japan  The new Marines will head to The Basic School at Quantico  Va  where they will receive training as provisional rifle platoon leaders and compete for their military occupational specialties  Student Naval aviators will head to Pensacola  Fla  for flight training  and submariners will leave for Charleston  S C  for training in nuclear power I m extremely proud of the size of our commissioning class  but moreover I m impressed with the quality of their character  said Col  Patrick Looney  commander of the Navy ROTC unit   Every one of these commissionees accepted their NROTC scholarship while our nation was at war and knew full well that as part of their obligation they would or could serve in harm s way    Our nation s naval service is in great hands with the addition of these newly minted ensigns and second lieutenants By Mary Price IR   June 2014   VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni VMI
