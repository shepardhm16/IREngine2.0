address to the VMI Leadership Conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  The 500 seat Gillis Theater on the VMI post was filled to capacity with high school and college students and teachers from across the nation as VMI s second biennial Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  opened Monday  The conference concluded yesterday  when the current generation of students took the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity  LEXINGTON  Va  March 7  2012   VMI s Leadership Conference closed late yesterday afternoon with perhaps the most entertaining talk of all  given by a man who has both led and followed with integrity and under fire  Staff Sgt  Salvatore Giunta  who received the Medal of Honor in November 2010 for gallantry  courage  and leadership when his unit was ambushed in the Korengal Valley of eastern Afghanistan on Oct  25  2007  addressed the conference in Cameron Hall  Afterward  he talked with the VMI Corps of Cadets more intimately in Jackson Memorial Hall and then dined with the cadets in Crozet Hall  His most direct piece of advice to those gathered for a conference on lying  cheating  and honor was to do right   Right is not always the easiest path  he told the group before narrating the events that led to his receiving the Medal of Honor   It s up to you whether you re going to choose the easy wrong or the hard right  That s a simple decision  but it s up to us  Giunta explained how  at 18  he had been living a life without direction  making sandwiches at a restaurant  when a TV commercial lured him to the U S  Army recruitment office  where the recruiter told him the truth   He told me straight out  said Giunta   We are a country at war  I was old enough to join the military  if I wanted to make a difference  The idea of making a difference was one Giunta hadn t considered   He knew I was feeding people  but   quipped Giunta regarding his then mission in life  He told how he considered the benefits and drawbacks of enlisting  including having to leave his home town  drawing laughs from the audience when he concluded   I thought   I m in Iowa  I m ready to go away  Enthusiastic about serving his country during his first tour in Afghanistan beginning in March 2005    At that time in my life  I d never prepared for anything as long as I d prepared for war    he was seeing things very differently by August  when he experienced the death of a friend for the first time  He learned lessons that apply across life experience   I learned that the good guys don t always win  and the best team isn t going to come out unscathed and in war there s winners and losers every day  But advice was there in the form of good leaders to listen to   If you did everything you could when it was your time to give  he was told   you can t be upset with yourself   It turned out to be solid truth  As good as gold  We did our job  We did exactly what we were supposed to do  It was a lesson and an approach he would use again and again including on that fateful day during his second tour when his squad was ambushed  Then a specialist and rifle team leader  Giunta followed squad leader Staff Sgt  Erick Gallardo  a leader he believed in  into fire   A good follower  he told the cadets in his Jackson Memorial Hall chat   is someone who believes in you    You can say   Hey  look  we re going to go to hell  and it s going to be scary  and it s going to be dangerous  A good follower will follow you anywhere you want to go  That s because a good leader  said Giunta  leads by actions  which will speak louder than words   You don t have to remind people you re the boss  he told the cadets   Prove to us you re the boss  Lead us like the boss  and you ll be treated like the boss  On that day in October 2007  Giunta expected to follow the staff sergeant into battle only to see him fall wounded  From that point Giunta made the decisions that the ensuring moments required  sometimes acting on his own and sometimes leading members of his team  along the way saving lives   I did nothing special  I did nothing heroic  I did absolutely everything I was trained to do  Giunta  During his time in Afghanistan  Giunta lost 26 friends   That time in my life has made me sadder and madder than anything in my entire life  said Giunta   Because of this  the day the Medal of Honor was put around my neck was the day I felt the weight of the war  The Medal holds deep meaning for Giunta   It has everything to do with all the people who are willing to stand up for what s right  who are willing to choose hard right instead of the easy wrong  who are willing to give of themselves to help someone else   all those men and women who have sacrificed so much so that we could have this life   The Medal of Honor represents the best  the brightest  the strongest  the quickest  and the fastest    On that day I was none of those  I was just one person on that mountain trying to make a bad situation better  Being the one trying to make a bad situation better is something many cadets aspire to  and Giunta several times stated his enthusiasm about visiting VMI and the training VMI cadets receive   I m stoked for all of you  he said  Giunta was the first living recipient of the Medal of Honor for service in Iraq or Afghanistan  the first living service member to be awarded the Medal of Honor since the Vietnam War  and the eighth service member to receive the nation s highest military decoration for valor in Iraq and Afghanistan   Sherri Tombarge  with information provided by John Robertson IV  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
