24450 Biology Meets History in Research Project Institute Report  February 2010 It s not often that a biology professor joins forces with a history major to conduct a research project  but that s been the case for Maj  Anne Alerding since she began mentoring Cadet Travis Daniel last May during the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  Daniel and fellow 2nd Class Cadet Roy Hunter  a biology major  spent last summer collecting data on garlic mustard   Alliaria petiolata   an invasive  biennial herb that poses a severe threat to native plants and animals in forests in much of the eastern and midwestern United States  In fact  they didn t have to go far to collect specimens of the plant  as it grows on forest land owned by both VMI and Washington and Lee University   We re using garlic mustard as a model system to figure out how plants make decisions to allocate limited resources between vital processes such as growing  reproducing  or making defensive or competitive chemicals  said Alerding   Garlic mustard is an excellent choice because it is so pervasive and its genome is similar to Arabidopsis  the model plant for molecular genetic research  This allows us to explore the garlic mustard genome to determine how it produces a toxic chemical that is killing soil fungi that are beneficial to native tree species such as maples and ashes  While garlic mustard has been in the United States since the 1800s  Alerding said there is little research published on exactly how the plant affects the forest biosystem and how best to stop its spread  She hopes the work she s been doing with Daniel and Hunter may shed more light on a growing problem  Last summer Hunter concentrated his research on how the plant affects insects and spiders that live in the soil surrounding it  Daniel focused on how the life cycle might influence garlic mustard s production of chemical toxins and whether the toxins come from the root or the leaves of the plant  Their work has continued through independent study projects  Alerding  who taught both students in an introductory biology course  said she approached Daniel about the project because of his analytical and research skills and because he is patient and detail oriented  Those traits came in handy last summer when equipment broke down in the lab and Daniel had to troubleshoot problems to keep the project moving along  By contrast  Hunter loves the outdoors and enjoyed his work in the field  Despite sporadic weather conditions that tested his patience  he enjoyed the trial and error process of collecting specimens and studying the plant in its environment  The garlic mustard project has piqued his interest in environmental science  as well as in conducting research   I m really enjoying the blend of research with field work  said Hunter   This project has given me new ideas about my future  I can see myself researching fish kills on the Shenandoah River or focusing on pollution or run off issues   perhaps a career as an environmental scientist or working for a wildlife refuge  While Daniel is sticking with his history major  he foresees biology playing a continuing role in his future   I plan on commissioning in the Army following graduation  but I can see myself teaching history or biology one day  he said   I didn t like the way biology was taught at my high school  perhaps I might make a difference to students by teaching at a high school or community college  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents
