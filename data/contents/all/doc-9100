Optical Multiplexer by Paul Kuwick and Tom Largi  05 Frequency division multiplexing is a technique to combine multiple different signals onto a single communications line  such as on a computer network or telephone wire  Although the mathematical derivations are an advanced ECE concept  we created a microprocessor controlled multimedia demonstration that intuitively shows how multiple signals can be combined  transmitted on a single channel  and then separated  Specifically  we programmed a microcontroller to control the individual notes played by a heavily modified stripped electronic keyboard to recite the Top Gun theme  Electronic signals are also sent to two powerful lights to flash in synchronization to the audio sounds   blue that flashes with each bass note  and red that flashes to each melody note  The melody note light passes through a red chromatic filter  and the bass light passes through a blue filter  The lights are then combined using a half silvered mirror  The combined signal is sent out of the transmitting unit using a 1  diameter acrylic light pipe  An individual will see each light blink in a different rhythmic pattern while viewing the combined signal of both lights on the single optical pipe  The audio signal is played on speakers to reinforce the concept of seeing two signals being multiplexed onto a single channel  The receiving unit  built of clear acrylic  takes the output of the pipe  and divides the combined signal into each of its original component parts using half silvered mirrors and light filters  thus reinforcing the concept that two different signals can be combined onto a single line  then re divided with no information loss  Steve Lee  02 initiated this project  however  he was unable to finish the project before he graduated  Cadets Paul Kuwik  05 and Tom Largi  05 finished his project with Major Squire as their academic advisor  The Kuwik and Largi received a Wetmore research grant to develop the project  and presented their work at the 2003 Virginia Military Institute Undergraduate Research Symposium  The demonstration has been accepted by the Western Virginia Museum of Science and will be displayed there in August of 2003  Back
