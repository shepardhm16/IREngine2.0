faculty and staff  and ladies and gentlemen of the Corps of Cadets  Welcome to this morning s Founders Day convocation  which marks a significant milestone in the history of the Institute  Today  VMI celebrates the 175th anniversary of its founding  The story of the beginning of VMI in the state arsenal here in Lexington on a wintry Monday  11 November  in 1839  has been told many times  What may be less well known is that the school was officially created two years earlier  in 1837  but had to be postponed because of the economic panic of that year  a financial downturn that strongly resembles what this nation has just endured  It s very possible that the Founders   members of our first Board of Visitors and Smith  Crozet  and Preston   might have abandoned the idea of founding a military college under such difficult circumstances  but they persisted and succeeded  And the Institute has lived on  through many other financial crises  Civil War  the Great Depression  and two World Wars to reach a level of excellence that even the forward looking Founders could never have imagined  Today s convocation also occurs on Veteran s Day  once known as Armistice Day because it marked the signing of the armistice between the Allies of World War I and Germany that temporarily halted the fighting on the Western Front  The signing took place at eleven o clock of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918  One year later  in November of 1919  President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed November 11    Armistice Day  One hundred years ago  in August of 1914  the war  which many thought would be over before Christmas  but lasted four terrible years  had only recently begun  The United States did not enter until April of 1917  but the war had an enormous effect on VMI  Over 85 percent of all alumni between the ages of 17 and 40 served in the armed forces   over 1 800 individuals  VMI had graduated only 1036 men between 1887 and 1917  VMI s role in the war also marked   symbolically   the Institute s final and complete  re integration  into the mainstream of the American military after the Civil War  A number of well known soldiers of that war had VMI connections  including Generals Charles Kilbourne  John A  Lejeune  George C  Marshall  and George S  Patton  Today s VMI Founders Day  therefore   coming on the 175th anniversary of our college and Institute  and the 100th anniversary of the beginning of  The Great War  is very special  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents

staff  and ladies and gentlemen of the Corps of Cadets  Welcome to this morning s Founders Day convocation  which marks a significant milestone in the history of the Institute  Today  VMI celebrates the 175th anniversary of its founding  The story of the beginning of VMI in the state arsenal here in Lexington on a wintry Monday  11 November  in 1839  has been told many times  What may be less well known is that the school was officially created two years earlier  in 1837  but had to be postponed because of the economic panic of that year  a financial downturn that strongly resembles what this nation has just endured  It s very possible that the Founders   members of our first Board of Visitors and Smith  Crozet  and Preston   might have abandoned the idea of founding a military college under such difficult circumstances  but they persisted and succeeded  And the Institute has lived on  through many other financial crises  Civil War  the Great Depression  and two World Wars to reach a level of excellence that even the forward looking Founders could never have imagined  Today s convocation also occurs on Veteran s Day  once known as Armistice Day because it marked the signing of the armistice between the Allies of World War I and Germany that temporarily halted the fighting on the Western Front  The signing took place at eleven o clock of the eleventh day of the eleventh month of 1918  One year later  in November of 1919  President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed November 11    Armistice Day  One hundred years ago  in August of 1914  the war  which many thought would be over before Christmas  but lasted four terrible years  had only recently begun  The United States did not enter until April of 1917  but the war had an enormous effect on VMI  Over 85 percent
