of funders are   attracted to projects with links between academics and community  private and public  and also service oriented projects  And though the ultimate goal of creating a practical method of recycling plastic by using it in concrete will require much more research  deHart believes it is worth pursuing  Because concrete plants may be located in communities like Lexington  that are somewhat isolated from shipping routes and more populous areas  using plastic to make concrete may be an excellent way to recycle plastic locally instead of shipping it elsewhere   Concrete has a long life compared to other less durable goods that plastic might be turned into    What we re doing here  we re melting at low heat and then we re shredding  so that might be less energy intensive than other uses for recycled plastic  such as making fleece jackets    The more opportunities we have in general to recover this resource  this unwanted plastic  the better off we are   I am very excited

McDonald s project was one of two that were part of an initiative by the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research to fund research with a service oriented component  He worked with a member of the VMI physical plant staff who is tasked with helping to reduce the amount of waste VMI sends to landfills  Cooperative efforts like these enhance the practical side of research   It s definitely a bridge I think we should be strengthening  between facilities and curriculum  said Maj  Jenny deHart  physical plant sustainability coordinator who served as one of McDonald s project mentors   It s one that other universities are developing as they look to achieve goals in sustainability and other goals  including funding  A lot of funders are   attracted to projects with links between academics and community  private and public  and also service oriented projects  And though the ultimate goal of creating a practical method of recycling plastic by using it in concrete will require much more research  deHart believes it is worth pursuing  Because concrete plants may be located in communities like Lexington  that are somewhat isolated from shipping routes and more populous areas  using plastic to make concrete may be an excellent way to recycle plastic locally instead of shipping it elsewhere   Concrete has a long life compared to other less durable goods that plastic might be turned into    What we re doing here  we re melting at low heat and then we re shredding  so that might be less energy intensive than other uses for recycled plastic  such as making fleece jackets    The more opportunities we have in general to recover this resource  this unwanted plastic  the better off we are   I am very excited about this year s SURI projects and extremely proud of all the students  I have an extra special place in my heart for the service oriented projects  because I have always thought this is the kind of activity for which VMI should be known  said Lt  Col  Keith Kline  VCUR director   It is consistent with the citizen soldier ideal to which we aspire and has the potential to both positively impact society and transform the lives of our cadets  Also working on a service oriented SURI project this summer was Michelle McCusker  14  who worked with Col  Christina McDonald on  Rhetoric  Community  Advocacy  Making the Case for Sustainable Health Care in Rockbridge County   I love that  while these two cadets  research endeavors are disparate in focus  content  and methodology  they share the opportunity to make a real  tangible difference in the local community  concluded Kline      SURI Service Projects Make  Tangible Difference  Institute Report  August 2012 John McDonald s project was one of two that were part of an initiative by the VMI
