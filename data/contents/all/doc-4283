graduating its first majors with the concentration at the end of the 2009 10 academic year  The Department of Physics and Astronomy has begun offering coursework toward its nuclear energy concentration this semester  with its first graduates mostly likely in the Class of 2015  Mechanical engineering majors seeking the concentration must complete the mechanical engineering curriculum and select two additional upper level classes from the following three  ME 431 Power Plant Design  PY 344 Nuclear Physics  and PY453 Nuclear Reactor Engineering  Three other courses  ME 311 Thermodynamics I  ME 313 Thermodynamics II  and ME 314 Fluid Dynamics or CE 309 Fluid Mechanics are also required  but are part of the ME major curriculum  Five courses are required for physics majors seeking that department s nuclear energy concentration  ME 311 Thermodynamics I  ME 314 Fluid Mechanics  ME 336 Heat and Mass Transfer  PY 344 Nuclear Physics and either PY 453 Nuclear Reactor Engineering or ME 431 Power Plant Design  All physics majors take a two semester Modern Physics sequence  said Col  John Thompson  professor and head of the physics department  That sequence establishes the basic principles on which nuclear engineering is founded  Engineers and physicists  said Thompson  both acquire a good technical background   The courses are different  but the basic skill sets are pretty similar  he said  Capt  Bob McMasters  professor of mechanical engineering who teaches the Power Plant Design course  notes that though career paths of mechanical engineers and physicists with the nuclear energy concentration are similar  physicists might be more likely to be employed in reactor design and mechanical engineers by operational plants  In adding the concentration  both departments seem to be riding a trend   I think part of it is because of the nuclear renaissance    the renewed interest in nuclear power in our country  said McMasters   Nuclear energy is not green  but it is carbon free  you don t generate CO2   greenhouse gases  said Thompson   The big thing about nuclear  coal  and petroleum is the energy density  You ve got 7 billion people on the face of the planet  and they d all like to live like Americans  That requires a great deal of energy  You can t supply that energy through renewables  The fuel value of a single uranium pellet less than an inch long is equivalent to that of a ton of coal  said McMasters   There s just a lot of energy waiting to be released  And  said Thompson   aside from the issue of growth  there s opportunity  for employment  because of the  graying  of the staff   Since it has been looked upon as a dying industry since  the Three Mile Island accident in  1979  there have been fewer and fewer new people going into it  said McMasters   Very few of the plants have closed  and the people who work there are retiring    They re desperately looking for ways to fill that coming void  Demand is also felt in both VMI departments from cadets interested in commissioning into the U S  Navy s nuclear power program  Bonuses await cadets who choose to operate the nuclear reactor plants on Navy submarines and aircraft carriers  said McMasters  himself a former  Navy nuc   We ve had a fair amount of interest  in the concentration  said McMasters  who has taken his students on tours of Dominion s North Anna nuclear power plant in Louisa County  Va  cadets who in some cases have ended up employed by the plant after graduation  Thompson said the concentration in the physics department emphasizes the  applied  aspect of the physics major   Sometimes people associate applied things exclusively with engineering  said Thompson  and assume physics is a purely theoretical field   That s not really valid  Our program itself is very applied and very hands on  he said  in terms of both lab work and faculty areas of interest   Physicists do a lot of different things  concluded Thompson   not just work in national labs or at NASA  And now  at VMI  they ll be able to formalize the interest which has caused the Nuclear Reactor Engineering elective to fill consistently into a concentration on their majors    By Sherri Tombarge  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets
