and video Feb  14  Elections amid Unrest So why is perhaps the biggest challenger in a democratic election  Muhammadu Buhari  a former dictator  Why is Goodluck Jonathan perhaps favored to win in spite of all the violence  View download video of this section  View download transcript of this section Hentz  The reason why it may appear that Goodluck Jonathan has an early advantage would be that he has control over the patronage resources  he has control to some extent over the media and outflow of information  so he ll use his considerable resources to make it appear as if he s the likely winner  I probably would not bet on that being the actual fact  Gire  On the contrary  many would argue that unless the ruling government does something underhanded he stands very little chance of winning the election    What many people don t realize is that sometimes the general Nigerian public yearns for military intervention in the face of just reckless corruption with impunity as is happening just right now  Security is usually a very important issue for any country  and there has been insecurity for years    The impression therefore is that being a strong military leader  perhaps that s the kind of person that will be needed at this particular point in time to tackle the insurgency  Hentz  We in the West tend to think they  you  can telescope political development and think that you can get everything at once    He  Buhari  may have been a dictator  but if he s elected  he s no longer a dictator he s an elected president first of all  and second of all the notion that he is a military man may resonate throughout the country and give them the stability that they need    Who s Fighting Whom  Southern Nigeria  which is primarily responsible for Nigeria s status as Africa s biggest producer of oil  is far from the center of violence  Nigeria s Muslim north  and Boko Haram  whose leader   has referenced the  glory days of northern Nigeria s medieval Muslim empires   Julia Payne  Reuters  Nigerians face killings  hunger in Boko Haram s  state  Jan  19  2015  He seems to be at war with Nigeria s Muslim center    Who s fighting who and where does this come from    View download video of this section  View download transcript of this section Hentz  The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram  So why    The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative    So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously  both   both in peripheral areas far from the center   and in Nigerian politics  the periphery  whether it s the south or the north  have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake  Gire  It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta  The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control  they ve been ignored for so long    And it s an environmental disaster  And because of the complacency of the central government    efforts to clean up   have not been adequate  leaving the people  some of whom are fishermen  unable to engage in very fulfilling day to day sustenance  Because Boko Haram s intentions are to Islamize the whole country  including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south  And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north  guess what their next target is going to be  So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries  In the early days of Boko Haram  when they emerged in 2002  they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban    that s why other Muslims are not safe  if they re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or as colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values    Hentz  Within Nigeria  some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta  although it provides 98 percent of the state s revenues  But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time  While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency    there s now side by side   with that a warlord conflict  what we call a war economy  And so there are insurgency groups   and there s an alphabet soup list of them   who actually make money off the conflict through  in particular  bunkering where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines  Gire  What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigeria not so much as just Christian Muslim per se but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  Hentz  And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad  into Cameroon  into Niger  as it is  you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons    It s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders    These transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks  These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it s almost impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return    They re just adapting what they want to do  their trading networks  their conflicts  to age old Trans Sahel trading routes and alliances  And it s a very fluid situation  Gire  In fact some people have used foreign fighters   for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria    They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of    Hentz  What we re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict  not a Nigerian conflict  And recently the United States is   celebrating   that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram  So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface  The Chadian Army  though  is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims    which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active  We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here  Gire  In fact  in some ways you can draw parallels with what s going on with ISIL in Syria  Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth  Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it  So at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites  Guess what  It has now morphed out of control  And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened  Training the Trainers in Niger Jim  I know you just returned from Niger    Weren t you working this problem over there from some angle    View download video of this section  View download transcript of this section Hentz  My trip to Niger was to what they call  train the trainers    Just days after I left Niger they had riots   as a response to what France was doing and the cartoons and burnt down some churches and set some hotels on fire  I haven t found out if my hotel was set on fire  I don t know if I want to know if my hotel was set on fire  But Niger is a strong American ally right now    But the same substratum exists there as in northern Nigeria  These young men that are easily recruited into these sort of extremist movements because their lives just flat out are not very good and they see this as an option  maybe the only option  It s remarkable how I m there working as a representative of the United States government helping to promote U S Nigerien relations and cooperation specifically in the fight against Islamic terrorism in the Trans Sahel and four days later there s riots in the capital because of their reaction to the political cartoons depicting the prophet in France  So it s a tinderbox  This part of the world is a tinderbox  Reflections on Life in Nigeria James  you also have spent a lot time actually in Nigeria and have just returned    And you ve spent a lot of time   working with developing higher education there  and I know you ve noted a real thirst for it    There must be some people that go to work every day there  that try to live regular lives  and all of this is happening around them  So do you have things to say about what Nigeria s like now    View download video of this section  View download transcript of this section Gire  You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is  I would imagine  one of the most optimistic persons out there  They have ambitions for education  for raising families  for having their children as well as themselves be successful  Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram  a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet  which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important  Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption  particularly in the central government  then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there  The president  upon responding to aspects of corruption  will say something like this    Everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria  when you build a very good house  you re viewed as being corrupt  which is surprising because if you re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50 000 naira a month  which is not that much  if you don t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on  and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house  it has to be labeled as something  Where did you get the money from  For the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition  that  has developed  People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard working people  some of the most resourceful people out there  that the government has been in the way  To some extent    corruption  has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on  but it s a matter of magnitude    What has happened right now  which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable    an example will be somebody who holds office  and  has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract maybe for a bridge  100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge  None  Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality    And even for Nigerians  that is too much  Which is why  Muhammadu  Buhari   is out there  Remember  a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians  Buhari s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria  OK  Buhari  when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago  laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there  He said   I was a military general and a head of state  I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me  People are just fed up  In other words  Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption  whereby  20 million have been allotted to build  say  a political science building at the university  you actually see it built  maybe it took  15 million to build it  people say   OK  maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that  To some extent that has been accepted  What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted  Can Conflict in Nigeria Threaten the United States  Is Boko Haram and maybe more broadly the Nigerian unrest  is that a threat to the West    View download video of this section  View download transcript of this section Hentz  I think we re pretty well aware  ISIL s got  the  front page  France grabbed the front page  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen s up there  but I think you re going to see over the next year that not just Boko Haram again but the whole Trans Sahel area is going to be a high priority for U S  national security  Gire  The situation in France killed a few people  at that same time 2 000 people were killed in Nigeria  In fact even other African countries  that  sometimes refrain from criticizing Nigeria came down hard against Jonathan because he was one of the first leaders to send words of sympathy to France and had not mentioned a word about the 2 000 people that were killed in his own country  The activities  of Boko Haram  are becoming not only more explosive but more sophisticated  The general belief now is that they have training links with Al Qaeda  So if we re interested in Al Qaeda in Yemen  we ought to be interested in Boko Haram in Nigeria   because eventually  there s going to be that link  The folks who carried out the attacks on France and so on were not foreigners  they were French citizens  who had influence there  They come back with the passports of their own countries    And so it s in everyone s interest to recognize this for the serious problem that it is and ensure that it does not spread  because otherwise it will splinter into these little fragments that are very difficult to contain from a broad national attack perspective  You can t take the U S  Army against a few individuals who just returned from Syria  one of whom is in Kansas  one of whom is in Maine  another of whom is from a different part of the country  Hentz  All over the news right now is this notion that ISIL and AQAP  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula  are going to start trying to outbid each other for the more outstanding terrorist event   you can call this the CNN effect on steroids  right  If you want to get on the news  you have to be the one who does the most spectacular event  I don t know why they don t bring Boko Haram in here too  Shekau likes to be on TV  He likes publicity  and in fact  it s kind of we re back to James s 2 000  It s  look at me  I just killed 2 000 people and you re not even looking at me  I m guessing   he s going back saying   Oh what do I have to do now  to get on TV  right  Not only do we have to take a regional approach  we have to take a holistic approach  We have to understand in a globalized world how events in France affect Niger  how events in Tunisia affect Libya  how events in Libya affect Nigeria  how events in Yemen affect Boko Haram  This is not just a regional challenge  this is a global challenge  from Minnesota to Paris to London to Nigeria  A Limit to How Much You Can Ignore Do either one of you have anything you want to add in thinking about the goings on in Nigeria  View download transcript of this section Gire  The most important thing in the foreseeable future  which is in about three weeks  is the forthcoming election  It has the potential to change  I think  maybe things for the better   A change at the center would be a signal that there s a limit to how much you can ignore  And so whichever government that comes in will be cognizant that the other guys  we kicked them out because they didn t do so good  So they ll be more likely to at least try to address it even if for the selfish purpose of trying to retain power  View download complete transcript View download complete video Copyright   2015 Virginia Military Institute  For academic and news media use
