Focus on Leadership Vision 2039   Focus on Leadership Vision 2039 s master plan aims at improving the academic  military  and athletic programs and the infrastructure of the Institute to enhance cadet leadership development and the environment in which it takes place  The Institute s time tested  hands on environment develops leaders by combining education  experience  and training  Vision 2039 advances and enhances that environment  But there is much more to that environment than courses  training programs  and physical facilities  For leadership is more than a skill  It has moral and ethical dimensions  It is a question of character  The character of the individual cadet is directly influenced by the prevailing culture of the Institute  and Vision 2039 addresses this important aspect of VMI  The way cadets   men and women  live together and work together while at VMI lays the foundation for the way they will live and work throughout their lives  The culture of VMI develops in cadets the highest standards of honor  respect  civility  self discipline  and professionalism  From Vision 2039 spring many initiatives and specific plans   from architects  drawings for new buildings  to refinements in the academic curriculum  to increased technology  to a Post on display that resonates with history and a Corps of proud  disciplined  and civil cadets  In the end  it will have positioned VMI in today s world to continue to fulfill its mission into the future  The Virginia Military Institute believes that the measure of a college lies in the quality and performance of its graduates and their contributions to society  Therefore  it is the mission of the Virginia Military Institute to produce educated  honorable men and women  prepared for the varied work of civil life  imbued with love of learning  confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership  possessing a high sense of public service  advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system  and ready as citizen soldiers to defend their country in time of national peril  To accomplish this result  the Virginia Military Institute shall provide to qualified young men and women undergraduate education of highest quality   embracing engineering  science  and the arts   conducted in and facilitated by the unique VMI system of military discipline  To fulfill the mission far into the 21st century  VMI has developed 14 points upon which to deliver excellence  These are the broad goals that directed a close self examination of all aspects of the Institute  This work included the efforts of the Board of Visitors  faculty  staff  alumni  and cadets and focused on four principal areas  the academic  the military  the athletic  and the cultural physical environment at the Institute  From that effort flow scores of large and small undertakings that are moving VMI into the future  Themes of commonality of purpose  synchronization  and integration guide those undertakings  When taken together  the focus areas and themes create a synergy that provides a remarkable education for life  ACADEMIC VMI is first and foremost a college  Vision 2039 s distinctive educational goals and strategies guide VMI in its journey to be the premier undergraduate college in America  A reformed core curriculum provides the educational foundation upon which to build the essential characteristics of the citizen soldier  Focusing on a limited number of high quality majors  minors  and interdisciplinary programs ensures the overall excellence of programs  The Institute will continue its tradition of educating to meet the needs of a changing nation by establishing a more balanced distribution between engineering  science  and the arts  with more than half the degrees awarded in engineering and the sciences  Vision 2039 promotes opportunities to broaden the perspectives of cadets  A dynamic Distinguished Lecturer Series challenges and informs the Corps  The Institute s global engagement through its international programs is directed to regions and cultures that are most important to the future of our country  Our focus on interdisciplinary problems with immediate real world application further develops critical and creative thinking skills  The heart of the Institute s academic program   indeed  infusing the VMI education in its broadest sense   is leadership development  Vision 2039 helps ensure that VMI s graduates will be broadly educated  adaptive leaders of character who con tribute substantially to their communities  their nation  and the world  A major academic goal is to ensure that every VMI cadet  regardless of academic major  is properly prepared for leadership and citizenship in the 21st century  Innovative programs  small classes with talented and engaging faculty members  and partnerships with the best graduate schools in America promote open ended inquiry as a central element of the VMI curriculum  Vision 2039 builds upon and incorporates the improved and innovative academic programs supported by the Jackson Hope effort  MILITARY A structured military environment that places responsibilities on cadets and offers numerous leadership opportunities adds value to the VMI diploma  Vision 2039 reinforces the system of immersing young men and women in a military culture that includes the barracks  the parade ground  and four years of ROTC participation  That culture emphasizes teamwork  engenders civility and respect for others  develops commitment to service  and produces the selflessness and sense of honor that are the hallmarks of the citizen soldier  A key goal of Vision 2039 is to increase the percentage of graduates accepting commissions in the Armed Forces  whether active duty or reserve  Accepting a commission is not required of graduates  but VMI prepares its graduates for successful military service  Based on VMI s tradition of educating citizen soldiers  the Institute will encourage cadets to pursue commissions in the National Guard and other Reserve components of the U S  military  an option that will allow them to serve their country while pursuing their chosen professions  Service life broadens a young graduate through travel and exposure to foreign cultures  It grows leaders by placing in their hands responsibility for the welfare of other young Americans as well as the care and readiness of major pieces of materiel  ATHLETICS Cadets who participate in varsity sports expect to make the commitment in time and effort that competing at the varsity level entails  At the same time  they must participate fully in the uncompromising educational and military components of the Institute  Cadets who do not participate in varsity athletics are expected to participate in club or intramural athletic programs  Athletic competition is a means of developing individual physical skills and team skills that will benefit every cadet throughout his or her life  In addition  it is a highly effective means of developing leadership skills  Vision 2039 continues VMI s traditional emphasis on athletics as a key cadet development tool and recognizes that athletic competition is an integral component of the VMI educational experience  It does so by expanding the athletic opportunities at all levels to meet the needs and interests of cadets with a massive increase in structured club sports  NCAA sports  and intramurals  it creates new athletic facilities and upgrades older facilities  and it provides the resources to make those opportunities effective  Cultural   Physical Environment The spartan conditions of life at VMI and the requirement to live among peers in a close environment combine with the Institute s rigid military structure to mold cadets of character  For generations of alumni  this is perhaps the most valuable gift   and the heaviest responsibility   bestowed by a VMI education  Vision 2039 is not a construction plan  it is a leadership plan  However construction of new facilities and the renovations of older buildings on Post are essential components of Vision 2039 all the same  They provide a foundation for excellent programs  They encourage pride and set standards that impact the thinking and attitudes of cadets  Just as the proud traditions and history of VMI influence the culture of the Corps of Cadets  so too do the physical facilities in which the Corps lives  learns  trains  and competes  Indeed  the unique architectural flavor of the VMI Post helps set the tone for all that happens on it and communicates the extraordinary expectations that the Commonwealth of Virginia and the nation have for cadets and for the Institute itself  The facilities necessary to provide an education that thoroughly prepares cadets to meet the challenges of the 21st century are far more complex than they were in 1839  In fact  they are more complex than they were in 1989  when the Institute opened the newest academic building on Post  Vision 2039 aims to maintain the historic atmosphere of the Post as it develops the modern  technologically advanced facilities VMI needs to prepare cadets for lives of success  service  and leadership  The Corps will expand to 1 500 cadets with the addition of a new barracks  giving VMI the flexibility to fully modernize the existing structures  A new Leadership and Ethics Center will allow the Institute to become a leader in issues of the day by providing a venue for conferences and events of statewide and national prominence  A formal leadership program emanating from this facility will enhance cadet learning  civility  and ethics  New athletic facilities  including a new field house and aquatics center  will allow VMI to proudly host significant athletic and training events while also providing resources that will enhance the facilities available to citizens in Lexington and Rockbridge County  Integrating more thoroughly at the state and national levels on one hand and the local community on the other are vital to enhance and secure VMI s reputation as a valued public asset  As part of Vision 2039  new construction and modernization of existing facilities accommodate a larger Corps of Cadets and expanded VMI capabilities  A new Leadership and Ethics Center provides facilities for major conferences  Post functions  and a concentration on leadership programs synchronized across four years of a cadetship  Modern facilities at the Gray Minor Stadium anchor expansion of athletic facilities in the North Post area  The traditional appearance of Crozet Hall will be retained in an expanded and modernized mess hall that accommodates 1 500 cadets at a single seating and features an expanded kitchen and an air conditioned dining area  A large field house on North Main Street with Olympic indoor track capabilities will provide an all weather sports facility for cadets  Download a copy VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams

time tested  hands on environment develops leaders by combining education  experience  and training  Vision 2039 advances and enhances that environment  But there is much more to that environment than courses  training programs  and physical facilities  For leadership is more than a skill  It has moral and ethical dimensions  It is a question of character  The character of the individual cadet is directly influenced by the prevailing culture of the Institute  and Vision 2039 addresses this important aspect of VMI  The way cadets   men and women  live together and work together while at VMI lays the foundation for the way they will live and work throughout their lives  The culture of VMI develops in cadets the highest standards of honor  respect  civility  self discipline  and professionalism  From Vision 2039 spring many initiatives and specific plans   from architects  drawings for new buildings  to refinements in the academic curriculum  to increased technology  to a Post on display that resonates with history and a Corps of proud  disciplined  and civil cadets  In the end  it will have positioned VMI in today s world to continue to fulfill its mission into the future  The Virginia Military Institute believes that the measure of a college lies in the quality and performance of its graduates and their contributions to society  Therefore  it is the mission of the Virginia Military Institute to produce educated  honorable men and women  prepared for the varied work of civil life  imbued with love of learning  confident in the functions and attitudes of leadership  possessing a high sense of public service  advocates of the American democracy and free enterprise system  and ready as citizen soldiers to defend their country in time of national peril  To accomplish this result  the Virginia Military Institute shall provide to qualified young men and women undergraduate education of highest quality   embracing engineering  science  and the arts   conducted in and facilitated by the unique VMI system of military discipline  To fulfill the mission far into the 21st century  VMI has developed 14 points upon which to deliver excellence  These are the broad goals that directed a close self examination of all aspects of the Institute  This work included the efforts of the Board of Visitors  faculty  staff  alumni  and cadets and focused on four principal areas  the academic  the military  the athletic  and the cultural physical environment at the Institute  From that effort flow scores of large and small undertakings that are moving VMI into the future  Themes of commonality of purpose  synchronization  and integration guide those undertakings  When taken together  the focus areas and themes create a synergy that provides a remarkable education for life  ACADEMIC VMI is first and foremost a college  Vision 2039 s distinctive educational goals and strategies guide VMI in its journey to be the premier undergraduate college in America  A reformed core curriculum provides the educational foundation upon which to build the essential characteristics of the citizen soldier  Focusing on a limited number of high quality majors  minors  and interdisciplinary programs ensures the overall excellence of programs  The Institute will continue its tradition of educating to meet the needs of a changing nation by establishing a more balanced distribution between engineering  science  and the arts  with more than half the degrees awarded in engineering and the sciences  Vision 2039 promotes opportunities to broaden the perspectives of cadets  A dynamic Distinguished Lecturer Series challenges and informs the Corps  The Institute s global engagement through its international programs is directed to regions and cultures that are most important to the future of our country  Our focus on interdisciplinary problems with immediate real world application further develops critical and creative thinking skills  The heart of the Institute s academic program   indeed  infusing the VMI education in its broadest sense   is leadership development  Vision 2039 helps ensure that VMI s graduates will be broadly educated  adaptive leaders of character who con tribute substantially to their communities  their nation  and the world  A major academic goal is to ensure that every VMI cadet  regardless of academic major  is properly prepared for leadership and citizenship in the 21st century  Innovative programs  small classes with talented and engaging faculty members  and partnerships with the best graduate schools in America promote open ended inquiry as a central element of the VMI curriculum  Vision 2039 builds upon and incorporates the improved and innovative academic programs supported by the Jackson Hope effort  MILITARY A structured military environment that places responsibilities on cadets and offers numerous leadership opportunities adds value to the VMI diploma  Vision 2039 reinforces the system of immersing young men and women in a military culture that includes the barracks  the parade ground  and four years of ROTC participation  That culture emphasizes teamwork  engenders civility and respect for others  develops commitment to service  and produces the selflessness and sense of honor that are the hallmarks of the citizen soldier  A key goal of Vision 2039 is to increase the percentage of graduates accepting commissions in the Armed Forces  whether active duty or reserve  Accepting a commission is not required of graduates  but VMI prepares its graduates for successful military service  Based on VMI s tradition of educating citizen soldiers  the Institute will encourage cadets to pursue commissions in the National Guard and other Reserve components of the U S  military  an option that will allow them to serve their country while pursuing their chosen professions  Service life broadens a young graduate through travel and exposure to foreign cultures  It grows leaders by placing in their hands responsibility for the welfare of other young Americans as well as the care and readiness of major pieces of materiel  ATHLETICS Cadets who participate in varsity sports expect to make the commitment in time and effort that competing at the varsity level entails  At the same time  they must participate fully in the uncompromising educational and military components of the Institute  Cadets who do not participate in varsity athletics are expected to participate in club or intramural athletic programs  Athletic competition is a means of developing individual physical skills and team skills that will benefit every cadet throughout his or her life  In addition  it is a highly effective means of developing leadership skills  Vision 2039 continues VMI s traditional emphasis on athletics as a key cadet development tool and recognizes that athletic competition is an integral component of the VMI educational experience  It does so by expanding the athletic opportunities at all levels to meet the needs and interests of cadets with a massive increase in structured club sports  NCAA sports  and intramurals  it creates new athletic facilities and upgrades older facilities  and it provides the resources to make those opportunities effective  Cultural   Physical Environment The spartan conditions of life at VMI and the requirement to live among peers in a close environment combine with the Institute s rigid military structure to mold cadets of character  For generations of alumni  this is perhaps the most valuable gift   and the heaviest responsibility   bestowed by a VMI education  Vision 2039 is not a construction plan  it is a leadership plan  However construction of new facilities and the renovations of older buildings on Post are essential components of Vision 2039 all the same  They provide a foundation for excellent programs  They encourage pride and set standards that impact the thinking and attitudes of cadets  Just as the proud traditions and history of VMI influence the culture of the Corps of Cadets  so too do the physical facilities in which the Corps lives  learns  trains  and competes  Indeed  the unique architectural flavor of the VMI Post helps set the tone for all that happens on it and communicates the extraordinary expectations that the Commonwealth of Virginia and the nation have for cadets and for the Institute itself  The facilities necessary to provide an education that thoroughly prepares cadets to meet the challenges of the 21st century are far more complex than they were in 1839  In fact  they are more complex than they were in 1989  when the Institute opened the newest academic building on Post  Vision 2039 aims to maintain the historic atmosphere of the Post as it develops the modern  technologically advanced facilities VMI needs to prepare cadets for lives of success  service  and leadership  The Corps will expand to 1 500 cadets with the addition of a new barracks  giving VMI the flexibility to fully modernize the existing structures  A new Leadership and Ethics Center will allow the Institute to become a leader in issues of the day by providing a venue for conferences and events of statewide and national prominence  A formal leadership program emanating from this facility will enhance cadet learning  civility  and ethics  New athletic facilities  including a new field house and aquatics center  will allow VMI to proudly host significant athletic and training events while also providing resources that will enhance the facilities available to citizens in Lexington and Rockbridge County  Integrating more thoroughly at the state and national levels on one hand and the local community on the other are vital to enhance and secure VMI s reputation as a valued public asset  As part of Vision 2039  new construction and modernization of existing facilities accommodate a larger Corps of Cadets and expanded VMI capabilities  A new Leadership and Ethics Center provides facilities for major conferences  Post functions  and a concentration on leadership programs synchronized across four years of a cadetship  Modern facilities at the Gray Minor Stadium anchor expansion of athletic facilities in the North Post area  The traditional appearance of Crozet Hall will be retained in an expanded and modernized mess hall that accommodates 1 500 cadets at a single seating and features an expanded kitchen and an air conditioned dining area  A large field house on North Main Street with Olympic indoor track capabilities will provide an all weather sports facility for cadets  Download a

 they must participate fully in the uncompromising educational and military components of the Institute  Cadets who do not participate in varsity athletics are expected to participate in club or intramural athletic programs  Athletic competition is a means of developing individual physical skills and team skills that will benefit every cadet throughout his or her life  In addition  it is a highly effective means of developing leadership skills  Vision 2039 continues VMI s traditional emphasis on athletics as a key cadet development tool and recognizes that athletic competition is an integral component of the VMI educational experience  It does so by expanding the athletic opportunities at all levels to meet the needs and interests of cadets with a massive increase in structured

generations of alumni  this is perhaps the most valuable gift   and the heaviest responsibility   bestowed by a VMI education  Vision 2039 is not a construction plan  it is a leadership plan  However construction of new facilities and the renovations of older buildings on Post are essential components of Vision 2039 all the same  They provide a foundation for excellent programs  They encourage

cadets to meet the challenges of the 21st century are far more complex than they were in 1839  In fact  they are more complex than they were in 1989  when the Institute opened the newest academic building on Post  Vision 2039 aims to maintain the historic atmosphere of the Post as it develops the modern  technologically advanced facilities VMI needs to prepare cadets for lives of success  service  and leadership  The Corps will expand to 1 500 cadets with the addition of a new barracks  giving VMI the flexibility to fully modernize the existing structures  A new Leadership and Ethics

enhance cadet leadership development and the environment in which it takes place  The Institute s time tested  hands on environment develops leaders by combining education  experience  and training  Vision 2039 advances and enhances that environment  But there is much more to that environment than courses  training programs  and physical facilities  For leadership is more than a skill  It has moral and ethical dimensions  It is a question of character  The character of the individual cadet is directly influenced by the prevailing culture of the Institute  and Vision 2039 addresses this important aspect of VMI  The way cadets   men and women  live together and work together while at VMI lays the foundation for the way they will live and work throughout their lives  The culture of VMI

incorporates the improved and innovative academic programs supported by the Jackson Hope effort  MILITARY A structured military environment that places responsibilities on cadets and offers numerous leadership opportunities adds value to the VMI diploma  Vision 2039 reinforces the system of immersing young men and women in a military culture that includes the barracks  the parade ground  and four years of ROTC participation  That culture emphasizes teamwork  engenders civility and respect for others  develops commitment to service  and produces the selflessness and sense of honor that are the hallmarks of the citizen soldier  A key goal of Vision 2039 is to increase the percentage of graduates accepting commissions in the Armed Forces  whether active duty or reserve  Accepting a commission
