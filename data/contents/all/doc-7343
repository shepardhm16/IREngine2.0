24450 Institute Report  April 2009 By Wendy Lovell Coordinators of VMI s annual Undergraduate Research Symposium always hope for new and innovative projects  This year  they got their wish and more with the addition of the VMI Exhibition of the Arts  which was held on April 2 in conjunction with URS   Not only did this year s event showcase the scholarly work of our cadets but also the artistic talents of our faculty  staff and students  said Patricia Hardin  operations officer for the annual symposium   We were pleased with the response   about 40 pieces of art were on display and 12 artists took part in the afternoon performance  Traditionally URS has celebrated the intellectual accomplishments of cadets in the research arena  but this year  Lt  Col  Jay Sullivan  URS director  wanted the event to address the creative endeavors of the VMI community in the areas of art  music and literature  Two members of the faculty and staff and 10 cadets read their poetry  sang  and played the guitar  violin  and bagpipes during an afternoon concert and poetry reading  The artwork on display in Jackson Memorial Hall included sculpture  photography  paintings  drawings  and origami  Despite the addition of the arts exhibition  scholarly research was the main event of URS  with oral presentations taking place in classrooms across Post  as well as a poster session in the Center for Leadership and Ethics   More than 130 cadets representing all disciplines presented their work  and all oral presentations took part in the classroom  said Hardin   The poster session was held in the Center for Leadership and Ethics during the Environment Virginia conference  which gave those in attendance the chance to see the work our students are doing  too  Hardin added that the classroom venues worked well in providing a larger audience for the cadet presenters  Their peers asked good questions about the projects and benefited from exposure to the undergraduate research taking place across Post  Project topics ranged from the effect of caffeine on college students to wireless security and achieving diplomacy with Iran to energy usage and alternative heating systems  A variety of scientific  design  and engineering projects were presented  as well  URS projects were evaluated by judges  and the following cadets received cash prizes for their projects  Engineering
