Director of News and Editorial Services Virginia Military Institute Jan  15  2015 Feb 14  Elections Amid Unrest Download pdf Tombarge  The upcoming election Feb  14 in Nigeria pits a Christian incumbent with total control over patronage of centralized oil but no control   none   over the violence of Boko Haram against a Muslim former military dictator  So is perhaps the biggest challenger in a democratic election a former dictator  Why is Goodluck Jonathan perhaps favored to win in spite of all the violence  Just what on earth is going on   social  political dynamics  currents  Hentz  The reason why it may appear that Goodluck Jonathan has an early advantage would be that he has control over the patronage resources  he has control to some extent over the media and outflow of information  so he ll use his considerable resources to make it appear as if he s the likely winner  I probably would not bet on that being the actual fact  Gire  I think I would agree with that assessment  In fact  my first thought when you floated that idea was that I didn t know that he was expected or favored to be the winner  On the contrary  many would argue that unless the ruling government does something underhanded he stands very little chance of winning the election  But to address specifically the issue of the Christian south controlling resources versus the Muslim  I think Nigeria is more nuanced than many people think  Not that long ago  if you remember  Moshood  Kashimawo Olawale  Abiola was said to have won what at that time  1993  were deemed the most free and fair elections in Nigeria s history  What is often lost is that fact that both Abiola and  Baba Gana  Kingibe were Muslim  so a Muslim Muslim ticket won overwhelming votes in Nigeria  It was General  Ibrahim  Babangida who nullified the election  in fact  that perpetrated a crisis referred to as June 12 that ultimately would lead to the presidency of Olusegun Obasanjo because it was deemed that Abiola being from the southwest was deprived and therefore the southwest was owed the presidency  So when Obasanjo in 1999 was contesting the politicians from the north  the party deliberately did not contest for the nomination  It was actually handed to them  What many people don t realize is that sometimes the general Nigerian public yearns for military intervention in the face of just reckless corruption with impunity as is happening just right now  Security is usually a very important issue for any country  and there has been insecurity for years  And there is a general perception  and I will argue a reality  that the current government has been unable to address or to effectively handle the problem  The impression therefore is that being a strong military leader  perhaps that s the kind of person that will be needed at this particular point in time to tackle the insurgency  Hentz  When the United States was getting ready to allow Japan to elect its own leaders to free it from its  United States  control and we were doing this because we wanted Japan to be a voluntary ally against the Soviet Union and the discussion was  well  Japan isn t ready yet  they ll probably choose an authoritative leader  And the response in Washington was  they need stability probably more than they need a Jeffersonian democracy  We in the West tend to think they  you  can telescope political development and think that you can get everything at once  I agree with James 100 percent  He may have been a dictator  but if he s elected  he s no longer a dictator  he s an elected president first of all  and second of all the notion that he is a military man may resonate throughout the country and give them the stability that they need  I think it s frankly setting a bad precedent if Goodluck Jonathan does win  When he ascended to the presidency because the previous president died   I was in Nigeria at the time   and there were rumors of a coup d etat and instability because he was breaking the tradition of alternating northerners and southerners  and frankly it s probably a northerner s time to be the president  Gire  They call it the rotation of the presidency  When Jonathan insisted and got re elected  generally speaking including people like   President Obasanjo himself  say that he promised them that he was going to do just one additional term  So his now wanting to do another four years after doing six is viewed as breaking a promise  a solemn promise he had made  Who s Fighting Whom  Tombarge  Southern Nigeria  which is primarily responsible for Nigeria s status as Africa s biggest producer of oil  is far from the center of violence  Nigeria s Muslim north  and Boko Haram  whose leader  I don t dare try to say it  Gire  Abubakar Shekau Tombarge   There you go  has referenced the  glory days of northern Nigeria s medieval Muslim empires   Julia Payne  Reuters  Nigerians face killings  hunger in Boko Haram s  state  Jan  19  2015  He seems to be at war with Nigeria s Muslim center  So what s going on  Who s fighting who and where does this come from  Hentz  There is still conflict in the south  so let me go back to that first  The conflict in the Niger Delta is just lost in the headlines because of Boko Haram  So why  This doesn t really answer your question  but I think it s really important  The reason for that is because the narrative about war and conflict is dominated by the Western press  The western press is way more interested in Boko Haram because they re painting Boko Haram in the global war against terrorism narrative  So it fits right in to things we want to talk about and that we pay attention to  When the conflict in the Niger Delta heated up  it got nowhere near the amount of press that Boko Haram got  Now I will say that Boko Haram has certainly led to more fatalities and more extensive conflict than the Niger Delta  The conflict in the Niger Delta  though  is still a serious conflict  and it s still a serious problem  So what you really now have is two conflicts going on in Nigeria simultaneously  both   and this is from an academic perspective  what I like to look at   both in peripheral areas far from the center  the center being Lagos and Abuja  and in Nigerian politics  the periphery  whether it s the south or the north  have felt that they have not gotten their share of the cake  There are a lot of drivers to this conflict   I m sure between James and me we ll come up with a whole bunch   certainly one of the drivers is the equitable distribution of resources  and it is not equitable  and the further you get away from the capital and the center of the country the less likely you are to get in the proverbial Nigerian way of talking about it  a place at the table to eat  Gire  It is very true that there is still a lot of strife in the Niger Delta  The major difference here is that that particular conflict arises from people trying to essentially take control  they ve been ignored for so long  They believe that in the areas where the bulk of the oil was derived  and if you ve seen oil spills here   what BP was made to go through and so on   there ve been tons of spills across the oil producing areas Hentz  And gas flaring Gire  and gas flares  and it s an environmental disaster  And because of the complacency of the central government and so on  efforts to clean up and so on have not been adequate  leaving the people  some of whom are fishermen  unable to engage in very fulfilling day to day sustenance  And so the violence was to bring attention and say   Hey  we re here  and you ve got to take care of these issues that we ve been raving about  And to some extent that has succeeded because more resources have been diverted to that area of the country since the level of violence has escalated to try to stem that  With respect to Boko Haram in the north  it s a little bit different  That is  a  principally religious kind of thing  and that s why it s scary  and that s why everybody in Nigeria has to pay attention  Because Boko Haram s intentions are to Islamize the whole country  including what is currently popularly referred to as the Christian south  And so if everybody sits back and they keep making these military gains and so forth and eventually maybe if they were to capture the whole of the north  guess what their next target is going to be  So the quest is not going to end until they Islamize not just Nigeria but even the surrounding countries  As Jim can testify  right now the Boko Haram activities in Niger  in Chad  in Cameroon   these countries have had to use their armed forces at the borders of Nigeria  sometimes to chase back Boko Haram activities and so forth  They believe that a lot of what you might call regular Muslims are not really Islamic enough and therefore they are traitors  They are colluding with infidels to perpetrate a law that is not true to the Islamic law that they would want to oversee  In fact  in the early days of Boko Haram when they emerged in 2002  they were sometimes referred to as the Nigerian Taliban  And so their ideals are similar to creating a Nigerian society that will be based on the laws of Islam and have this purity running the country  so that s why other Muslims are not safe  if they re viewed as not pursuing the ideals of Islam or are colluding with infidels to perpetrate essentially a country that is not run based on pure moral values  Hentz  The conflict in the south indeed was triggered by very noble reasons  it was people in the south who were watching their livelihoods disappear  You can look at a time series study of the mango swamps in the Niger Delta and see the them shrink shrink shrink shrink shrink and the fisheries shrink and the oil companies getting rich and the big men getting richer and the people getting poorer  Within Nigeria  some of the poorest regions of the country are in the Niger Delta  although it provides 98 percent of the state s revenues  But the nature of the conflict in the Niger Delta has changed over time  While there still is what we call an element of reform insurgency   meaning   We want to reform the nature of the state    there s now side by side  maybe a better word would be integrated  with that a warlord conflict  what we call a war economy  And so there are insurgency groups   and there s an alphabet soup list of them   who actually make money off the conflict through  in particular  bunkering  where they steal the oil right out of the pipelines  Other insurgency groups actually act as protection for local governors  They pay these insurgency groups to protect the politicians  So there s many dimensions  There s another element to that conflict  The Boko Haram loosely translates as Western education is forbidden  The original founder to Boko Haram not only was promoting and propagating a more rigid form of Islam  but he was also saying that people with western education  which was mostly southerners  are dominating the government  And these southerners that dominate the government  which we knew was going to happen at independence because they were better educated  or Western educated  so not only is Boko Haram originally propagating Islam  it s also rejecting the education of the southern elite who they believe were dominating the government  which means they weren t getting the resources they believe they should have  It s not just moderate Muslim versus more radical Muslim  it s also northern Muslims versus the educated south who they thought were dominating the administration of the country  Gire  Many are of the view that the current wave of Boko Haram and other groups that are trying to resurge Islamic influence in Nigeria feel that at independence the predominantly Muslim north at the time had to give some because they were running Islamic law across a lot of those territories that became northern Nigeria  so they had to give some of that up in order to be integrated into the new country  At the same time  though  the person who was the premier of northern Nigeria  and one of the most influential politicians in Nigeria  Ahmadu Bello  is believed to have delayed Nigeria s independence by as much as five years because he did not believe that the north was ready  that if they had given independence at that time  the entire civil service structure would be run by southerners  So there s a vestige of that  What is interesting now is that some view the power situation in Nigerian not so much as just Christian Muslim per se  but as a few individuals who collude  who have economic interests that regardless of whether they are in the south or the north they collude to do whatever is necessary to grab power  So a lot of those people who are invoking religion are not very religious themselves  They are using that tool to get an advantage  I think at the bottom of it all is to  have  control of the powerful economic resources that are available  Hentz  There used to be an old saying about the Ireland conflict  that it was a political conflict masquerading as a religious conflict  in other words it was more about power than it was about religion  And when we talk about this conflict spreading into Chad  into Cameroon  into Niger  as it is  you have to understand that different actors join this conflict for different reasons  So it may be that at the heart of this conflict   I m talking about Boko Haram  it s an Islamic conflict   it s also about knitting together patrimonial networks across borders  And this is occurring by the way from Nigeria all the way through to Libya  these transnational criminal networks that are partnering with these transnational terrorist networks  These transnational criminal networks and terrorist networks are so intertwined now that it s almost impossible to untangle them  People join this insurgency for all kinds of reasons  James  it s not just religious  It could be as simple as if I give this guy a truckload of arms  I m going to get a bucket of diamonds in return  We call this again a war economy  And the scary thing to me about Boko Haram  more so than the Niger Delta  which has been a remarkably self contained conflict   it has not spread really  it s in the Niger Delta  it s spread a little bit in Nigeria  I m talking about across borders  Boko Haram has a different logic  The contagion effect there is much more severe  And I would argue because it s following the 400 year old trading routes in that part of the world  They re not doing anything different than what s been going on since the Sokoto Caliphate  They re just adapting what they want to do  their trading networks  their conflicts  to age old Trans Sahel trading routes and alliances  And it s a very fluid situation  Gire  In fact some people have used foreign fighters and labeled Boko Haram or whomever  even for conflicts within specific regions in Nigeria  You probably read this too  Jim  The Fulani cattle herders have had a lot of conflict with the farmers  Hentz  That s another dimension of the conflict  Gire  And a lot of that happened in central Nigeria  They essentially brought in fighters from as far afield as Libya involved in this  Because some of the folks captured could speak no known Nigerian language that anybody was aware of  It s something that s very fluid and dynamic such that depending on what your interests are you might use it for those specific interests  But there s also a broader  more comprehensive vision by Mohammed Yusuf  who was assassinated and succeeded by Abubakar Shekau  that s much broader  In fact  the original founder  this brand of Wahabi theology or philosophy  the guy was suspected to have been the intellectual founder  was born in 1927 or something  And he created this way of thinking that pure Islamic principles ought to be applied  And at some point before he died it was believed he was trying to actually set up the notion that he and not  the  prophet Mohammad was the true prophet that God had sent to spread his will  So it dates way back  Hentz  To add to what James said  I think what we re both painting is a picture of a regional conflict  not a Nigerian conflict  And recently the United States is sort of  I don t know if the word is celebrating  bragging  happy  that the Chadian army is willing to contribute to the fight against Boko Haram  So on the surface that sounds great just like getting rid of Kaddafi sounded great on the surface  The Chadian Army  though  is largely made up of Zaghawa who are Muslims  so now you re bringing in another group  of Zaghawa Muslims who are loyal to  Gen  Idriss  Deby in Chad to fight Boko Haram who are Muslims  which means that there could be a contagion effect in Darfur where the Zaghawa are also active  Again  from the U S  foreign policy perspective   something that I look at   we have a tendency to focus on one little piece of the puzzle and say this is the problem  We need open that aperture up and open it up and open it up and open it up until we understand the true nature of the playing field here  And it s not just northeast Nigeria  It s the trans Sahel  it s Nigeria  it s the south   it s history  I mean  as James was talking about  you need to go all the way back to the 1920s to understand how this Boko Haram evolved  Gire  That is a very apt analogy  Jim  In fact  in some ways you can draw parallels with what s going on with ISIL in Syria  Remember the Saudis and all these other folks who were tacitly supporting what is now ISIL because it was a Sunni group essentially going after Shiites and so forth  Which is why the Chadian situation is dangerous the way you characterize it  So in at some point this was nice because the Sunni group was subjugating Shiites  Guess what  It has now morphed out of control  And even the former sponsors are now feeling threatened because this stuff has ballooned beyond what the initial expectations were  So this has the potential to be really a wide scale problem if it s not contained   Training the Trainers  in Niger Tombarge  Jim  I know you just returned from Niger  Hentz  I did  I did  Tombarge  I was sort of interested in having you talk a little bit   weren t you working this problem over there from some angle  Hentz  I was  Well  indirectly  My trip to Niger was to what they call  train the trainers  So I was part of a three man team helping train the instructors at the Nigerian military academy  And the instructors whom I was with are on typically a two year rotation  They either have been to the front  which is Boko Haram  or they re going back to the front  Or the soldiers they re training are going back and forth from the front  Just days after I left Niger they had riots   I don t know if you re aware of this   literally days after I came back as a response to what France was doing and the cartoons and burnt down some churches and set some hotels on fire  I haven t found out if my hotel was set on fire  I don t know if I want to know if my hotel was set on fire  But Niger is a strong American ally right now  We re working very well with them  But the same substratum exists there as in northern Nigeria  These young men that are easily recruited into these sort of extremist movements because their lives just flat out are not very good and they see this as an option  maybe the only option  Niger s not doing that  they re not in there  but it s remarkable how I m there working as a representative of the United States government helping to promote U S  Nigerien relations and cooperation specifically in the fight against Islamic terrorism in the Trans Sahel and four days later there s riots in the capital because of their reaction to the political cartoons depicting the prophet in France  So it s a tinderbox  This part of the world is a tinderbox  Reflections on Life in Nigeria Tombarge  James  you also have spent a lot time actually in Nigeria and have just returned  so you ve been there very recently  Gire  Yes  Tombarge  And you ve spent a lot of time sort of working with developing higher education there  and I know you ve noted a real thirst for it  It s a rare commodity  although we were just talking about education in the south  So I guess I m wondering  there must be some people that go to work every day there  that try to live regular lives  and all of this is happening around them  So do you have things to say about what Nigeria s like now  Gire  You know the interesting thing is that the regular Nigerian is  I would imagine  one of the most optimistic persons out there  They have ambitions for education  for raising families  for having their children as well as themselves be successful  Even in the hotbed areas of Boko Haram  a lot of people are still going about their business and trying to make ends meet  which is why the forthcoming elections are viewed as being very important  Because it is believed that if the insecurity aspect is taken care of and then there is a reduction in corruption  particularly in the central government  then there is just this potential that will be unleashed out there  To give you an idea   many people view the current government as being   especially when it comes to corruption  A couple of examples will suffice  The president  upon responding to aspects of corruption will say some thing like this  Well people are so bent on talking about corruption that they sometimes will label common stealing as corruption  One time he says everything is labeled corruption in Nigeria when you build a very good house  you re viewed as being corrupt  which is surprising because if you re a regular civil servant maybe you earn like 50 000 naira a month  which is not that much  if you don t have any businesses out there or any other businesses out there or any other sources of income except your salary and so on  and all of a sudden you build a 60 million naira house  it has to be labeled as something  Where did you get the money from  And then in responding to why  along with India and China and so on  how there is general wealth but there is a lot of poverty in Nigeria  he said Nigeria is not poor because Nigeria is among the top 10 percent in the world in owning private jets  And that is precisely the problem  So people view this as well as the general insecurity as the basis to say we have what it takes  the elements are in place to have a viable  vibrant economy if only we get the right people at the helm to harness this  In their view  and this is the interesting thing   maybe going back to the first thing we discussed  which was  the  Muslim north and Christian south   there is for the first time probably since independence this is the first viable opposition has developed  Let me tell you why the north used to almost emerge as political leaders any time they had elections  In terms of population  it has more population than the south  But Nigeria has three major components  there s the north  there s the southwest and there s the southeast  The interesting thing is that even though both southwest and southeast were Christian  the predominantly Yoruba southwest and the predominantly Igbo southeast they were not always political partners  So the north would for the most part partner with the southeast and that gave the power    What has changed now the southwest  the second biggest political block to the north is now aligned with the north  Which is why my first comment was I didn t know the current president was favored because the political alliance between the southwest and the north right now is such a gigantic portion of the electorate that I m not sure where the president is going to get his votes from  People are hopeful and they know that Nigerians are some of the most hard working people  some of the most resourceful people out there  that the government has been in the way  And therefore if they could only bring in a government that is interested and going to work for the people  that their country is just going to go to good places  Hentz  The culture of corruption is persuasive  in Nigeria as it is in other countries  I think at some level  there s a level of  if not acceptance of corruption  almost the notion that this is something we have to live with  And I ll give you an interesting anecdotal story  I was traveling back from the Niger Delta to the airport  and we were listening to the Nigerian radio  And they were reporting on the revelation that the president of the Philippines had  100 000 hidden in a bank account   I think the number was  100 000  The two Nigerian announcers started laughing and said   100 000  One of our governors would be embarrassed if they only had  100 000 in their bank account  And it was just the way they joked about it and laughed about it that made you realize that this is something that they deal with on a daily basis and you wonder if they re accepting it  not because they think it s right but because accepting that it s a part of their daily life  With the regions  with the traditional three regions    within each of those regions you have ethnic minorities which are very important  When Nigeria was formed it had three states  Gire  Three regions  Hentz  Three regions  it now has 36 states  and the proliferation of states over time was essentially a way to create what we call in political science  prebends  Prebends are the riches that come with holding office  the more offices you create  the more governorships you create   and I m not even talking about localities   I forget  what are there 180 something local governments  Every government structure you create whether it s state or what they call locality is another opportunity to attach prebends  wealth  patronage attached to the office  So not only is there an issue of corruption  there is an issue of institutionalized corruption over the last 30 or 40 years  Gire  That s a very important point  Jim  and I think I ll be more than happy to elaborate  to give you some interesting dimension to that  Yes  corruption has been around forever  in fact almost every military takeover  corruption was one of the reasons cited for the military taking over  but here s what has happened  To some extent it has been accepted by Nigerians as a way of life and so on  but it s a matter of magnitude  To give you a sense  it used to be that people who  say you are in charge of awarding contracts and so one and somebody bids for it you might cut some deal with someone to get 10 percent and that was viewed as a horrible thing  And then 10 percent went to maybe like 20 and 30  What has happened right now  which almost no Nigerian finds acceptable    an example will be somebody who holds office has a business partner that he favors and awards a contract  maybe for a bridge  100 percent of the money for the bridge will be paid out and there will be no bridge  None  Certain rivers have had three or four bridges built across them that have never existed in reality  That s the current state  And even for Nigerians  that is too much  Which is why  Muhammadu  Buhari   is out there  Remember  a lot of the folks in the southwest are Christians  Buhari s running mate is an associate pastor of the Redeemed Church of Nigeria  OK  Buhari  when he went to Lagos a couple of months ago  laid out this challenge to Jonathan and every other Nigerian politician out there  He said   I was a military general and a head of state  I challenge anyone to bring to public any contracts that I may have given to myself or to anybody thought to be fronting for me  He said   I have no single foreign bank accounts  None  If you associate any bank account to my name that is not Nigerian  I beg you to bring it forth  He said   I have two houses  one in Kaduna and one in Fantora  I don t have a plot in Abuja  the Nigerian capital  I don t have a house in Abuja  He said   If you know of anything  bring it forth  No other Nigerian politician who has had opportunity   he was minister of petroleum  he was military president of Nigeria  he was the chair of the petroleum trust fund which was a fund created to use resources from petroleum for capital projects such as roads and big buildings and so forth  And he built roads  This is on record  Nigerians know this  So the only thing if you look at Jonathan s campaign the only thing is  Buhari cannot memorize his phone number  Buhari is not educated  Buhari is too old  He has not touched in terms of Buhari s integrity  Read the papers about the campaigns  about the issues that have been raised  People are just fed up  In other words  Nigerians are willing to tolerate corruption whereby  20 million have been allotted to build  say  a political science building at the university  you actually see it built  maybe it took  15 million to build it  people say   OK  maybe he ought to benefit a little bit from that  To some extent that has been accepted  What is not acceptable is the current impunity where nothing happens but yet 100 percent of the resources have been allotted  When we re talking about corruption  that s the magnitude that has been at work here  So Nigerians have lived with corruption but never with this level that is going on at this current time  Can Conflict in Nigeria Threaten the United States  Tombarge  OK  maybe one last question  Is Boko Haram and maybe more broadly the Nigerian unrest  is that a threat to the West  Hentz  That was asked on the Sunday talk shows  this Sunday  I usually watch a handful of them  Every single one asked  why the focus on ISIL  Boko Haram is killing as many people  They haven t done as well playing CNN  with you know  Jihad Joe  and the answer from the Washington insiders  these were  you know  joint chiefs of staff type people  is that no  we re keeping a close eye on north and west Africa  we do think it s a national security concern for the United States  Yes  the Middle East  ISIL are sort of taking front page news  And I can also tell you as somebody who does some consulting for the U S  there I was on the phone for an hour two days ago with somebody traveling to Niger and Mali and the borderline areas  setting up programs trying to drain what we call the swamp  which means creating programs for men and women to change the opportunity costs of joining the insurgency  make it so that this isn t the only option  So I think we re pretty well aware  ISIL s got  the  front page  France grabbed the front page  Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and Yemen s up there  but I think you re going to see over the next year that not just Boko Haram again but the whole Trans Sahel area is going to be a high priority for U S  national security  Gire  I absolutely agree that it is a problem  And   at this point would be a mistake because it s just like within Nigeria when it first started the central government ignored it and it was just some distraction and it just continued to grow to the point where it is now  What is interesting    with the situation in France  that  killed a few people  at that same time 2 000 people were killed in Nigeria  In fact even other African countries  that  sometimes refrain from criticizing Nigeria came down hard against Jonathan because he was one of the first leaders to send words of sympathy to France and had not mentioned a word about the 2 000 people that were killed in his own country  More than that  Boko Haram didn t start initially in terms of physical violence  it just progressed over time  The activities are becoming not only more explosive but more sophisticated  The general belief now is that they have training links with Al Qaeda  So if we re interested in Al Qaeda in Yemen  we ought to be interested in Boko Haram in Nigeria or other similar groups as well because eventually  there s going to be that link  Now what is happening  Jim being the scholarly expert in this area may bring his perspective as well  it is coming to a point where it is no longer block  big blocks groups like ISIL or Boko Haram  but the influence they have on young people  which is interesting mentioning draining the swamp  the folks who carried out the attacks on France and so on were not foreigners  they were French citizens  who had influence there  They come back with the passports of their own countries  they re not viewed as groups  but they re the most difficult to stop  And so it s in everyone s interest to recognize this for the serious problem that it is and ensure that it does not spread because otherwise it will splinter into these little fragments that are very difficult to contain from a broad national attack perspective  You can t take the U S  army against a few individuals who just returned from Syria  one of whom is in Kansas  one of whom is in Maine  another of whom is from a different part of the country  How are you going to use the forces as currently put together  Hentz  I would add a couple of things  Again  we are paying attention  I should have mentioned that the U S  military has an operation called Operation Flintlock  which is I think is in its third iteration if not  the  fourth  where the U S military holds an exercise in the Trans Sahel  which is a multinational exercise bringing the different armies together to cooperate  This year it s going to be held in Chad  I think just next month probably  Back to comparing it to ISIL or to Al Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula  all over the news right now is this notion that ISIL and AQAP are going to start trying to outbid each other for the more outstanding terrorist event   you can call this the CNN effect on steroids  right  If you want to get on the news  you have to be the one who does the most spectacular event  I don t know why they don t bring Boko Haram in here too  Shekau likes to be on TV  He likes publicity  and in fact  it s kind of we re back to James s 2 000  It s look at me  I just killed 2 000 people and you re not even looking at me  I m guessing  the amateur psychiatrist in me    pointing at Gire  he s the psychologist   says  he s going back saying  oh what do I have to do now  to get on TV  right  So all these different conflicts are linked  and then one last point  I think  not only do we have to take a regional approach  we have to take a holistic approach  We have to understand in a globalized world how events in France affect Niger  how events in Tunisia affect Libya  how events in Libya affect Nigeria  how events in Yemen affect Boko Haram  This is not just a regional challenge  this is a global challenge  from Minnesota to Paris to London to Nigeria  this is a global challenge so when you ignore one part of that challenge  you re making the entire challenge bigger  so you need to pay attention to Boko Haram or else the problem will get bigger  A Limit to How Much You Can Ignore Tombarge  OK  I guess we re going to wrap this up  Do either one of you have anything you want to add anything in thinking about the goings on in Nigeria  Gire  The most important thing in the foreseeable future  which is in about three weeks  is the forthcoming elections  which is interesting that you started with that  It has the potential to change  I think  maybe things for the better  In my view  not the individual in terms of   but the overall message  The central government has been in power since they started the PDP  the People s Democratic Party as we call it  in 1999 when the fourth republic was started  and   so a lot of the belief among the people is that so long as the same people get voted back  there is no incentive to actually address the real problems of the regular Nigerian  so a change at the center would be a signal that there s a limit to how much you can ignore  And so whichever government that comes in will be cognizant that the
