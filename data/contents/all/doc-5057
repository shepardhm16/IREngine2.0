Party General J  H  Binford Peay  III  Superintendent October 31  2014 Ladies and gentlemen  welcome to this evening s special gathering to celebrate the legacy of Coach John McKenna and the publication by Roland Lazenby and Mike Ashley of their book   Best Regrets  VMI s John McKenna and the Lost Age of College Football  which tells the story of Coach McKenna s 14 years at VMI  13 as head football coach  Coach McKenna s 62 wins are the most of any coach in VMI Keydet football history  We are especially pleased to welcome Roland Lazenby and Mike Ashley here tonight  Roland  as you may know  is a 1974 graduate of the Institute and a highly regarded sportswriter and educator  He has written more than a dozen nonfiction books  mainly about basketball and football  and has contributed articles to many magazines and newspapers   His book   Bull Run  The story of the 1995 96 Chicago Bulls  was named Sports Book of the Year for 1997 by the Independent Publishers Association and his recent books on the legends Jerry West and Michael Jordan are receiving nationally the best of reviews  He earned the MA degree from Hollins University and has served in Virginia Tech s Department of Communication and Radford University s School of Communication   Mike Ashley lives in the Washington D C  area and covers the University of Maryland athletic program and college sports for a variety of publications  Mike and Roland were immeasurably assisted in their research by Col  Mike Strickler  VMI Class 1971  who previously served as VMI Sports Information Director  later as VMI s Public Relations Officer  and Executive Officer to the Superintendent and Secretary to the Board of Visitors  After the text of the book was completed  finding a publisher was the next task  On behalf of the Institute  I thank the Keydet Club for assisting in financing this venture and assisting with this weekend  Athletics are integral to who we are and what we do at VMI  Certainly  this book confirms that vision  I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce to you Dr  David Diles  our Athletic Director  whom many of you may not have met  He graduated from Ohio University and holds a doctorate in education from the University of Michigan  Before coming to VMI in October of 2013  he was the Director of Athletics and Professor and Chair of the Department of Physical Education  Recreation  and Athletics at NCAA Division II member Case Western Reserve University  Before that  he was the Athletic Director at two Division I schools   St  Bonaventure and Eastern Michigan And  how great it is this evening to have the McKenna children here  Kathleen  Mary  Margaret  and Stephen  VMI thanks all of you for coming back this weekend  The idea for Lazenby s and Ashley s book came from two of Coach McKenna s former players  both from the Class of 1960 and both retired U S  Air Force Officers  Tom Daniel and Howard Moss  It has been in the making since 2006  It is ironic that it   Best Regrets  is being published in the year of VMI s return to the Southern Conference  the league in which Coach McKenna and his Keydet teams had so much success  When we determined to return to the Southern Conference  effective 1 July of this year  VMI made a commitment to position the Institute with the ability to  stand tall  in that conference  We started the journey several years ago  focusing particularly on securing the private endowment support needed to advance the Institute s mission  while continuing to massively enhance our facilities for the Corps and our NCAA athletes  I think Coach McKenna would be pleased with our return to the Southern Conference  as we were among its early members  Coach McKenna led our teams to four Southern Conference Championships  six Virginia State Championships  six consecutive winning seasons  and an undefeated season in 1957  when at one point  the  57 Team was ranked 13th in the nation  In the  Golden Years  of 1957 to 1962  VMI won 42 and lost 13   He was three times Southern Conference Coach of the Year  in 1957  1959  and 1962   the only coach so honored to that time   and was Chairman of the Southern Conference Football Committee from 1957 to 1960  His tenure at VMI was a time of the true student athlete  Perhaps one platoon football contributed to that as players competed both ways and had to be capable across the spectrum  Coach McKenna demanded performance academically  militarily  and ethically  as well as on the gridiron  In October of 2005  two years before he died  we were privileged  and many of you were here  to welcome Coach McKenna back to VMI for a reunion dinner and to dedicate a plaque to his honor  We wish he were with us tonight to receive the accolades  again  that he so richly deserves  and to receive this testament to his skill  leadership  and commitment to the development of those who played for him  Now it is my pleasure to welcome Roland Lazenby to speak briefly to you this evening  I hope you will enjoy this gathering tonight  the parade in the morning  the Keydet Club luncheon and the  victory  over Furman on Alumni Field  Thanks for returning to the

Ladies and gentlemen  welcome to this evening s special gathering to celebrate the legacy of Coach John McKenna and the publication by Roland Lazenby and Mike Ashley of their book   Best Regrets  VMI s John McKenna and the Lost Age of College Football  which tells the story of Coach McKenna s 14 years at VMI  13 as head football coach  Coach McKenna s 62 wins are the most of any coach in VMI Keydet football history  We are especially pleased to welcome Roland Lazenby and Mike Ashley here tonight  Roland  as you may know  is a 1974 graduate of the Institute and a highly regarded sportswriter and educator  He has written more than a dozen nonfiction books  mainly about basketball and football  and has contributed articles to many magazines and newspapers   His book   Bull Run  The story of the 1995 96 Chicago Bulls  was named Sports Book of the Year for 1997 by the Independent Publishers Association and his recent books on the legends Jerry West and Michael Jordan are receiving nationally the best of reviews  He earned the MA degree from Hollins University and has served in Virginia Tech s Department of Communication and Radford University s School of Communication   Mike Ashley lives in the Washington D C  area and covers the University of Maryland athletic program and college sports for a variety of publications  Mike and Roland were immeasurably assisted in their research by Col  Mike Strickler  VMI Class 1971  who previously served as VMI Sports Information Director  later as VMI s Public Relations Officer  and Executive Officer to the Superintendent and Secretary to the Board of Visitors  After the text of the book was completed  finding a publisher was the next task  On behalf of the Institute  I thank the Keydet Club for assisting in financing this venture and assisting with this weekend  Athletics are integral to who we are and what we do at VMI  Certainly  this book confirms that vision  I would also like to take this opportunity to introduce to you Dr  David Diles  our Athletic Director  whom many of you may not have met  He graduated from Ohio University and holds a doctorate in education from the University of Michigan  Before coming to VMI in October of 2013  he was the Director of Athletics and Professor and Chair of the Department of Physical Education  Recreation  and Athletics at NCAA Division II member Case Western Reserve University  Before that  he was the Athletic Director at two Division I schools   St  Bonaventure and Eastern Michigan And  how great it is this evening to have the McKenna children here  Kathleen  Mary  Margaret  and Stephen  VMI thanks all of you for coming back this weekend  The idea for Lazenby s and Ashley s book came from two of Coach McKenna s former players  both from the Class of 1960 and both retired U S  Air Force Officers  Tom Daniel and Howard Moss  It has been in the making since 2006  It is ironic that it   Best Regrets  is being published in the year of VMI s return to the Southern Conference  the league in which Coach McKenna and his Keydet teams had so much success  When we determined to return to the Southern Conference  effective 1 July of this year  VMI made a commitment to position the Institute with the ability to  stand tall  in that conference  We started the journey several years ago  focusing particularly on securing the private endowment support needed to advance the Institute s mission  while continuing to massively enhance our facilities for the Corps and our NCAA athletes  I think Coach McKenna would be pleased with our return to the Southern Conference  as we were among its early members  Coach McKenna led our teams to four Southern Conference Championships  six Virginia State Championships  six consecutive winning seasons  and an undefeated season in 1957  when at one point  the  57 Team was ranked 13th in the nation  In the  Golden Years  of 1957 to 1962  VMI won 42 and lost 13   He was three times Southern Conference Coach of the Year  in 1957  1959  and 1962   the only coach so honored to that time   and was Chairman of the Southern Conference Football Committee from 1957 to 1960  His tenure at VMI was a time of the true student athlete  Perhaps one platoon football contributed to that as players competed both ways and had to be capable across the spectrum  Coach McKenna demanded performance academically  militarily  and ethically  as well as on the gridiron  In October of 2005  two years before he died  we were privileged  and many of you were here  to welcome Coach McKenna back to VMI for a reunion dinner and to dedicate a plaque to his honor  We wish he were with us tonight to receive the accolades  again  that he so richly deserves  and to receive this testament to his skill  leadership  and commitment to the development of those who played for him  Now it is my pleasure to welcome Roland Lazenby to speak briefly to you this evening  I hope you will enjoy this gathering tonight  the parade in the morning  the Keydet Club luncheon and the  victory  over Furman on Alumni Field  Thanks for returning to the Institu Administration Home Superintendent Home General Peay s Bio Vision
