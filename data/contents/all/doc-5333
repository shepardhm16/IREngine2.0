Annotated Bibliography Robert T  Kerlin s Works Annotated Bibliography Return to Kerlin top level Research by Cadet Fredrick Walker  VMI Class of 2015 Kerlin  Robert T  The Camp Life of the Third Regiment  Kansas City  MO  Hudson  Kimberly Pub  1898  Print  This book is almost entirely comprised of letters written by soldiers in the camp of the Third Missouri Volunteers during the Mexican American War  All  but two of the chapters in this book are unedited personal letters  In this text  Kerlin  an Army chaplain serving with the unit  attempts to explain what camp life was like from the point of view of someone who has  seen it all  Kerlin opens this text with the Preface describing its contents  Immediately following the Preface is the Valedictory in which Kerlin remembers the regiment s fallen historian and himself bids farewell to the soldiers that he has camped with  This book would be useful for someone researching the camp life of soldiers during the era of the Mexican American War  It would also be helpful to those studying the history of the United States Army National Guard or the United States military as a whole  A writer could easily compare the issues discussed by soldiers from the late 19th century with those contemplated by soldiers in both the 20th and 21st century US military  Kerlin  Robert T  Negro Poets and Their Poems  Washington  D C  Associated  1923  Print  In this text  Kerlin provides a brief history of the development of the African American cultural identity through various forms of poetry by a variety of authors  Each of the eight chapters is centered on a particular aspect of poetry  For example  the first chapter discusses the history and development of African American songs  to include the spiritual and the secular  Latter chapters include discussion on the works of various poets such as J  Mord Allen  W E B  DuBois  and Roscoe C  Jamison  This writing would be helpful for those researching the life of Dr  Robert T  Kerlin or even the history of African American slave songs  This would also be a fine choice for researching African American poets and their part in the history of the United States  This book might also be used to expose the fan of poetry to the texts and titles of some poems that they may not have previously known of or read  Kerlin  Robert T  The Voice of the Negro  1919  New York  Arno and the New York Times  1968  Print  In the words of Kerlin   Virtually the entire Afro American press  consisting of two dailies  a dozen magazines  and nearly three hundred weeklies  is drawn upon in this text  He seeks to present not only the voice of the Negro  but also the heart and mind of the African American community as well  This text is composed mostly of newspaper and magazine articles that seek to answer the American race question  This text is divided into ten sections organized by topic  such as  The Colored Press   The Negro s Reaction to the World War  and  Riots  which include brief introductions  This compilation would be extremely beneficial to any researcher who is studying the African American population s view on race both in the past and in the present  Because it was written in the months that followed the Washington DC Race Riot of 1919  it would be a wonderful resource for anyone researching that event  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
