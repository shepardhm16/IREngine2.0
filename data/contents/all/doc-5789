Economics and Business  at moreschilp vmi edu or  540  464 7237 Cadet Internships At least ten Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2012  Good internships are hard to find these days due to the current state of the economy  Cadets have to think outside of the box and use every connection they can think of to locate an internship  We emphasize networking  especially within the VMI alumni community  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities arranged by the Alumni Association and Career Services  and to also have alumni who are willing to mentor them through their job search process  All of these efforts have paid off this year  and we have an impressive list of companies who will have cadet interns this summer JP Morgan Chase Owens   Minor GE Aviation WB A Market Research Virginia Asset Management The London Company Sherwin Williams Richmond Kickers Soccer Club Omaha Storm Chasers AAA Baseball team

these cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for these cadets who are often earning top salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Linda Moreschi  Internship
