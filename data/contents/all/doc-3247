experience  VMI offers a number of exciting enrichment programs that enhance the primary academic experiences provided in its majors and minors  demonstrating the Institute s full commitment to educating the whole cadet  The Jackson Hope Fund Board has echoed its support of these initiatives by supporting cadets who conduct research and participate in academic competitions and by funding state of the art equipment in chemistry and biology  One of the hallmarks of VMI s academic program is the Undergraduate Research Initiative  URI  which provides the stage on which cadets can compete and be nationally recognized for their research  analysis  inventions and presentation standards  The efforts of URI were greatly enhanced in 2001 when it received one of the first Jackson Hope Fund grants to establish the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  SURI  The program has grown each year  and 35 proposals were funded during the summer of 2009  including a research project conducted by Maj  Ryan Taylor  assistant professor of mechanical engineering  and Cadet Travis Travis   The SURI experience   deciding on a research topic  submitting a proposal  designing and building the experiment and writing the research paper to describe my findings and conclusions   has developed my skills as a professional researcher in a way that no other program at VMI can  said Travis   I now feel confident that I would be able to undertake a project in a professional environment  such as industry  and see it through to a successful  and more importantly  accurate conclusion  My knowledge of the subject of interest in my research project  computer overclocking and thermal management  has also grown by leaps and bounds and the outcome of this project could shed a very useful light on a dark and little understood subject  To maximize the amount of financial support available to VMI s academic program  in 2003 the Board of the Jackson Hope Fund authorized funding for VMI s first grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator who is tasked with assisting Institute members in obtaining extramural funding and in matters related to intellectual property   Having someone who can reduce the administrative burden that comes with submitting most extramural proposals is something new to VMI  said Cmdr  Mike Sebastino  Assistant Dean for Academic Administration and Planning  who held the position initially   The paperwork and red tape can certainly be a deterrent to faculty in responding to funding solicitations  and that s a shame  because there are a lot of people at VMI doing high quality work that would be very competitive  With the addition of a grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator  VMI has noticed a steady increase in the amount of interest in extramural funding opportunities both in the humanities and in the sciences and engineering  This staff member has been invaluable in assisting faculty members in submitting proposals in support of a wide variety of activities  such as the implementation of new teaching methods and courses  undergraduate research centers  and academic conferences and scientific research  As a result  the average amount  of extramural funding expended in support of research and education projects annually has increased from about  98 000 in 2003 to more than  800 000 in 2009  Another program established with the support of the Jackson Hope Fund is VMI s Science   Security minor  which integrates the study of science  social science and engineering themes to produce graduates prepared for careers in national and homeland security  including positions in government agencies such as the FBI  the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security  private research and public policy institutes  and in the legislative branch as congressional aides and on committee and sub committee staffs  A particular strength of the program is its summer academic and internship program in Washington  D C   Each cadet admitted to the program must work in a full time internship in the national security community broadly defined with a mentor to deliver a professional deliverable that is integrated into a capstone research project at VMI in the senior class year  said Col  R E  Burnett  professor of international studies and director of the Science   Security minor   Cadets also must complete an academic course in intelligence analysis and production with VMI professors  also in Washington  D C  that culminates in a  National Intelligence Estimate  simulation that is presented to intelligence community professionals for evaluation and critique  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents

academic experiences provided in its majors and minors  demonstrating the Institute s full commitment to educating the whole cadet  The Jackson Hope Fund Board has echoed its support of these initiatives by supporting cadets who conduct research and participate in academic competitions and by funding state of the art equipment in chemistry and biology  One of the hallmarks of VMI s academic program is the Undergraduate Research Initiative  URI  which provides the stage on which cadets can compete and be nationally recognized for their research  analysis  inventions and presentation standards  The efforts of URI were greatly enhanced in 2001 when it received one of the first Jackson Hope Fund grants to establish the Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  SURI  The program has grown each year  and 35 proposals were funded during the summer of 2009  including a research project conducted by Maj  Ryan Taylor  assistant professor of mechanical engineering  and Cadet Travis Travis   The SURI experience   deciding on a research topic  submitting a proposal  designing and building the experiment and writing the research paper to describe my findings and conclusions   has developed my skills as a professional researcher in a way that no other program at VMI can  said Travis   I now feel confident that I would be able to undertake a project in a professional environment  such as industry  and see it through to a successful  and more importantly  accurate conclusion  My knowledge of the subject of interest in my research project  computer overclocking and thermal management  has also grown by leaps and bounds and the outcome of this project could shed a very useful light on a dark and little understood subject  To maximize the amount of financial support available to VMI s academic program  in 2003 the Board of the Jackson Hope Fund authorized funding for VMI s first grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator who is tasked with assisting Institute members in obtaining extramural funding and in matters related to intellectual property   Having someone who can reduce the administrative burden that comes with submitting most extramural proposals is something new to VMI  said Cmdr  Mike Sebastino  Assistant Dean for Academic Administration and Planning  who held the position initially   The paperwork and red tape can certainly be a deterrent to faculty in responding to funding solicitations  and that s a shame  because there are a lot of people at VMI doing high quality work that would be very competitive  With the addition of a grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator  VMI has noticed a steady increase in the amount of interest in extramural funding opportunities both in the humanities and in the sciences and engineering  This staff member has been invaluable in assisting faculty members in submitting proposals in support of a wide variety of activities  such as the implementation of new teaching methods and courses  undergraduate research centers  and academic conferences and scientific research  As a result  the average amount  of extramural funding expended in support of research and education projects annually has increased from about  98 000 in 2003 to more than  800 000 in 2009  Another program established with the support of the Jackson Hope Fund is VMI s Science   Security minor  which integrates the study of science  social science and engineering themes to produce graduates prepared for careers in national and homeland security  including positions in government agencies such as the FBI  the CIA and the Department of Homeland Security  private research and public policy institutes  and in the legislative branch as congressional aides and on committee and sub committee staffs  A particular strength of the program is its summer academic and internship program in Washington  D C   Each cadet admitted to the program must work in a full time internship in the national security community broadly defined with a mentor to deliver a professional deliverable that is integrated into a capstone research project at VMI in the senior class year  said Col  R E  Burnett  professor of international studies and director of the Science   Security minor   Cadets also must complete an academic course in intelligence analysis and production with VMI professors  also in Washington  D C  that culminates in a  National Intelligence Estimate  simulation that is presented to intelligence community professionals for evaluation and critique Academics Home Jackson Hope Fund Video Testimonies Jackson Hope Stories Initiatives Faculty Development Faculty Positions Academic Programs Accreditation Academic Experience Funding Process
