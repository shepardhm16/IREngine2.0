one of only three full time faculty members who  along with one adjunct  taught an offering of courses that was minimal at best  International studies went independent in 1997  and since then  the number of faculty has tripled  and the department houses an Institute Chair  The department now offers 54 different classes and has become the largest on post  The popularity of the major is a given  particularly at a military school  where about half of the students will accept a military commission   that number is about 65 70 percent for international studies majors   and  Hentz said  want to learn  about the parts of the world where they are going to put boots on the ground someday   What this department does really well  what makes us a little different from other programs  is we do focus on international politics  said Hentz  In addition to traditional political science courses  the department offers classes dealing with the politics of individual countries around the world and has added courses dealing with what Hentz called  subsequent issue areas that aren t confined to geographic areas  classes like IS 329  Counterinsurgency  and IS 344  Multinational Peacekeeping  Most recently  the department added a whole new geographic area in classes taught by its newest faculty member  assistant professor Dr  Vera Heuer  Last spring  she taught a class about the Indian sub continent dealing with issues in India  Pakistan  Bangladesh  and Sri Lanka  This semester  she is teaching a course dealing with riots  protests  and social movements around the world   Some of these  topics  have huge implications internationally  Heuer said   Even if they  the cadets  don t join the military  she added   a lot of them have aspirations to join intelligence or other similar career paths  It s faculty like Heuer and Hentz that keep VMI s international studies department ahead of similar programs around the country  They love research  a must in the international studies field  They are published and attend conferences often  Most importantly  perhaps  they have all traveled extensively  spending a great deal of time in their countries of expertise   It s not that we re
