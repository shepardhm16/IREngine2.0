the goals of Vision 2039 is the improvement of VMI s academic reputation to establish the Institute as a premier undergraduate college in America  The ability to attract and retain the most outstanding faculty is a critical element in achieving this goal  Thanks to support from the Jackson Hope Fund Virginia Military Institute has been able to attract and retain more than 15 junior and senior faculty members with signing bonuses and funding to establish the laboratories and research programs they need to be successful in their professions  The Jackson Hope Fund has provided new faculty positions in mathematics and computer science molecular biology and materials chemistry  as well as two new positions in VMI s most populous engineering major mechanical engineering  The humanities and social sciences have gained 11 new positions  four in psychology and leadership  two in economics and business  three in international studies and one each in Arabic and rhetoric and composition   The Jackson Hope Fund has been a tremendous boost to the academic program at VMI in general  but especially to the Department of Psychology and Philosophy  said department head Col  James Gire   It provided us a much needed lifeline at a critical time  generously supporting four positions in the department  three of which are leadership faculty  which enables us to implement a core curriculum course in organizational leadership  Not only does this course support leadership development  a major focus of Vision 2039  but it also serves as the gateway requirement for the academic minor in leadership studies  Maj  Glenn Sullivan came to VMI in 2006 thanks to Jackson Hope funding and has made an indelible mark on the Institute with outstanding teaching and a dedication to mentoring cadets  Already a well recognized researcher in forensic psychology  Sullivan has made the boundary between teaching and research transparent by fully engaging cadet researchers in his own groundbreaking work  It s this passion and enthusiasm for his profession as an educator that explains why students are drawn to him like a magnet and why his peers awarded him the 2009 Thomas Jefferson Teaching Award  presented once each year to a faculty member who demonstrates qualities that inspire the development of traits of intellect and character in cadets  Sullivan also has been an enthusiastic contributor to VMI s Summer Undergraduate Research Initiative  SURI  supervising five cadets  independent research projects  three of which have been presented at external venues  including one national conference  Two of these studies empirically tested a prominent model of psychopathology  the first studies of their kind to do so  A third study revisited the classic  Milgram study  on obedience  focusing on the personality dispositions of those who heroically refused to inflict harm on another person  Like Sullivan Mohamed Taifi came to VMI thanks to Jackson Hope funding and has helped develop the Arabic program into one of the largest language programs at the Institute  Through a summer research and language immersion program in Morocco  Taifi has introduced hundreds of cadets to a new world and has helped prepare them for careers in government  business and the military  The recent growth and the strength of VMI s Arabic program attracted the attention of the U S  Department of Defense  which awarded VMI a three year grant in 2008 to enhance its program and provide opportunities for ROTC cadets to study the language and culture abroad  VMI Foundation Keydet

ability to attract and retain the most outstanding faculty is a critical element in achieving this goal  Thanks to support from the Jackson Hope Fund Virginia Military Institute has been able to attract and retain more than 15 junior and senior faculty members with signing bonuses and funding to establish the laboratories and research programs they need to be successful in their professions  The Jackson Hope Fund has provided new faculty positions in mathematics and computer science molecular biology and materials chemistry  as well as two new positions in VMI s most populous engineering major mechanical engineering  The humanities and social sciences have gained 11 new positions  four in psychology and leadership  two in economics and business  three in international studies and one each in Arabic and rhetoric and composition   The Jackson Hope Fund has been a tremendous boost to the academic program at VMI in general  but especially to the Department of Psychology and Philosophy  said department head Col  James Gire   It provided us a much needed lifeline at a critical time  generously supporting four positions in the department  three of which are leadership faculty  which enables us to implement a core curriculum course in organizational leadership  Not only does this course support leadership development  a major focus of Vision 2039  but it also serves as the gateway requirement for the academic minor in leadership studies  Maj  Glenn Sullivan came to VMI in 2006 thanks to Jackson Hope funding and has made an indelible mark on the Institute with outstanding teaching and a dedication to mentoring cadets  Already a well recognized researcher in forensic psychology  Sullivan has made the boundary between teaching and research transparent by fully engaging cadet researchers in his own groundbreaking work  It s this passion and enthusiasm for his profession as an educator that explains why students are drawn to him like a magnet and why his peers awarded him the 2009 Thomas Jefferson Teaching Award  presented once each year to a faculty member who demonstrates qualities that inspire the development of traits of intellect and character in cadets  Sullivan also has been an enthusiastic contributor to VMI s Summer Undergraduate Research Initiative  SURI  supervising five cadets  independent research projects  three of which have been presented at external venues  including one national conference  Two of these studies empirically tested a prominent model of psychopathology  the first studies of their kind to do so  A third study revisited the classic  Milgram study  on obedience  focusing on the personality dispositions of those who heroically refused to inflict harm on another person  Like Sullivan Mohamed Taifi came to VMI thanks to Jackson Hope funding and has helped develop the Arabic program into one of the largest language programs at the Institute  Through a summer research and language immersion program in Morocco  Taifi has introduced hundreds of cadets to a new world and has helped prepare them for careers in government  business and the military  The recent growth and the strength of VMI s Arabic program attracted the attention of the U S  Department of Defense  which awarded VMI a three year grant in 2008 to enhance its program and provide opportunities for ROTC cadets to study the language and culture abroad
