of Virginia  Richmond General  Your letter of the 22d inst  enclosing that of General Francis H  Smith in which he proposes to tender the services of the Corps of Cadets at the Virginia Military Institute for the approaching campaign is received  I desire to express my appreciation of the patriotic spirit that actuates Genl  Smith in making this proposal  and my gratification at finding that it meets with your concurrence  I do not think however that it would be best at this time for the Corps to be called to this Army  It is now in a situation to render valuable aid in defending our western frontier which may be menaced simultaneously with the general advance of the enemy in the east  It will thus prevent the necessity of detaching troops from this army  I think it would be advisable for Genl  Smith to hold the command in readiness to cooperate with Genl  Breckinridge   Genl Imboden in case of necessity   to notify those officers of the fact  Should it at any time become necessary or expedient to have the services of the cadets with this army  it is very gratifying to me to know that they are so freely placed at my disposal  Very Resp  Yr  Obt  Servt signed R E  Lee
