providing financial oversight to the organization  whose work helps prevent the spread of HIV AIDS in Uganda  Burundi  and Tanzania  and is also active in Dernovsek s home state of Colorado  After graduating from VMI  Dernovsek spent 2  years with the Peace Corps in Lesotho  Africa  educating people about HIV AIDS and initiating projects to improve the standard of living  Often he spoke to groups of people and organized projects using the country s native language  which he learned on site  Now  four years after his return  he knows that in a small country in Africa  thanks to his

LEXINGTON  Va  July 14  2008  Andrew Dernovsek  06 gets around these days mostly on foot and on his stallion  Leluma  In the mountainous terrain of the African enclave Lesotho  villages can be 30 unpaved kilometers apart and many are perched on the tops of mountains  But every so often he goes worldwide with his Internet journal  For Dernosvek  logging on means riding in   40 minutes on horseback from the middle of nowhere  that is  That WiFi hotspot in the wilderness   at a Partners in Health clinic   allowed him to answer questions for this article  and  if he climbs the right mountain  he can even use his cell phone to talk to his family  It s a good thing he learned at VMI to face the unexpected with a cool head and a firm hand  because as HIV AIDS adviser to the Lesotho Catholic Bishops Conference  Dernovsek has found life to be a study in contrasts  Among these are the demographics of the region  With an entire generation wiped out by disease  the population is made up of the old and the young   I often work with old women and old men  I often teach their grandchildren  but rarely do I run into people my own age  said Dernovsek   The demographic simply isn t there  Tasked with helping people suffering from HIV AIDS and educating communities in prevention of the disease in a place where the rate of infection may be as high as 31 percent and life expectancy as low as age 37  Dernovsek has found that there is much to do  His primary project is to travel to villages to speak to groups advising prevention of HIV AIDS through abstinence from sexual activity until marriage and faithfulness afterward  He also visits those sick with and dying of HIV AIDS in the villages   The area has been gutted of its work force  and every weekend I am reminded of the presence of death in the form of funerals  said Dernovsek   They are inescapable  as is the sorrow of this country  and they have become a way of life  Though Dernovsek often speaks directly to villagers  he also works to organize and educate groups of local people so they can reach out still further with vital information  But the kind of behavioral change that will make a difference in Lesotho is hard to teach   Infidelity is something that is ingrained in the culture here  said Dernovsek  He said he could not understand why it is acceptable for married people to have partners in addition to their spouses   Infidelity happens regularly and without moral reserve  When he is not visiting villages  Dernovsek teaches English  and sometimes math and science as well  at a village school  He also takes up other projects for which he must himself raise funds while in country  His pig breeding project  for instance  is well under way  He has completed fund raising  using a blog to reach the outside world  and has pigs on site  He will use them to teach the villagers how to raise and breed healthy animals  Dernovsek hopes to extend the project to teach the villagers how to preserve meat to achieve a more uniformly healthy diet than they currently have  Dernovsek is trying to fund and launch two other projects this summer  The Ketane Water Project will bring clean water to what Dernovsek calls  the most remote drought stricken areas of Lesotho  The Nohana Computer School will bring sustainable and widespread development  he said  Information on both is posted periodically in his blog  While Dernovsek s goals for the people of Lesotho are ambitious  his personal achievements there are no less so  Although there are a few situations in which he may use English and be understood  almost all of his communication with the local people  from lectures on healthy living to directions for growing a diversified vegetable garden  must be carried out in the Sesotho language  He surprised himself recently when asked to give an impromptu talk to a large community gathering   Without skipping a beat  I was able to put together a whole speech on the go  As I was speaking  I noticed that I could adapt what I was saying based on the reactions of the people  An international studies major at VMI  Dernovsek has learned practical skills in the Peace Corps   I have learned to ride a horse  to farm dozens of varieties of vegetables  plumbing  electrical wiring  construction and many other things  he said   Basically  if I want to get something here  I have to do it myself  I wired my own solar panel  given to him for his computer school by the Bishops Conference  and rigged it to charge my laptop  Dernovsek says he developed  nerves of steel  at VMI   On a daily basis I run into situations that would test most nerves and tempers and push them to the limit  What do you do when you ve been driving in a taxi with 20 people that only seats 14 for the last six hours  your tire blows and you arrive at home in the middle of the night to find your dog missing and garden dying   The stress I face here is nothing compared to the stress that I not only learned to live with  but also to work productively with at VMI  VMI gave me the ability to balance all aspects of my life  including my tasks   People often ask me how I am able to keep so many projects going and focus on so many different things at once  The answer is simple  I prioritize and balance the different parts of my life and of my projects to meet the needs of the situation  I am confident that nowhere is this better ingrained into a person than in an environment like that of VMI  Dernovsek must carry these stresses with a special grace  as the people of Ketane have given him a special name in Sesotho  It draws on an older name for the area  Nohana  Thabo Nohana  his Sesotho name  means Joy of Nohana   The people told me that I brought joy to them with my presence  and they knew I would continue to bring joy in the future  he explained  He also brings with him a taste of what it means to be an American answering a president s call for service   I serve as an ambassador for the American people  he said   VMI makes citizen soldiers    If there were a draft or a national call for soldiers tomorrow  would I heed it  Unflinchingly   Until then  I am still serving my country    I am the only American that the vast majority of people in my area will ever meet  I serve to show them what an American really is    Share this entry Share on Facebook Share on

All Aspects of Life August 30  2013 in Alumni  Stories  by Kate Andrew Dernovsek  06 is executive director of Universal Chastity Education  a non profit organization that promotes  through Christian principles  abstinence and faithful marriage as the healthiest way of life  On any given day  Dernovsek might find himself speaking to students  raising money  and providing financial oversight to the organization  whose work helps prevent the spread of HIV AIDS in Uganda  Burundi  and Tanzania  and is also active in Dernovsek s home state of Colorado  After graduating from VMI  Dernovsek spent 2  years with the Peace Corps in Lesotho  Africa  educating people about HIV AIDS and initiating projects to improve the standard of living  Often he spoke to groups of people and organized projects using the country s native language  which he learned on site  Now  four years after his return  he knows that in a small country in Africa  thanks to his efforts  a computer school is fully solar powered and has over 100 laptops  a Widows project has a solar oven bakery  and a community has a library and a school garden  After his time in Lesotho  Dernovsek returned to the United States and took up his duties with UCE while earning a master of arts degree in international administration and a certificate in finance from the University of Denver   VMI  says Dernovsek   prepared me as a leader and gave me the tools I needed to succeed at whatever I do  At VMI  I learned patience  flexibility  discipline  and above all integrity  He adds   On some tough days  I think back to VMI  and I m just thankful that I m not caught on the third stoop during a free period doing push ups until my arms fall off  Read about Dernovsek s time in Lesotho LEXINGTON  Va  July 14  2008  Andrew Dernovsek  06 gets around these days mostly on foot and on his stallion  Leluma  In the mountainous terrain of the African enclave Lesotho  villages can be 30 unpaved kilometers apart and many are perched on the tops of mountains  But every so often he goes worldwide with his Internet journal  For Dernosvek  logging on means riding in   40 minutes on horseback from the middle of nowhere  that is  That WiFi hotspot in the wilderness   at a Partners in Health clinic   allowed him to answer questions for this article  and  if he climbs the right mountain  he can even use his cell phone to talk to his family  It s a good thing he learned at VMI to face the unexpected with a cool head and a firm hand  because as HIV AIDS adviser to the Lesotho Catholic Bishops Conference  Dernovsek has found life to be a study in contrasts  Among these are the demographics of the region  With an entire generation wiped out by disease  the population is made up of the old and the young   I often work with old women and old men  I often teach their grandchildren  but rarely do I run into people my own age  said Dernovsek   The demographic simply isn t there  Tasked with helping people suffering from HIV AIDS and educating communities in prevention of the disease in a place where the rate of infection may be as high as 31 percent and life expectancy as low as age 37  Dernovsek has found that there is much to do  His primary project is to travel to villages to speak to groups advising prevention of HIV AIDS through abstinence from sexual activity until marriage and faithfulness afterward  He also visits those sick with and dying of HIV AIDS in the villages   The area has been gutted of its work force  and every weekend I am reminded of the presence of death in the form of funerals  said Dernovsek   They are inescapable  as is the sorrow of this country  and they have become a way of life  Though Dernovsek often speaks directly to villagers  he also works to organize and educate groups of local people so they can reach out still further with vital information  But the kind of behavioral change that will make a difference in Lesotho is hard to teach   Infidelity is something that is ingrained in the culture here  said Dernovsek  He said he could not understand why it is acceptable for married people to have partners in addition to their spouses   Infidelity happens regularly and without moral reserve  When he is not visiting villages  Dernovsek teaches English  and sometimes math and science as well  at a village school  He also takes up other projects for which he must himself raise funds while in country  His pig breeding project  for instance  is well under way  He has completed fund raising  using a blog to reach the outside world  and has pigs on site  He will use them to teach the villagers how to raise and breed healthy animals  Dernovsek hopes to extend the project to teach the villagers how to preserve meat to achieve a more uniformly healthy diet than they currently have  Dernovsek is trying to fund and launch two other projects this summer  The Ketane Water Project will bring clean water to what Dernovsek calls  the most remote drought stricken areas of Lesotho  The Nohana Computer School will bring sustainable and widespread development  he said  Information on both is posted periodically in his blog  While Dernovsek s goals for the people of Lesotho are ambitious  his personal achievements there are no less so  Although there are a few situations in which he may use English and be understood  almost all of his communication

learned at VMI to face the unexpected with a cool head and a firm hand  because as HIV AIDS adviser to the Lesotho Catholic Bishops Conference  Dernovsek has found life to be a study in contrasts  Among these are the demographics of the region  With an entire generation wiped out by disease  the population is made up of the old and the young   I often work with old women and old men  I often teach their grandchildren  but rarely do I run into people my own age  said Dernovsek   The demographic simply isn t there  Tasked with helping people suffering from HIV AIDS and educating communities in prevention of the disease in a place where the rate of infection may be as high as 31 percent and life expectancy as low as age 37  Dernovsek has found that there is much to do  His primary project is to travel to villages to speak to groups advising prevention of HIV AIDS through abstinence from sexual activity until marriage and faithfulness afterward  He also visits those sick with and dying of HIV AIDS in the villages   The area has been gutted of its work force  and every weekend I am reminded of the presence of death in the form of funerals  said Dernovsek   They are inescapable  as is the sorrow of this country  and they have become a way of life  Though Dernovsek often speaks directly to villagers  he also works to organize and educate groups of local people so they can reach out still further with vital information  But the kind of behavioral change that will make a difference in Lesotho is hard to teach   Infidelity is something that is ingrained in the culture here  said Dernovsek  He said he could not understand why it is acceptable for married people to have partners in addition to their spouses   Infidelity happens regularly and without moral reserve  When he is not visiting villages  Dernovsek teaches English  and sometimes math and science as well  at a village school  He also takes up other projects for which he must himself raise funds while in country  His pig breeding project  for instance  is well under way  He has completed fund raising  using a blog to reach the outside world  and has pigs on site  He will use them to teach the villagers how to raise and breed healthy animals  Dernovsek hopes to extend the project to teach the villagers how to preserve meat to achieve a more uniformly healthy diet than they currently have  Dernovsek is trying to fund and launch two other projects this summer  The Ketane Water Project will bring clean water to what Dernovsek calls  the most remote drought stricken areas of Lesotho  The Nohana Computer School will bring sustainable and widespread development  he said  Information on both is posted periodically in his blog  While Dernovsek s goals for the people of Lesotho are ambitious  his personal achievements there are no less so  Although there are a few situations in which he may use English and be understood  almost all of his communication with the local people  from lectures on healthy living to directions for growing a diversified vegetable garden  must be carried out in the Sesotho language  He surprised himself recently when asked to give an impromptu talk to a large community gathering   Without skipping a beat  I was able to put together a whole speech on the go  As I was speaking  I noticed that I could adapt what I was saying based on the reactions of the people  An international studies major at VMI  Dernovsek has learned practical skills in the Peace Corps   I have learned to ride a horse  to farm dozens of varieties of vegetables  plumbing  electrical wiring  construction and many other things  he said   Basically  if I want to get something here  I have to do it myself  I wired my own solar panel  given to him for his computer school by the Bishops Conference  and rigged it to charge my laptop  Dernovsek says he developed  nerves of steel  at VMI   On a daily basis I run into situations that would test most nerves and tempers and push them to the limit  What do you do when you ve been driving in a taxi with 20 people that only seats 14 for the last six hours  your tire blows and you arrive at home in the middle of the night to find your dog missing and garden dying   The stress I face here is nothing compared to the stress that I not only learned to live with  but also to work productively with at VMI  VMI gave me the

caught on the third stoop during a free period doing push ups until my arms fall off Read about Dernovsek s time in Lesotho LEXINGTON  Va  July 14  2008  Andrew Dernovsek  06 gets around these days mostly on foot and on his stallion  Leluma  In the mountainous terrain of the African enclave Lesotho  villages can be 30 unpaved kilometers apart and many are perched on the tops of mountains  But every so often he goes worldwide with his Internet journal  For Dernosvek  logging on means riding in   40 minutes on horseback from the middle of nowhere  that is  That WiFi hotspot in the wilderness   at a Partners in Health clinic   allowed him to answer questions for this article  and  if he climbs the right mountain  he can even use his cell phone to talk to his family  It s a good thing he learned at VMI to face the unexpected with a cool head and a firm hand  because as HIV AIDS adviser to the Lesotho Catholic Bishops Conference  Dernovsek has found life to be a study in contrasts  Among these are the demographics of the region  With an entire generation wiped out by disease  the population is made up of the old and the young   I often work with old women and old men  I often teach their grandchildren  but rarely do I run into people my own age  said Dernovsek   The demographic simply isn t there  Tasked with helping people suffering from HIV AIDS and educating communities in prevention of the disease in a place where the rate of infection may be as high as 31 percent and life expectancy as low as age 37  Dernovsek has found that there is much to do  His primary project is to travel to villages to speak to groups advising prevention of HIV AIDS through abstinence from sexual activity until marriage and faithfulness afterward  He also visits those sick with and dying of HIV AIDS in the villages   The area has been gutted of its work force  and every weekend I am reminded of the presence of death in the form of funerals  said Dernovsek   They are inescapable  as is the sorrow of this country  and they have become a way of life  Though Dernovsek often speaks directly to villagers  he also works to organize and educate groups of local people so they can reach out still further with vital information  But the kind of behavioral change that will make a difference in Lesotho is hard to teach   Infidelity is something that is ingrained in the culture here  said Dernovsek  He said he could not understand why it is acceptable for married people to have partners in addition to their spouses   Infidelity happens regularly and without moral reserve  When he is not visiting villages  Dernovsek teaches English  and sometimes math and science as well  at a village school  He also takes up other projects for which he must himself raise funds while in country  His pig breeding project  for instance  is well under way  He has completed fund raising  using a blog to reach the outside world  and has pigs on site  He will use them to teach the villagers how to raise and breed healthy animals  Dernovsek hopes to extend the project to teach the villagers how to preserve meat to achieve a more uniformly healthy diet than they currently have  Dernovsek is trying to fund and launch two other projects this summer  The Ketane Water Project will bring clean water to what Dernovsek calls  the most remote drought stricken areas of Lesotho  The Nohana Computer School will bring sustainable and widespread development  he said  Information on both is posted periodically in his blog  While Dernovsek s goals for the people of Lesotho are ambitious  his personal achievements there are no less so  Although there are a few situations in which he may use English and be understood  almost all of his communication with the local people  from lectures on healthy living to directions for growing a diversified vegetable garden  must be carried out in the Sesotho language  He surprised himself recently when asked to give an impromptu talk to a large community gathering   Without skipping a beat  I was able to put together a whole speech on the go  As I was speaking  I noticed that I could adapt what I was saying based on the reactions of the people  An international studies major at VMI  Dernovsek has learned practical skills in the Peace Corps   I have learned to ride a horse  to farm dozens of varieties of vegetables  plumbing  electrical wiring  construction and many other things  he said   Basically  if I want to get something here  I have to do it myself  I wired my own solar panel  given to him for his computer school by the Bishops Conference  and rigged it to charge my laptop  Dernovsek says he developed  nerves of steel  at VMI   On a daily basis I run into situations that would test most nerves and tempers and push them to the limit  What do you do when you ve been driving in a taxi with 20 people that only seats 14 for the last six hours  your tire blows and you arrive at home in the middle of the night to find your dog missing and garden dying   The stress I face here is nothing compared to the stress that I not only learned to live with  but also to work productively with at VMI  VMI gave me the ability to balance all aspects of my life  including my tasks   People often ask me how I am able to keep so many projects going and focus on so many different things at once  The answer is simple  I prioritize and balance the different parts of my life and of my projects to meet the needs of the situation  I am confident that nowhere is this better ingrained into a person than in an environment like that of VMI  Dernovsek must carry these stresses with a special grace  as the people of Ketane have given him a special name in Sesotho  It draws on an older name for the area  Nohana  Thabo Nohana  his Sesotho name  means Joy of Nohana   The people told me that I brought joy to them with my presence  and they knew I would continue to bring joy in the future  he explained  He also brings with him a taste of what it means to be an American answering a president s call for service   I serve as an ambassador for the American people  he said   VMI makes citizen soldiers    If there were a draft or a national call for soldiers tomorrow  would I heed it  Unflinchingly   Until then  I am still serving my country    I am the only American that the vast majority of people in my area will

have learned to ride a horse  to farm dozens of varieties of vegetables  plumbing  electrical wiring  construction and many other things  he said   Basically  if I want to get something here  I have to do it myself  I wired my own solar panel  given to him for his computer school by the Bishops Conference  and rigged it to charge my laptop Dernovsek says he developed  nerves of steel  at VMI On a daily basis I run into situations that would test most nerves and tempers and push them to the limit  What do you do when you ve been driving in a taxi with 20 people that only seats 14 for the last six hours  your tire blows and you arrive at home in the middle of the night to find your dog missing and garden dying The stress I face here is nothing compared to the stress that I not only learned to live with  but also to work productively with at VMI  VMI gave me the ability to balance all aspects of my life  including my tasks People often ask me how I am able to keep so many projects going and focus on so many different things at once  The answer is simple  I prioritize and balance the different parts of my life and of my projects to meet the needs of the situation  I am confident that nowhere is this better ingrained into a person than in an environment like that of VMI Dernovsek must carry these stresses with a special grace  as the people of Ketane have given him a special name in Sesotho  It draws on an older name for the area  Nohana  Thabo Nohana  his Sesotho name  means Joy of Nohana The people told me that I brought joy to them with my presence  and they knew I would continue to bring joy in the future  he explained  He also brings with him a taste of what it means to be an American answering a president s call for service  I serve as an ambassador for the American people  he said   VMI makes citizen soldiers    If there were a draft or a national call for soldiers tomorrow  would I heed it  Unflinchingly   Until then  I am still serving my country    I am the only American that the vast majority of people in my area will ever meet  I serve to show them what an American really is   Share this entry Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google
