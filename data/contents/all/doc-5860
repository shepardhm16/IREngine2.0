following his talk    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  Epic Journeys  Exploration Inspire Interest in STEM Fields LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  4  2012   Dr  Neil deGrasse Tyson remained on post after his Wednesday morning plenary talk to have conversations with faculty  cadets  and W L students  Following a well attended book signing  Tyson spoke informally with a crowd of STEM students and professors assembled in Gillis Theater  addressing a range of issues based on cadet questions   What can we do as students to increase science literacy  Ian Cook  13 asked   Convince the electorate that the exploration of space is not only the grandest  most epic journey that we have ever embarked upon  but it is fundamental to the survival of our nation  responded Tyson  explaining that if our space program were inspiring individuals  there would be no lack of interest in STEM fields   NASA s got no business hauling astronauts to and from low earth orbit  That s not space  said Tyson   That s boldly going where hundreds have gone before  To get people excited about the space program  we need goals that are inspiring   The enemy of progress is that we don t have a grand vision that makes headlines every week  said Tyson  In defense of government s role in exploring the cosmos  Tyson cited examples of state funded ocean voyages that established trade routes across the globe  Just as it took government programs to push those frontiers  it will take government programs to explore space   Private enterprise will not lead the space frontier  said Tyson   The investor wants the quarterly reports  the annual reports  Visionary governments want their countries to last forever  so they can make a 10 year investment that private enterprise can t  Tyson spoke of his own motivations for advocating the advancement of America s space program   Yes  I have a horse in this race  and that horse is America  but so should everyone else  said Tyson   If what I say and do enlightens you  empowers you to make a more informed decision regarding your life  then my job as an educator has a return on that investment in America  Tyson offered inspiration to listeners  pointing out humanity s inherent desire to discover   We are the only mammals that are completely comfortable sleeping on our backs  and we sleep at night  What happens if you open your eyes  You see the stars  said Tyson   It has been suggested that deep within our primal genetic code is the curiosity that comes about when we open our eyes in the night and happen to be looking up   The extent to which you do not exploit that curiosity is the extent to which you deny all that you have been endowed with as a human   John Robertson IV  VMI  Related Articles State Secretary of Education Opens VMI STEM Conference
