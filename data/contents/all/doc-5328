Lee Couper  M D  graduated from VMI in 1937 and received his medical degree from the University of Virginia  A veteran of World War II  he served in the U  S  Army Medical Corps from 1941 1946  spending four years overseas with the St  Luke s Unit  Second Evacuation Hospital  He served in Great Britain and five campaigns in northern Europe with Fifth Corps  First Army  and separated from the service holding the rank of captain  He spent his post war career in the practice of anesthesiology  Couper died in Lexington  VA in 2001  The papers consist of extensive correspondence  to parents and other family  and two photograph albums documenting service during World War II  the bulk is dated 1942 1946  The letters cover a wide range of topics  including training in Great Britain  field hospital operations in Europe  and comments about daily aspects of war  In addition  the papers include a photograph album  1936 1937  dating from his VMI cadetship  and extensive material documenting various VMI Class of 1937 reunions  Selected examples  excerpted from original letters  France  1944 August 7   It is now one A M  and we have cleaned up the last of our business  the first break that we have had for some time  How long it will last I cannot imagine as they can snow us under so very rapidly  but we are now used to that  The war has moved so far from us that it is only a rumor but the wounded still come back to us and stand the trip remarkably well  suppose we will have to catch up as soon as the front settles down  The lads are really going to town and the map I have is now out of date  Recently there have been quite a few French civilians in who have been caught in the fighting and in the mines that the Germans sew without consideration  I don t mind wounded soldiers but kids and old women get me  they are only innocent bystanders  but we treat them as well as anyone and they are most gracious in their thanks  We have been listening to a broadcast from the States via short wave direct on a radio we have here in the operating room  It is good to hear the stuff uncanned for a change  There is an allied station that has opened since D Day that gives out excellent

six straight weeks of Twenty  Four hour drive  Yesterday I was fortunate enough to go with Jerry Dorman  our executive officer up to the front to see just exactly how things forward of us are in the medical line  We have never seen exactly the chain of evacuation to us  and we climbed in a jeep and took off for the zone  It was a real experience and thank God it was quiet  The front has moved so far from us that it was nice to get up to see that there was actually a war on  The country we traveled through had been fought over and thoroughly torn up in spots  Though some areas were blasted to pieces  others were as they always have been  The natural defense spots had all been contested and the whole place torn up  The square heads seem to hole up in houses and as a result almost all were wrecked  Towns especially were chewed up  In one place a large woods had been practically done away with  every tree had been blasted off about six feet up  One thing that impressed me was that there were no shell holes  all shells explode on the surface and don t dig holes  Air bombs  however  dig things up  At one place a bridge had been bombed and the stream bed so dug up that the stream had been diverted  The engineers do wonders with such places  They just build a bridge  prefabricated  beside the old one with a nice fill up to it  all done with bulldozers  One of the most impressive things about the front area is the smell of dead things in general  Animals are everywhere and smell up things in general One of the things that impressed me was the continual stream of civilian refugees coming home  They were walking and carrying bundles  riding bikes and in their high two wheeled carts  They all looked dead beat but they were at least going home  The Civil Affairs people have done a good job taking care of them  These people are all much different from those we first saw  they are quite friendly and wave to you  The others we have been used to were sullen and stolid

Collection Summary  John Lee Couper  M D  graduated from VMI in 1937 and received his medical degree from the University of Virginia  A veteran of World War II  he served in the U  S  Army Medical Corps from 1941 1946  spending four years overseas with the St  Luke s Unit  Second Evacuation Hospital  He served in Great Britain and five campaigns in northern Europe with Fifth Corps  First Army  and separated from the service holding the rank of captain  He spent his post war career in the practice of anesthesiology  Couper died in Lexington  VA in 2001  The papers consist of extensive correspondence  to parents and other family  and two photograph albums documenting service during World War II  the bulk is dated 1942 1946  The letters cover a wide range of topics  including training in Great Britain  field hospital operations in Europe  and comments about daily aspects of war  In addition  the papers include a photograph album  1936 1937  dating from his VMI cadetship  and extensive material documenting various VMI Class of 1937 reunions  Selected examples  excerpted from original letters  France  1944 August 7   It is now one A M  and we have cleaned up the last of our business  the first break that we have had for some time  How long it will last I cannot imagine as they can snow us under so very rapidly  but we are now used to that  The war has moved so far from us that it is only a rumor but the wounded still come back to us and stand the trip remarkably well  suppose we will have to catch up as soon as the front settles down  The lads are really going to town and the map I have is now out of date  Recently there have been quite a few French civilians in who have been caught in the fighting and in the mines that the Germans sew without consideration  I don t mind wounded soldiers but kids and old women get me  they are only innocent bystanders  but we treat them as well as anyone and they are most gracious in their thanks  We have been listening to a broadcast from the States via short wave direct on a radio we have here in the operating room  It is good to hear the stuff uncanned for a change  There is an allied station that has opened since D Day that gives out excellent stuff  mostly American that gives good listening  Grew quite tired of the B B C  though they still have the best news  France  1944 August 10   Things are quiet  we are getting our official rest after six straight weeks of Twenty  Four hour drive  Yesterday I was fortunate enough to go with Jerry Dorman  our executive officer up to the front to see just exactly how things forward of us are in the medical line  We have never seen exactly the chain of evacuation to us  and we climbed in a jeep and took off for the zone  It was a real experience and thank God it was quiet  The front has moved so far from us that it was nice to get up to see that there was actually a war on  The country we traveled through had been fought over and thoroughly torn up in spots  Though some areas were blasted to pieces  others were as they always have been  The natural defense spots had all been contested and the whole place torn up  The square heads seem to hole up in houses and as a result almost all were wrecked  Towns especially were chewed up  In one place a large woods had been practically done away with  every tree had been blasted off about six feet up  One thing that impressed me was that there were no shell holes  all shells explode on the surface and don t dig holes  Air bombs  however  dig things up  At one place a bridge had been bombed and the stream bed so dug up that the stream had been diverted  The engineers do wonders with such places  They just build a bridge  prefabricated  beside the old one with a nice fill up to it  all done with bulldozers  One of the most impressive things about the front area is the smell of dead things in general  Animals are everywhere and smell up things in general One of the things that impressed me was the continual stream of civilian refugees coming home  They were walking and carrying bundles  riding bikes and in their high two wheeled carts  They all looked dead beat but they were at least going home  The Civil Affairs people have done a good job taking care of them  These people are all much different from those we first saw  they are quite friendly and wave to you  The others we have been used to were sullen and stolid  made us wonder  The hinterland country is also much prettier than this hereabouts  Germany  1945 April 19   the outfit has been slowly collecting the personnel who have been scattered over Germany from one end of the front to the other  Many were in charge of German hospitals or slave labor camps and have real stories to tell  Some of the stories are real horror ones The payoff is when the civilians of a town are told about what goes on they say they did not know  it was the Nazis who did it I am all for setting a date for capitulation  then all resisters will be executed  Germany  1945 April 24   We have been treating recovered Allied   American POWs and I have never seen such pitiful wrecks of men  They are all starved beyond belief and any disease they may have   no matter how mild   becomes a major problem  The Krauts have certainly shown their true natures in their treatment  and to think how we coddle them in the camps in the States  These boys should be sent home to guard them The civilians are all sullen and aloof  here they made us fight and have not felt the war  Not far away is a camp where they exterminated political prisoners that is absolutely horrible  and yet they deny any part in it  German  1945 May 2   Have been awful busy and we have a tremendous load of patients  I have a ward now with a hundred on it that keeps me hopping all of the time  They are all medical patients and nearly all ex prisoners  It is a real League of Nations  At present I have the following nationalities   Americans  much in the minority  British  of all varieties  French  Belgians  Dutch  Czech  Australians  Canadians  Indians  plus one man from Cyprus All are very sick when they come but on rest and food nearly all brighten up  They all have a typical lethargic  whipped dog attitude   even the Americans when they come   but they soon snap out of it on a little honest treatment The English say that the Americans were treated worse than any but the Russians and they look it  With people as malnourished as these are on has to take even the most minor illness seriously   thank God for sulfonamides and penicillin  plus good food  VMI
