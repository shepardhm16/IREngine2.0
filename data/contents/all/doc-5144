Pony Express Pioneer Benjamin F  Ficklin  Class of 1849  Adventurer   Co Founder of the Pony Express Genealogy Alumni top level About Ben Ficklin  Benjamin Franklin Ficklin was known for his grand sense of adventure  His career was varied   surveyor  soldier  secret agent  scout   but he is  perhaps  best known as one of the founders of the famed Pony Express  Ben Ficklin was born in 1827 in Albemarle County  Virginia  the fifth son of Benajmin Ficklin and Eleanor Slaughter  His father  a Baptist minister who also ran a successful tobacco business  was determined to instill discipline in his son  In July 1845 Ben entered the Virginia Military Institute  where he soon became famous for his pranks and exploits  regularly disobeying the Institute s regulations  He set off fireworks beneath a reviewing stand  painted zebra stripes on the horse of Superintendent Francis H  Smith  and  placed two buckets of water over the door  leading to a faculty room    smeared the door handle with a quantity of filth  Ficklin was dismissed in late 1846 and   rather than return home in disgrace   he enlisted in the Army  He served for a brief time and was wounded during the Mexican War  He subsequently petitioned VMI for readmission  and he returned to the Institute and graduated in July 1849  worked briefly as a teacher following graduation  Ficklin quickly realized he was ill suited to that profession  He joined an express company in Alabama  and then moved west  He found employment with a freight line company on the western plains during the 1850 s and in 1857 began work on a series of western surveying expeditions  Ficklin returned to the express and stage business in 1859  capitalizing on the boom in commercial transportation fed by western expansion and the Pike s Peak Gold Rush  Along with several others  he formed the famed  Pony Express  courier service in January 1860 and served as a key partner in the venture until he left the company due to a conflict with another partner  Ficklin loved his adventurous life on the frontier  as expressed in an 1859 letter to Superintendent Francis Smith   If you would like to take a buffalo hunt on the Plains  come out about August 15th  It will take two weeks  not cost anything  and is the most exciting sport in the world except making love to the girls  Smith maintained a cordial relationship with Ficklin  as indicated in this letter from 1860  You have no idea what a commotion occasioned in the City of  Gotham  when it was known that a package of gold was at the Express office for Col  F H S    all the way from Kansas   from B F F  Even the young ladies were on tip toe on the occasion  I have no doubt surmises were afloat that orders were received by the said F H S  for the manufacture of a plain gold ring  But who was to be the lucky lass for whom this ring was designed  To answer all these queries was out of the question   Pony Express  would break down in the effort  so I had only to say in your own language   I had not time to attend to such matters  But more seriously the gold has arrived   I thank you for it  It is not only a fine specimen of Pike s Peak  but it is a grateful remembrance from one whom I have so much reason to respect  When the Civil War began in 1861  Ficklin returned to his native Virginia to assist the Confederate cause  Early in the war he saw active field service  he subsequently served as a Confederate government purchasing agent in England and worked in intelligence  Postwar  he operated a stage coach express business in Texas  having obtained significant government contracts for carrying mail in the Texas frontier region  Ever the adventurer  Ficklin persisted despite frequent Comanche attacks on the stage lines and stations  Ficklin s business venture required regular trips to Washington  DC to deal with the U  S  Post Office bureaucracy  In March 1871  while in the city to lobby for mail contracts  Ficklin and a friend dined at a Georgetown restaurant and a fishbone became lodged in Ficklin s throat  He died several days later  as a result of an artery being slashed by the doctor attempting to remove the bone  He is buried in Maplewood Cemetery in Charlottesville  Virginia  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non
