for you These are the words Jacob Bushong wrote to his sweetheart  Sarah Strickler  early in the year 1814  Four years later on March 5  1818  they married  Jacob built a small log cabin for his bride  today the 1818 House  Soon  the growing family needed more space and the larger home was constructed  Of their six children  only four lived to adulthood  Harrison  a mechanic and builder who died before he was forty  Elizabeth  a talented needleworker with a keen mind  Anderson  a farmer like his father and the first to marry and bring the joy of grandchildren to the farm  and Franklin  an artistic fellow who settled in the West before Civil War gripped the nation  In 1864 the Bushong s fertile fields of wheat became a battleground  Three generations of the family took shelter in the basement of their home  After the battle  they continued to live in the basement as their home became a hospital  Determined and strong  they rebuilt in the aftermath of war  The family continued to grow and continued to farm the land  Not until 1942 did the property pass out of their hands  By 1944 it was owned by George Collins  VMI Class of 1911  and was on its way to becoming a permanent memorial to those participating in the Battle of New Market  The 1825 House Reflecting their growing prosperity  Jacob and Sarah built a larger home in 1825  Their new home would face south toward the town of New Market  one mile away  As their family continued to grow  the Bushong family added onto this house  and by about 1850 it appeared as it does today  By 1864  this house was the home of three generations of the family  The house reflects the Federal architectural style  1810 1830  with symmetrical three bay front  pediment portico and vertical lines  Wooden clapboard construction with limestone foundation and a wooden shingle roof are common elements of Valley homes  During the battle seven members of the family took refuge in the cellar  Jacob  Sarah  Anderson  his wife Elizabeth  Willie  Carrie and Elizabeth  Throughout the long Sunday they could hear cannon  musketry and shouts of the soldiers fighting around their home  Miraculously the house received little damage  The Barn After the battle  the barn became a field hospital for both Union and Confederate soldiers  Remarkably Jacob Bushong s barn was not  Sheridanized  or burned during the Shenandoah Campaign of 1864  In a family letter written 4 23 1865 the fate of the barn is described  Providence will still provide for us  we have never suffered for anything in the eating line notwithstanding all the barns were burned last fall and nearly everything else in the eating line destroyed  Your father s barn was not burned  The original structure  shown in the 1899 image to the right  was struck by lightning and burned about 1 00 P M  on Wednesday  July 6  1939  It was rebuilt on the original foundation in 1942  It was fairly common for a farmer to have to replace a barn once or twice during his life because of fire    1818 House When Jacob Bushong and Sarah Strickler were married on March 5  1818  they first built a two story log cabin facing east along the Valley Pike  For the first 7 years the young family would live here  The house was soon refined by the addition of clapboard siding  The needs of a growing family required more space and a new  larger home was completed in 1825  When their son Anderson married  he and his new bride Elizabeth Swartz moved into the 1818 house      Blacksmith Shop The Bushongs operated complete blacksmith and wheelwright shops which provided supplemental income for the family  Jacob s son Harrison was known for his skill with tools and would have been called a mechanic  Farmers from the neighborhood such as Mr  Strayer or Mr  Hupp could bring their tools in for repair  The 1850 Census listed Harrison as a  machine maker  but his brother Anderson only as a  farmer  like their father  In the 1840 s Harrison designed and built an early wheat threshing machine in these shops  He subsequently submitted a model to the US Patent Office but never received a patent for his invention    The Hen House Farmyard fowl and eggs were important elements of family meals  The daily chore of gathering eggs was shared by the Bushong children  William  age four and Sarah  age six  Chickens and roosters usually roamed the yard during the day  but could be found on roosts or perches and in nests at night    Loom and Meat storage By the 1840 s Mrs  Bushong was buying her cloth from local dry goods merchants like J R  Strayer   Co and making clothing for the family  During the Civil War  commercially made cloth became very expensive and scarce  Many southern families brought ancient looms out and began to make homespun cloth  For many women in the south homespun cloth became a symbol of both patriotism and perseverance  Mrs  Bushong originally set up their loom in the front room  frame section  and stored their meat in the back room  log section  In a letter written 4 23 1865 to son Frank Bushong  the state of the family s clothing is clearly stated  they still have enough to eat and to wear  Tho as to the wearing we have to make out with things we would scarcely thought fit to be seen in   now we patch and fix up the old clothes until we make ourselves believe we look right      Bake Oven Many families constructed free standing bake ovens to avoid the heat and smell associated with the daily chore of baking  The fire was built in the oven itself  Once the brick was thoroughly heated  the ashes were removed and the items to be baked were placed in tin pans  Tools such as paddle like peel for moving the pans  the swab for cooling the baking surface and the hoe for ash removal were vital to the operation        Field of Lost Shoes During the battle  this field  just north of the Bushong House  was planted in spring wheat  It would become the site of the fiercest fighting  Five days of rain had made the field a quagmire  As the Federal and Confederate infantry pushed back and forth through the foot tall wheat  shoes and socks were sucked from their feet by the clinging mud leaving one soldier to name this place  The Field of Lost Shoes  Ice House and Dairy Like many families  Mr  Bushong harvested blocks of ice from small ponds during the winter  The ice was packed in sawdust and straw and was stored in the back of this limestone structure  Run off from the melting ice came through a pipe and filled a stone trough in the front part of the building called the dairy  The ice house and dairy was constructed in the fall of 1871  A family letter from Anderson to his brother Frank written January 28  1872 tells how it was built   Frank we had some very cold weather and very dry   It pleased me very well I filled my ice house that I built last faul  I built it out of rock 12 feet in the clear dairy for milk 12 feet by 7  I set it between the pump and hen house  In a letter written on December 18  1873  Anderson told his brother Frank  I had my ice house full and plenty of ice left for outher people  Frank I would not do without my ice house for one thousand dollars  You don t believe how I enjoy the good cold ice water on a hot summers day and the best of all is the good cold milk and hard butter at mele  We made 200 l bs butter last summer and 200 l bs this summer  that makes 400 l bs    Orchard The family maintained an orchard planted with several varieties of apples  peaches  pears and quince  Jacob took great pride in his yearly fruit harvest and the lucrative products such as cider and apple butter  The orchard was delineated by a rail fence described by VMI Cadet John Howard as  ordinary  and  about four feet high  The blossoms had just fallen from the trees on May 15  1864 when the Confederate infantry stalled along the rail fence separating the orchard from Mr  Bushong s wheat field  Around 2 00 P M  Federal artillery and musketry fire punched a hole in the Confederate line here  It was at this moment that the VMI Cadets moved into the breech and the entire Confederate line charged across the  Field of Lost Shoes  The present day orchard was replanted with heirloom variety fruit trees as part of the Bushong Farm restoration in the 1960 s    Summer Kitchen For most of the year food preparation was done here to keep food smells and dangerous heat away from the main house  The arduous process of keeping the family fed was one of the main duties for Mrs  Bushong  her daughter Elizabeth  also called Betsy and daughter in law Elizabeth  The family did own slaves which helped to offset the division of labor on the farm  The earliest documentation for slaves is in the 1820 Census showing one female slave under fourteen years of age  The 1857 Birth Record for Shenandoah County showed that Jacob Bushong had one female slave named Mary who gave birth to a son named Israel  The 1860 Census showed three slaves working on the property  a 27 year old male  a 24 year old female  Mary  and a 3 year old boy  Israel  This family most likely lived in the loft above the kitchen      Wheelwright Shop Transportation was important to the farmer  The wheelwright shop was the place to make and repair wheels for wagons and buggies  It was also a general carpentry shop for the farm  To be a mechanic in this trade required a high degree of math and geometry  The hub had to be bored just right and the spokes must be mounted with just the right angle or the wheel collapses  Not every farm could boast of a blacksmith and a wheelwright shop  Farmers in the neighborhood could bring their broken wheels to Harrison Bushong to repair  This building houses a collection of woodworking tools and period farm implements  Harrison received a letter written by a friend February 24  1851 regarding his love of the shops  I hope this reaches you you may again be restored to your usual health again and find you engaged in the shop the place where you so much delight to occupy      VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  VMI MUSEUMS  VMI Museum   Virginia Museum of the Civil War   Stonewall Jackson House

generations of the family took shelter in the basement of their home  After the battle  they continued to live in the basement as their home became a hospital  Determined and strong  they rebuilt in the aftermath of war  The family continued to grow and continued to farm the land  Not until 1942 did the property pass out of their hands  By 1944 it was owned by George Collins  VMI Class of 1911  and was on its way to becoming a permanent memorial to those participating in the Battle of New Market  The 1825 House Reflecting their growing prosperity  Jacob and Sarah built a larger home in 1825  Their new home would face south toward the town of New Market  one mile away  As their family continued to grow  the Bushong family added onto this house  and by about 1850 it appeared as it does today  By 1864  this house was the home of three generations of the family  The house reflects the Federal architectural style  1810 1830  with symmetrical three bay front  pediment portico and vertical lines  Wooden clapboard construction with limestone foundation and a wooden shingle roof are common elements of Valley homes  During the battle seven members of the family took refuge in the cellar  Jacob  Sarah  Anderson  his wife Elizabeth  Willie  Carrie and Elizabeth  Throughout the long Sunday they could hear cannon  musketry and shouts of the soldiers fighting around their home  Miraculously the house received little damage  The Barn After the battle  the barn became a field hospital for both Union and Confederate soldiers  Remarkably Jacob Bushong s barn was not  Sheridanized  or burned during the Shenandoah Campaign of 1864  In a family letter written 4 23 1865 the fate of the barn is described  Providence will still provide for us  we have never suffered for anything in the eating line notwithstanding all the barns were burned last fall and nearly everything else in the eating line destroyed  Your father s barn was not burned  The original structure  shown in the 1899 image to the right  was struck by lightning and burned about 1 00 P M  on Wednesday  July 6  1939  It was rebuilt on the original foundation in 1942  It was fairly common for a farmer to have to replace a barn once or twice during his life because of fire    1818 House When Jacob Bushong and Sarah Strickler were married on March 5  1818  they first built a two story log cabin facing east along the Valley Pike  For the first 7 years the young family would live here  The house was soon refined by the addition of clapboard siding  The needs of a growing family required more space and a new  larger home was completed in 1825  When their son Anderson married  he and his new bride Elizabeth Swartz moved into the 1818 house      Blacksmith Shop The Bushongs operated complete blacksmith and wheelwright shops which provided supplemental income for the family  Jacob s son Harrison was known for his skill with tools and would have been called a mechanic  Farmers from the neighborhood such as Mr  Strayer or Mr  Hupp could bring their tools in for repair  The 1850 Census listed Harrison as a  machine maker  but his brother Anderson only as a  farmer  like their father  In the 1840 s Harrison designed and built an early wheat threshing machine in these shops  He subsequently submitted a model to the US Patent Office but never received a patent for his invention    The Hen House Farmyard fowl and eggs were important elements of family meals  The daily chore of gathering eggs was shared by the Bushong children  William  age four and Sarah  age six  Chickens and roosters usually roamed the yard during the day  but could be found on roosts or perches and in nests at night    Loom and Meat storage By the 1840 s Mrs  Bushong was buying her cloth from local dry goods merchants like J R  Strayer   Co and making clothing for the family  During the Civil War  commercially made cloth became very expensive and scarce  Many southern families brought ancient looms out and began to make homespun cloth  For many women in the south homespun cloth became a symbol of both patriotism and perseverance  Mrs  Bushong originally set up their loom in the front room  frame section  and stored their meat in the back room  log section  In a letter written 4 23 1865 to son Frank Bushong  the state of the family s clothing is clearly stated  they still have enough to eat and to wear  Tho as to the wearing we have to make out with things we would scarcely thought fit to be seen in   now we patch and fix up the old clothes until we make ourselves believe we look right      Bake Oven Many families constructed free standing bake ovens to avoid the heat and smell associated with the daily chore of baking  The fire was built in the oven itself  Once the brick was thoroughly heated  the ashes were removed and the items to be baked were placed in tin pans  Tools such as paddle like peel for moving the pans  the swab for cooling the baking surface and the hoe for ash removal were vital to the operation        Field of Lost Shoes During the battle  this field  just north of the Bushong House  was planted in spring wheat  It would become the site of the fiercest fighting  Five days of rain had made the field a quagmire  As the Federal and Confederate infantry pushed back and forth through the foot tall wheat  shoes and socks were sucked from their feet by the clinging mud leaving one soldier to name this place  The Field of Lost Shoes  Ice House and Dairy Like many families  Mr  Bushong harvested blocks of ice from small ponds during the winter  The ice was packed in sawdust and straw and was stored in the back of this limestone structure  Run off from the melting ice came through a pipe and filled a stone trough in the front part of the building called the dairy  The ice house and dairy was constructed in the fall of 1871  A family letter from Anderson to his brother Frank written January 28  1872 tells how it was built   Frank we had some very cold weather and very dry   It pleased me very well I filled my ice house that I built last faul  I built it out of rock 12 feet in the clear dairy for milk 12 feet by 7  I set it between the pump and hen house  In a letter written on December 18  1873  Anderson told his brother Frank  I had my ice house full and plenty of ice left for outher people  Frank I would not do without my ice house for one thousand dollars  You don t believe how I enjoy the good cold ice water on a hot summers day and the best of all is the good cold milk and hard butter at mele  We made 200 l bs butter last summer and 200 l bs this summer  that makes 400 l bs    Orchard The family maintained an orchard planted with several varieties of apples  peaches  pears and quince  Jacob took great pride in his yearly fruit harvest and the lucrative products such as cider and apple butter  The orchard was delineated by a rail fence described by VMI Cadet John Howard as  ordinary  and  about four feet high  The blossoms had just fallen from the trees on May 15  1864 when the Confederate infantry stalled along the rail fence separating the orchard from Mr  Bushong s wheat field  Around 2 00 P M  Federal artillery and musketry fire punched a hole in the Confederate line here  It was at this moment that the VMI Cadets moved into the breech and the entire Confederate line charged across the  Field of Lost Shoes  The present day orchard was replanted with heirloom variety fruit trees as part of the Bushong Farm restoration in the 1960 s    Summer Kitchen For most of the year food preparation was done here to keep food smells and dangerous heat away from the main house  The arduous process of keeping the family fed was one of the main duties for Mrs  Bushong  her daughter Elizabeth  also called Betsy and daughter in law Elizabeth  The family did own slaves which helped to offset the division of labor on the farm  The earliest documentation for slaves is in the 1820 Census showing one female slave under fourteen years of age  The 1857 Birth Record for Shenandoah County showed that Jacob Bushong had one female slave named Mary who gave birth to a son named Israel  The 1860 Census showed three slaves working on the property  a 27 year old male  a 24 year old female  Mary  and a 3 year old boy  Israel  This family most likely lived in the loft above the kitchen      Wheelwright Shop Transportation was important to the farmer  The wheelwright shop was the place to make and repair wheels for wagons and buggies  It was also a general carpentry shop for the farm  To be a mechanic in this trade required a high degree of math and geometry  The hub had to be bored just right and the spokes must be mounted with just the right angle or the wheel collapses  Not every farm could boast of a blacksmith and a wheelwright shop  Farmers in the neighborhood could bring their broken wheels to Harrison Bushong to repair  This building houses a collection of woodworking tools and period farm implements  Harrison received a letter written by a friend February 24  1851 regarding his love of the shops  I hope this reaches you you may again be restored to your usual health again and find you engaged in the shop the place where you so much delight to occupy      VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  VMI MUSEUMS  VMI Museum

 Christmas Eve and day        Explore the Bushong Farm and Homestead  Though I am not of wealth  I have a treasury of love for you These are the words Jacob Bushong wrote to his sweetheart  Sarah Strickler  early in the year 1814  Four years later on March 5  1818  they married  Jacob built a small log cabin for his bride  today the 1818 House  Soon  the growing family needed more space and the larger home was constructed  Of their six children  only four lived to adulthood  Harrison  a mechanic and builder who died before he was forty  Elizabeth  a talented needleworker with a keen mind  Anderson  a farmer like his father and the first to marry and bring the joy of grandchildren to the farm  and Franklin  an artistic fellow who settled in the West before Civil War gripped the nation  In 1864 the Bushong s fertile fields of wheat became a battleground  Three generations of the family took shelter in the basement of their home  After the battle  they continued to live in the basement as their home became a hospital  Determined and strong  they rebuilt in the aftermath of war  The family continued to grow and continued to farm the land  Not until 1942 did the property pass out of their hands  By 1944 it was owned by George Collins  VMI Class of 1911  and was on its way to becoming a permanent memorial to those participating in the Battle of New Market  The 1825 House Reflecting their growing prosperity  Jacob and Sarah built a larger home in 1825  Their new home would face south toward the town of New Market  one mile away  As their family continued to grow  the Bushong family added onto this house  and by about 1850 it appeared as it does today  By 1864  this house was the home of three generations of the family  The house reflects the Federal architectural style  1810 1830  with symmetrical three bay front  pediment portico and vertical lines  Wooden clapboard construction with limestone foundation and a wooden shingle roof are common elements of Valley homes  During the battle seven members of the family took refuge in the cellar  Jacob  Sarah  Anderson  his wife Elizabeth  Willie  Carrie and Elizabeth  Throughout the long Sunday they could hear cannon  musketry and shouts of the soldiers fighting around their home  Miraculously the house received little damage  The Barn After the battle  the barn became a field hospital for both Union and Confederate soldiers  Remarkably Jacob Bushong s barn was not  Sheridanized  or burned during the Shenandoah Campaign of 1864  In a family letter written 4 23 1865 the fate of the barn is described  Providence will still provide for us  we have never suffered for anything in the eating line notwithstanding all the barns were burned last fall and nearly everything else in the eating line destroyed  Your father s barn was not burned  The original structure  shown in the 1899 image to the right  was struck by lightning and burned about 1 00 P M  on Wednesday  July 6  1939  It was rebuilt on the original foundation in 1942  It was fairly common for a farmer to have to replace a barn once or twice during his life because of fire    1818 House When Jacob Bushong and Sarah Strickler were married on March 5  1818  they first built a two story log cabin facing east along the Valley Pike  For the first 7 years the young family would live here  The house was soon refined by the addition of clapboard siding  The needs of a growing family required more space and a new  larger home was completed in 1825  When their son Anderson married  he and his new bride Elizabeth Swartz moved into the 1818 house      Blacksmith Shop The Bushongs operated complete blacksmith and wheelwright shops which provided supplemental income for the family  Jacob s son Harrison was known for his skill with tools and would have been called a mechanic  Farmers from the neighborhood such as Mr  Strayer or Mr  Hupp could bring their tools in for repair  The 1850 Census listed Harrison as a  machine maker  but his brother Anderson only as a  farmer  like their father  In the 1840 s Harrison designed and built an early wheat threshing machine in these shops  He subsequently submitted a model to the US Patent Office but never received a patent for his invention    The Hen House Farmyard fowl and eggs were important elements of family meals  The daily chore of gathering eggs was shared by the Bushong children  William  age four and Sarah  age six  Chickens and roosters usually roamed the yard during the day  but could be found on roosts or perches and in nests at night    Loom and Meat storage By the 1840 s Mrs  Bushong was buying her cloth from local dry goods merchants like J R  Strayer   Co and making clothing for the family  During the Civil War  commercially made cloth became very expensive and scarce  Many southern families brought ancient looms out and began to make homespun cloth  For many women in the south homespun cloth became a symbol of both patriotism and perseverance  Mrs  Bushong originally set up their loom in the front room  frame section  and stored their meat in the back room  log section  In a letter written 4 23 1865 to son Frank Bushong  the state of the family s clothing is clearly stated  they still have enough to eat and to wear  Tho as to the wearing we have to make out with things we would scarcely thought fit to be seen in   now we patch and fix up the old clothes until we make ourselves believe we look right      Bake Oven Many families constructed free standing bake ovens to avoid the heat and smell associated with the daily chore of baking  The fire was built in the oven itself  Once the brick was thoroughly heated  the ashes were removed and the items to be baked were placed in tin pans  Tools such as paddle like peel for moving the pans  the swab for cooling the baking surface and the hoe for ash removal were vital to the operation        Field of Lost Shoes During the battle  this field  just north of the Bushong House  was planted in spring wheat  It would become the site of the fiercest fighting  Five days of rain had made the field a quagmire  As the Federal and Confederate infantry pushed back and forth through the foot tall wheat  shoes and socks were sucked from their feet by the clinging mud leaving one soldier to name this place  The Field of Lost Shoes  Ice House and Dairy Like many families  Mr  Bushong harvested blocks of ice from small ponds during the winter  The ice was packed in sawdust and straw and was stored in the back of this limestone structure  Run off from the melting ice came through a pipe and filled a stone trough in the front part of the building called the dairy  The ice house and dairy was constructed in the fall of 1871  A family letter from Anderson to his brother Frank written January 28  1872 tells how it was built   Frank we had some very cold weather and very dry   It pleased me very well I filled my ice house that I built last faul  I built it out of rock 12 feet in the clear dairy for milk 12 feet by 7  I set it between the pump and hen house  In a letter written on December 18  1873  Anderson told his brother Frank  I had my ice house full and plenty of ice left for outher people  Frank I would not do without my ice house for one thousand dollars  You don t believe how I enjoy the good cold ice water on a hot summers day and the best of all is the good cold milk and hard butter at mele  We made 200 l bs butter last summer and 200 l bs this summer  that makes 400 l bs    Orchard The family maintained an orchard planted with several varieties of apples  peaches  pears and quince  Jacob took great pride in his yearly fruit harvest and the lucrative products such as cider and apple butter  The orchard was delineated by a rail fence described by VMI Cadet John Howard as  ordinary  and  about four feet high  The blossoms had just fallen from the trees on May 15  1864 when the Confederate infantry stalled along the rail fence separating the orchard from Mr  Bushong s wheat field  Around 2 00 P M  Federal artillery and musketry fire punched a hole in the Confederate line here  It was at this moment that the VMI Cadets moved into the breech and the entire Confederate line charged across the  Field of Lost Shoes  The present day orchard was replanted with heirloom variety fruit trees as part of the Bushong Farm restoration in the 1960 s    Summer Kitchen For most of the year food preparation was done here to keep food smells and dangerous heat away from the main house  The arduous process of keeping the family fed was one of the main duties for Mrs  Bushong  her daughter Elizabeth  also called Betsy and daughter in law Elizabeth  The family did own slaves which helped to offset the division of labor on the farm  The earliest documentation for slaves is in the 1820 Census showing one female slave under fourteen years of age  The 1857 Birth Record for Shenandoah County showed that Jacob Bushong had one female slave named Mary who gave birth to a son named Israel  The 1860 Census showed three slaves working on the property  a 27 year old male  a 24 year old female  Mary  and a 3 year old boy  Israel  This family most likely lived in the loft above the kitchen      Wheelwright Shop Transportation was important to the farmer  The wheelwright shop was the place to make and repair wheels for wagons and buggies  It was also a general carpentry shop for the farm  To be a mechanic in this trade required a high degree of math and geometry  The hub had to be bored just right and the spokes must be mounted with just the right angle or the wheel collapses  Not every farm could boast of a blacksmith and a wheelwright shop  Farmers in the neighborhood could bring their broken wheels to Harrison Bushong to repair  This building houses a collection of woodworking tools and period farm implements  Harrison received a letter written by a friend February 24  1851 regarding his love of the shops  I hope this reaches you you may again be restored to your usual health again and find you engaged in the shop the place where you so much delight to occupy      Explore the Bushong Farm and Homestead  Though I am not of wealth  I have a treasury of love for you These are the words Jacob Bushong wrote to his sweetheart  Sarah Strickler  early in the year 1814  Four years later on March 5  1818  they married

larger home in 1825  Their new home would face south toward the town of New Market  one mile away  As their family continued to grow  the Bushong family added onto this house  and by about 1850 it appeared as it does today  By 1864  this house was the home of three generations of the family  The house reflects the Federal architectural style  1810 1830  with symmetrical three bay front  pediment portico and vertical lines  Wooden clapboard construction with limestone foundation and a wooden shingle roof are common elements of Valley homes  During the battle seven members of the

Bushong s barn was not  Sheridanized  or burned during the Shenandoah Campaign of 1864  In a family letter written 4 23 1865 the fate of the barn is described  Providence will still provide for us  we have never suffered for anything in the eating line notwithstanding all the barns were burned last fall and nearly everything else in the eating line destroyed  Your father s barn was not burned  The original structure  shown in the 1899 image to the right  was struck by lightning and burned about 1 00 P M  on Wednesday  July 6  1939  It was rebuilt on the original foundation in 1942  It was

married on March 5  1818  they first built a two story log cabin facing east along the Valley Pike  For the first 7 years the young family would live here  The house was soon refined by the addition of clapboard siding  The needs of a growing family required more space and a new  larger home was completed in 1825  When their son Anderson married  he and his new bride Elizabeth Swartz moved into

blacksmith and wheelwright shops which provided supplemental income for the family  Jacob s son Harrison was known for his skill with tools and would have been called a mechanic  Farmers from the neighborhood such as Mr  Strayer or Mr  Hupp could bring their tools in for repair  The 1850 Census listed Harrison as a  machine maker  but his brother Anderson only as a  farmer  like their father  In the 1840 s Harrison designed and built an early wheat threshing machine in these shops  He subsequently submitted a model to the US Patent Office but never received a patent for his invention

baking  The fire was built in the oven itself  Once the brick was thoroughly heated  the ashes were removed and the items to be baked were placed in tin pans  Tools such as paddle like peel for moving the pans  the swab for cooling the baking surface and the hoe for ash removal were vital to the operation Bake Oven Many families constructed free standing bake ovens to avoid the heat and smell

maintained an orchard planted with several varieties of apples  peaches  pears and quince  Jacob took great pride in his yearly fruit harvest and the lucrative products such as cider and apple butter  The orchard was delineated by a rail fence described by VMI Cadet John Howard as  ordinary  and  about four feet high  The blossoms had just fallen from the trees on May 15  1864 when the Confederate infantry stalled along the rail fence separating the orchard from Mr  Bushong s wheat field  Around 2 00 P M  Federal artillery and musketry fire punched a hole in the Confederate line here  It was at this moment that the VMI Cadets moved into the breech and the entire Confederate line charged across the  Field of Lost Shoes  The present day orchard was replanted with heirloom variety fruit trees

was one of the main duties for Mrs  Bushong  her daughter Elizabeth  also called Betsy and daughter in law Elizabeth  The family did own slaves which helped to offset the division of labor on the farm  The earliest documentation for slaves is in the 1820 Census showing one female slave under fourteen years of age  The 1857 Birth Record for Shenandoah County showed that Jacob Bushong had one female slave named Mary who gave birth to a son named Israel  The 1860 Census showed three slaves working on the property  a 27 year old male  a 24 year old female  Mary  and a 3 year old boy  Israel  This

was the place to make and repair wheels for wagons and buggies  It was also a general carpentry shop for the farm  To be a mechanic in this trade required a high degree of math and geometry  The hub had to be bored just right and the spokes must be mounted with just the right angle or the wheel collapses  Not every farm could boast of a blacksmith and a wheelwright shop  Farmers in the neighborhood could bring their broken wheels to Harrison Bushong to repair  This building houses a collection of woodworking tools and period farm implements  Harrison received a letter written by a friend February 24  1851 regarding his love of the shops  I hope this reaches you you may again be restored to your usual health again and find you engaged in the shop the place where you so much
