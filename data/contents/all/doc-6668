Summer Program Gives Theater a Helping Hand  In the world of academia  Shakespeare and math do not seem to have much in common  But in the real world this summer  the two seeming academic opposites walked hand in hand  The Applied and Industrial Mathematics program at VMI made sure of that when cadet Ryan Poffenbarger  16 was assigned the task of crunching numbers for the American Shakespeare Center in Staunton  Thanks to his research  the organization now has a better grasp on how to market its product   It s going to help us target our marketing in a much better way rather than just making queries  said Amy Wratchford  the managing director for the center   We have all of this data we don t have the time or expertise to dig into  They helped us make sense of all of our data  Through his analysis  Poffenbarger uncovered a number of trends at the center and the Blackfriars Playhouse  including the number of customers who attended multiple performances  the number who tended to return each year  and the number of seats that sold the most often  He presented this information to Wratchford in June   It was a lot of detective work  Poffenbarger said   They know the business part of the Shakespeare Center better than I do  so I was looking for things that would be related to making business decisions for them   That s the role of the analyst  look at the numbers  do the technical stuff  and help them make smart decisions  said Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics and AIM coordinator   They are ultimately going to make the decision about what to do  We just try to help them make fewer guesses  According to Maj  Geoff Cox  also an assistant professor of applied mathematics  who served as the cadet s supervisor  the role of the data analyst is only to crunch the numbers  not make recommendations   There is a lot of uncertainty  Cox said   You want to tell them   This is what we found  here s a possible interpretation  But there are many others  Poffenbarger s project was one of three by cadets associated with AIM  Another was with an investment firm in Lexington  while the third was with a local manufacturer  The AIM program is a collaboration of the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  the applied math department  and external clients  AIM generates revenue from the client  which pays the cadet s stipend  and VCUR supports the professor s stipend via its Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  Poffenbarger was the 17th cadet to work with David over the last three years  He learned a great deal from the experience  and not just in math   The one thing I learned the most was programming  said Poffenbarger  who noted that he often had to reformat the data sent to him from the Shakespeare Center   I went from zero programming experience  aside from HTML  to writing what I thought were pretty complex solutions to a formatting problem  David became aware of the predicament at the Shakespeare Center while he was giving a presentation of his findings from an AIM project for the United Way  Wratchford happened to be in attendance  and she immediately began thinking of how the VMI program could help her outfit   She thought it was a really cool idea  said David   She was definitely excited about what quantitative thinking can do to make a place work better  And that is the purpose of AIM  So often  it is hard to visualize how higher math can be beneficial in real world situations  AIM takes care of that   It s about going out and getting real world problems from government  business   and  industry   and  bringing them back to have our VMI cadets solve them  said David   It s a good contrast from the classroom  added Cox  Did VMI s AIM program help  Wratchford seemed encouraged by the findings   We ve been very pleased  she said   They  helped  us get our vision wrapped around our patron and donor database  And the AIM team proved that maybe Shakespeare and mathematics do belong together  By Chris

Science   Mathematics   Applied Mathematics   Applying Math   To Shakespeare Applying Math   To Shakespeare AIM Summer Program Gives Theater a Helping Hand  In the world of academia  Shakespeare and math do not seem to have much in common  But in the real world this summer  the two seeming academic opposites walked hand in hand  The Applied and Industrial Mathematics program at VMI made sure of that when cadet Ryan Poffenbarger  16 was assigned the task of crunching numbers for the American Shakespeare Center in Staunton  Thanks to his research  the organization now has a better grasp on how to market its product   It s going to help us target our marketing in a much better way rather than just making queries  said Amy Wratchford  the managing director for the center   We have all of this data we don t have the time or expertise to dig into  They helped us make sense of all of our data  Through his analysis  Poffenbarger uncovered a number of trends at the center and the Blackfriars Playhouse  including the number of customers who attended multiple performances  the number who tended to return each year  and the number of seats that sold the most often  He presented this information to Wratchford in June   It was a lot of detective work  Poffenbarger said   They know the business part of the Shakespeare Center better than I do  so I was looking for things that would be related to making business decisions for them   That s the role of the analyst  look at the numbers  do the technical stuff  and help them make smart decisions  said Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics and AIM coordinator   They are ultimately going to make the decision about what to do  We just try to help them make fewer guesses  According to Maj  Geoff Cox  also an assistant professor of applied mathematics  who served as the cadet s supervisor  the role of the data analyst is only to crunch the numbers  not make recommendations   There is a lot of uncertainty  Cox said   You want to tell them   This is what we found  here s a possible interpretation  But there are many others  Poffenbarger s project was one of three by cadets associated with AIM  Another was with an investment firm in Lexington  while the third was with a local manufacturer  The AIM program is a collaboration of the VMI Center for Undergraduate Research  the applied math department  and external clients  AIM generates revenue from the client  which pays the cadet s stipend  and VCUR supports the professor s stipend via its Summer Undergraduate Research Institute  Poffenbarger was the 17th cadet to work with David over the last three years  He learned a great deal from the experience  and not just in math   The one thing I learned the most was programming  said Poffenbarger  who noted that he often had to reformat the data sent to him from the Shakespeare Center   I went from zero programming experience  aside from HTML  to writing what I thought were pretty complex solutions to a formatting problem  David became aware of the predicament at the Shakespeare Center while he was giving a presentation of his findings from an AIM project for the United Way  Wratchford happened to be in attendance  and she immediately began thinking of how the VMI program could help her outfit   She thought it was a really cool idea  said David   She was definitely excited about what quantitative thinking can do to make a place work better  And that is the purpose of AIM  So often  it is hard to visualize how higher math can be beneficial in real world situations  AIM takes care of that   It s about going out and getting real world problems from government  business   and  industry   and  bringing them back to have our VMI cadets solve them  said David   It s a good contrast from the classroom  added Cox  Did VMI s AIM program help  Wratchford seemed encouraged by the findings   We ve been very pleased  she said   They  helped  us get our vision wrapped around our patron and donor database  And the AIM team proved that maybe Shakespeare and mathematics do belong together  By Chris Floyd IR   Sept  2014 Natural Sciences Applied
