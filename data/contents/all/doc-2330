twins  all from the Richmond area  were among the 317 men and women who received diplomas from Virginia Military Institute on Friday  May 16  All six majored in either civil or mechanical engineering  Likewise  all six graduated from high schools in the Richmond area   and they all knew each other before they came to VMI  Noyan Erermis and Kaan Erermis  sons of Fikret Payaslioglu of Derbyshire Road  Richmond  graduated from Richmond s Douglas Freeman High School  Noyan Erermis  a runner  praised his high school coach  Brian Reutinger  for instilling in him a  never give up  work ethic that also served him well at VMI   You really wanted to do well for him  said Erermis of Reutinger   He was a really quiet guy  but at the same time he just knew you had it in you and you thought he believed in you so you didn t want to let him down    Coming into VMI  every time times got hard  I was thinking  do not give up  you ve made it through worse  After VMI  Noyan Erermis embarked on a cross country bicycle adventure  riding from Yorktown  Va  to Astoria  Ore  a journey of 4 200 miles  His twin  Kaan Erermis  also praised the mental and physical discipline of running at Douglas Freeman   The biggest thing I got out of it was the long distance running   it just made me mentally strong  that last lap of the race and every muscle in your body is telling you to stop   it carries over into anything that is mentally difficult in life  he said  Drawn to the outdoors like his brother  Kaan Erermis has taken a job with Papa Bear Adventures  guiding hunters and fly fishermen on trips to remote areas of Alaska  Jonathan and Matthew Reardon graduated from Benedictine College Preparatory School in Richmond  a military  Catholic  and all male school  They are the sons of Mr  and Mrs  Kevin P  Reardon of Rockville  Both Reardon twins said that Benedictine provided them with a strong academic foundation   The education at our school was really good  said Jonathan Reardon   I thought it was really high quality  It helped me come here and be successful  and it helped me find the way I wanted to go    I really looked up to my math and physics teacher  While at VMI  Jonathan Reardon earned Institute Honors and maintained a 4 0 grade point average  At graduation  he received the First Jackson Hope Medal for highest attainment in scholarship  accompanied by the Commander Harry Millard Mason Academic Proficiency Award  He plans to study aerospace engineering at Virginia Tech this fall  His twin  Matthew Reardon  also praised Benedictine   The teachers helped me out a lot because it was small classes as well  he said  After VMI  Matthew Reardon plans to study structural engineering at the University of Virginia  Jesse and Joshua Wells  sons of the Rev  and Mrs  Mark T  Wells of Midlothian  graduated from James River High School in Chesterfield County  Jesse Wells gave high marks to James River for both academics and athletics   Our coach  Mark Helberg  was one of the best coaches I ve ever been coached by  and I ve played sports since I was four years old  said Wells   He pushes you when you need to be pushed  Wells continued   Our math teachers in high school were some of our best teachers   they were the most engaging  That s why I decided to go into engineering  Upon graduating from VMI  Jesse Wells commissioned in the Air Force  He will report to Pensacola  Fla  for training as a navigator  Joshua Wells  like his brother  has fond memories of James River High School  where he played football and lacrosse  and also wrestled   Being a three sport athlete  we had three different groups of friends  he said   Each group in each different sport taught you different things   Wrestling showed us more that we needed to do something to push ourselves in college  After graduation  Joshua Wells returned to his native Midlothian to seek employment as a civil engineer  While at VMI  he completed an undergraduate research project on how to minimize shrinkage when drying concrete   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non
