have advised 42 undergraduates and high school students in applied and industrial mathematics projects with sponsors that include Calabzas Creek Research Inc   Department of Energy Contractor  Goodyear Tire and Rubber Corporation  Baekaert Steel Corporation  The National Institute of Health  Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory  The City of Lexington  and Valley Program for Aging Services  I would love to advise any project that involves mathematical modeling or optimizing physical problems including design and process management  I have designed many computational tools for industry  I have a lot of experience in statistics and data mining as well  Specific problems I have advised include  Designing a tool to optimize the production of steel wire  Building a data mining tool to predict the performance of tires before they are built  Optimizing the design of a power amplifier used in satellite applications  Creating software to optimally route meal delivery for the Valley Program for Aging Services  Building a data mining algorithm to predict HIV patient health under various treatment regiments  Creating a computational model to help the Navy determine the appropriate search patterns and asset usage to detect pirate activity  Meagan Herald  PhD   Mathematics  Some of my recent projects deal with immunology and studying respiratory infections with bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or determining what situations can cause inflammation even after a bacterial infection has been cleared  In the past I have worked with undergraduate students on many interdisciplinary projects in field such as  Immunology Studying Varicella zoster infections Working with Staphylococcus aureus infections Learning about calcium mediated T cell activation   Population studies Looking at the black bear population in Virginia and hunting regulations Understanding Zebra finch mating preferences   Environmental Issues Finding a quick way to determine the health of a stream Studying mercury bioaccumulation in songbirds along contaminated streams   I appreciate the mathematics that is found in seemly nonmathematical mundane activities  as the author Roald Dahl once stated  the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places  Lee Dewald  PhD   Operations Research   Geoff Cox  PhD   Mathematics During my graduate studies I was involved in the mechanical modeling of nano sized biological structures called vesicles  Recently  I have started working on an ecological model that determines the diet of a particular animal by analyzing the isotope levels in a tissue sample  In the summer of 2012  I advised an AIM project that used energy data from the City of Lexington to create an end user application that monitors energy consumption  Many real worlds skills are gained from AIM projects such as this  including  Programming Application Development Data Management  Visualization and Analysis Energy Sustainability
