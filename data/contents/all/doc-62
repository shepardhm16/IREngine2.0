English Major The mission of the English major at VMI is to prepare the citizen soldier for civic and professional life through disciplined engagement with rhetorical traditions and applications  from the classical to the contemporary  Grounded in a common interest in the varied functions of language  the major integrates multiple disciplinary approaches  including the literary  the philosophical  and the aesthetic  Cadets  command of language is developed both critically and creatively through the study of a range of humanistic works and practice in effective forms of expression  Rhetoric is both an art and a skill in using language  a means of fostering cooperation among human beings In this definition  language  encompasses the language of music  art  and philosophy as well as of writing and literature  Through a study of these languages  cadets learn to create and interpret a variety of texts and locate them in their cultural contexts  In the process English majors discover how authors  artists  and philosophers have shaped and been shaped by the values  beliefs  time  and place in which they lived and worked  Cadets thus gain a cultural awareness that will serve them well in today s global society  Given the necessity of digital communication in the twenty first century  they also learn how to navigate networked writing spaces and to develop multimedia projects for the web  To extend their education beyond the classroom and prepare them to be engaged citizens and professionals  they apply what they have learned to real world situations in both courses and required internships  To facilitate English majors  active engagement in their learning  classes in this department are kept small and individual mentoring is emphasized  Students therefore have ample opportunities to pursue individual projects in subjects of their own choosing  and those with particularly strong records are invited to undertake an Honors project in English  Sigma Tau Delta  the
