EE455  Electrical   Mechanical Design Home Teaching EE115 EE223 EE230 EE431 EE455 EE491 2 Engineering in practice often employs a hybrid of electrical and mechanical design skills  This laboratory intensive course takes students already proficient in analog design and microcontroller programming  and in the first module ties these skills together with microcontroller analog interfacing methods  The second module consists of a brief treatment of statics and continuum mechanics  and then introduces three dimensional solid modeling  additive rapid prototyping  and stress analysis techniques  Students then demonstrate mastery of electrical and mechanical design skills in the third module design project  Laboratory experiments involving microcontroller interfacing and computer aided design complement the lectures  Elective course  Prerequisite  EE223  EE339  PY208  Lecture Schedule In the following table  the readings and homework are assigned on the day listed and due on the following lesson  The readings are taken from the custom printed class textbook unless otherwise noted    Date Title Module 1  Project Management 1 13 Jan Course administration  Syllabus Lab 1 14   2 19   3 20   Lab 2 21 Client Meeting  1 Graded Review  1 4 26   5 27   Lab 3 28 Client Meeting  2 Graded Review  2 Module 2  Microcontrollers 6 2 Feb   7 3   Lab 4 4   8 9   9 10   Lab 5 11 Graded Review  3 10 16   11 17   Lab 6 18   12 23   13 24   Lab 7 25 Graded Review  4 Module 3  Solid Modeling 14 1 Mar   15 2   Lab 8 3   16 9   Lab 9 10 Graded Review  5 17 15 poor attendance Lab 10 16 Ac Thur   poor attendance Module 4  Project Management 18 29   19 30   Lab 11 31 Graded Review  6 20 7 Apr   21 12   22 13   Lab 12 14 Field trip to Dr  English s lab at Western New England University and Graded Review  7  Leave VMI 0700 on Friday  15 April  23 19 Lab cleanup  reorder parts 24 20 Intellectual property Lab 13 21 Intellectual property 25 26 Administration 26 27 27 Apr   May 4 Class DNF   Comp Time Documents Graded Review  Complete these and email to me by midnight before the day of the graded review  Timeline  The timeline will need to be updated at each graded review if milestone dates change  Parts Order Form  Example of parts order form  Be sure to check that your parts are in stock  Peer Review  At midterms and again at the end of the course you ll have a chance to rate your classmates work ethic
