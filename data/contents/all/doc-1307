This report was submitted to the Governor Henry Wise by VMI s Superintendent  Francis H  Smith  It is dated 1860 January 16  More about this topic  Full text  As soon as I heard of the invasion of our rights and territory  by the gang of marauders headed by John Brown  I deemed it my duty as well as privilege to tender the services of the officers and cadets to the governor  for any duty to which he might think proper to assign them  Accordingly  I was ordered by his Excellency Governor Wise to proceed to Charles Town with an artillery detachment of 80 cadets  serving with howitzers  Taking with me on my personal staff  Major J  T  L  Preston  acting quartermaster  Major R  E  Colston  acting adjutant  Surgeon E  L  Graham and Commissary J  T  Gibbs  I detailed 64 cadets to served as

detachment  and Lieut  D  Trueheart the artillery detachment  The command reached Charles Town on the 26th of November  and remained on duty there until they were relieved on the 6th December  In pursuance of orders received from the governor  the command returned to Lexington  by the way of Richmond  and I was afforded the privilege of presenting them to the governor  in the presence of the general assembly  It gives me great pleasure to report  that the novel duty thus assigned to the corps of cadets  although at times involving much exposure and hardship  was discharged with an alacrity and fidelity which reflected the highest credit upon them  and won from all observers the plaudits of approval  I am pleased to add that my command returned to their regular duty on the 10th December without the slightest accident  or without a single case of serious sickness  It has afforded me much gratification to know that the service thus discharged on the part of the institution was in perfect harmony with the wishes of the parents and friends of those who accompanied the detachment  One widowed mother  who had three sons under my command  thus wrote to them   My dear boys  only think of your being in camp  preparing for war    and civil war too  And yet I would not have you back  even if I could  I would not have one of my sons to be recreant to their state in this her hour

The Execution of John Brown Francis Smith Report  About this document  This report was submitted to the Governor Henry Wise by VMI s Superintendent  Francis H  Smith  It is dated 1860 January 16  More about this topic  Full text  As soon as I heard of the invasion of our rights and territory  by the gang of marauders headed by John Brown  I deemed it my duty as well as privilege to tender the services of the officers and cadets to the governor  for any duty to which he might think proper to assign them  Accordingly  I was ordered by his Excellency Governor Wise to proceed to Charles Town with an artillery detachment of 80 cadets  serving with howitzers  Taking with me on my personal staff  Major J  T  L  Preston  acting quartermaster  Major R  E  Colston  acting adjutant  Surgeon E  L  Graham and Commissary J  T  Gibbs  I detailed 64 cadets to served as infantry under the command of Major Wm  Gilham and 21 cadets with two howitzers  under the command of Major T  J  Jackson Lieuts  J  McCausland  H  Otey  and S Shipp accompanied the infantry detachment  and Lieut  D  Trueheart the artillery detachment  The command reached Charles Town on the 26th of November  and remained on duty there until they were relieved on the 6th December  In pursuance of orders received from the governor  the command returned to Lexington  by the way of Richmond  and I was afforded the privilege of presenting them to the governor  in the presence of the general assembly  It gives me great pleasure to report  that the novel duty thus assigned to the corps of cadets  although at times involving much exposure and hardship  was discharged with an alacrity and fidelity which reflected the highest credit upon them  and won from all observers the plaudits of approval  I am pleased to add that my command returned to their regular duty on the 10th December without the slightest accident  or without a single case of serious sickness  It has afforded me much gratification to know that the service
