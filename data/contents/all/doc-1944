System Standard Operations Procedure Print Friendly Page The VMI Honor Code Work for Grade Policy Procedures  Special Board of Inquiry   The purpose of this document is to set forth the procedures for the administration of the VMI Honor System during the VMI Summer Session  The VMI Honor Code The Honor Code is the daily application of the principles of ethics  honesty  and personal integrity by each student  cadet  to the problems with which he she is confronted  It pervades every activity of life personal  academic  athletic  and military and presents a rigid standard by which all students  cadets  must live  Because the Code is such an integral part of the life of each student  cadet  its very existence depends on the vigilance of every student  cadet  at VMI  Therefore  every reasonable suspicion of a violation of the Code must be reported immediately  A student who has knowledge of a breach of the Honor Code  and who does not report the same  is himself herself guilty of a violation of the Honor Code  Reporting breaches of the Code  The keystone of the VMI Honor Code is the fact that each student  cadet  is honor bound to report to the Honor Court any breach or reasonable suspicion of a breach of the Honor Code that comes under his her observation or is in any way brought to his her attention  Breaches involving students  cadets  taking summer courses at VMI must be reported to the Director of the Summer Session and to no other person  Breaches involving students  cadets  taking courses in Foreign Study Programs sponsored by the Summer Session must be reported to the Resident Program Director and to no other person  Administration of the Honor Code  it is inconsistent with a code of personal honor for there to be exhaustive written rules as the sole basis of determining honorable conduct  Hence  there are but few absolute rules for the administration of the Honor System  Definition of the terms  Certified  and  Official Statement  Certified  When applicable to a student s  cadet s  act or written or oral statement or report  the term  certified  means that his her statement is true to the best of his her information and belief in every significant particular  Official Statement  Means a written or oral statement made by a student  cadet  to another student  cadet  or an officer of the Institute who receives the statement in the course of acting in an official capacity  All official statements are certified  Work for Grade Policy Development of the spirit as well as the skills of academic inquiry is central to the mission of VMI s Academic Program  As a community of scholars  posing questions and seeking answers  we invariably consult and build upon the ideas  discoveries  and products of other who have wrestled with related issues and problems before us  We are obligated ethically and in many instances legally to acknowledge the sources of borrowed material that we use in our own work  This is the case whether we find that material in conventional resources  such as the library or cyberspace  or discover it in other places like conversations with our peers  Academic integrity requires the full and proper documentation of any material that is not original with us  It is therefore a matter of honor  To misrepresent someone else s works  ideas  images  data  or other intellectual property as one s own is stealing lying  and cheating all at once  Because the offense of improper or incomplete documentation is so serious  and the consequences so potentially grave  the following policies regarding work for grade have been adopted as a guide to students  cadets  and faculty in upholding the Honor Code under which all students  cadets  live  Work for Grade  The term  work for grade  is defined as any work presented to an instructor for a formal grade or undertaken in satisfaction of a requirement for successful completion of a course or degree requirement  Student s  Cadet s  Own Work  The term  student s  cadet s  own work  means that the student has composed the work from his her general accumulation of knowledge and skill except as clearly and fully documented and that it has been composed especially for the current assignment  No work previously submitted in any course at VMI or elsewhere will be resubmitted or reformatted for submission in a current course without the specific approval of the instructor  In all work for grade  failure to distinguish between the student s  cadet s  own work and ideas and the work and ideas of others is known as plagiarism  Proper documentation clearly and fully identifies the sources of all borrowed ideas  quotations  or other assistance  The student  cadet  is referred to the VMI authorized handbook for rules concerning quotations  paraphrases  and documents  In all written work for grade  the student  cadet  must include the words  HELP RECEIVED  conspicuously on the document  and he or she must then do one of two things   1  state  none  meaning that no help was received except as documented in the work  or  2  explain in detail the nature of the help received  In oral work for grade  the student  cadet  must make the same declaration before beginning the presentation  Admission of help received may result in a lower grade  but will not result in prosecution for an honor violation  Students  cadets  are prohibited from discussing the contents of a quiz exam until it is returned to them or final grades are posted  This enjoinder does not imply that any inadvertent expression or behavior that might indicate an individual s feeling about the test should be considered a breach of the certification  The real issue is whether students  cadets  received information  not available to everyone else in the class  which would give them an unfair advantage  If an individual inadvertently gives or receives information  the incident must be reported to the class instructor and to the Director of the Summer Session  Every student  cadet  bears the responsibility for familiarizing himself herself thoroughly with the policies stated in this section  with any supplementary statement posted by the academic department offering a course he or she taking  and with any special conditions provided in writing by the professor for a given assignment  If there is any doubt or uncertainty about the correct interpretation of a policy  the student  cadet  should consult the instructor of the course  There should be no confusion  however  on the basic principle that it is never acceptable to submit someone else s work  written or otherwise  formally graded or not  as one s own  The violation by a student  cadet  of any of these policies will  if he he she is found guilty  result in his her being dismissed from VMI  Neither ignorance nor professed confusion about the correct interpretation of these policies is an excuse  Procedures  Special Board of Inquiry A faculty member who discovers an apparent violation of the honor code will report the violation to their department head  The department head will decide whether the collected evidence justifies referral to the Director of the Summer Session  If the department head decides that the evidence does not justify referral  then he or she will conclude the investigation  Otherwise  the department head will submit a written report to the Director of the Summer Session  The report must contain both a recommendation for action and all relevant documents  including a statement signed by the faculty member who reported the violation  If the department head is absent  the faculty member should report directly to the Director of the Summer Session  Students should report all suspected honor violations to the Director of the VMI Summer Session or  in the case of students studying abroad to the Resident Program Director  The Director of the VMI Summer Session or Resident Program Director  with assistance as necessary  conducts a preliminary investigation and reports his preliminary findings in writing through the Dean to the Superintendent  The report to the Superintendent will have the evidence attached  If a Special Board of Inquiry is recommended  proposed charge s  and specification s  are included in the report  If the Superintendent believes that the matter should go forward  then he or his representative will have a charge sheet prepared  setting forth the charge s  and specification s  and listing the witnesses against the accused  Appended to the charge sheet will be a copy of all available evidence including written statements of the faculty member or student who discovered the apparent violation and the report of the Director of the VMI Summer Session or Resident Program Director  The accused  along with a member of the faculty or staff  preferably his her academic advisor  is brought before the Superintendent or his representative to be officially charged with a violation of the VMI Honor Code  At this time the accused is informed of his her rights and presented with charge s  and specification s  the list of witnesses  and a copy of all available evidence  The accused is encouraged to contact his her parents or guardian in the presence of his her faculty or staff advocate  After reviewing the evidence and conferring with parents and the advisor  the accused must inform the Superintendent or his representative of his her intent to have the case heard or admit guilt  If a hearing is requested  the date for the hearing is established at this time  An admission of guilt results in immediate dismissal from VMI  If the accused decides to have the case heard  the Superintendent appoints a Special Board of Inquiry by special order  In selecting members of the Board  the Superintendent or his representative uses a list of available faculty and staff members submitted to him by the Director of the Summer Session  No member of a department in which an alleged violation occurred is eligible  Student members are selected from the current Summer Session roster at random  The Board of Inquiry consists of 3 faculty staff members  one of whom is appointed President of the Board  2 cadets  a faculty staff prosecutor  and a recorder from the faculty or staff who has no vote  The purpose of the Board is to determine the true facts and report findings and recommendations to the Superintendent  Questions related to procedural issues or admissibility of evidence should be directed to the Superintendent s Representative to the Honor Court  The accused and his her counsel are given sufficient time to prepare a defense  The Board of Inquiry is convened  Using the Board of Inquiry Hearing Procedures as a guide  the President of the Board conducts the proceedings in which all facts are presented to and explored by the Board  Witnesses are presented by the Prosecution and by the Defense for questioning  These witnesses may attest to the character of the accused or they may have knowledge of the event or of the circumstances surrounding it  The Board is under no restriction as to who may appear before it  The sequence for the hearing follows  The case against the student  Prosecution  The case for the student  Defense  Any additional questions  Rebuttal and Board Questions  Review of important points pro and con  closing arguments and deliberations  After closing arguments  the Board begins deliberations  When each Board member has come to a decision as to the guilt or innocence of the accused  a vote is taken on each specification  Two not guilty votes result in an acquittal  Upon completion of the Board s proceedings  a written report containing the essential facts in the case  together with all evidence and the recommendation of the Board  will be sent to the Superintendent for action  At the request of the Superintendent  the Prosecutor and President are present to discuss the outcome of the Special Board of Inquiry during the Superintendent s review process  The Superintendent informs the accused of his final decision upon completion of his review  Foreign Study Programs  Cadets students involved in foreign study programs sponsored by the VMI Summer Session are subject to the VMI Honor Code  Suspected violations should be reported to the Resident Program Director  The Resident Program Director conducts an investigation and forwards all evidence to the Superintendent through the Director of the VMI Summer Session in accordance with the procedures found in paragraph 2 above  If the Superintendent believes that the matter should go forward  then a charge sheet will be prepared in accordance with the procedures found in paragraph 3 above and the accused is brought before the Resident Program Director to be officially charged with a violation of the VMI Honor Code in accordance with the procedures found in paragraph 4 above  The accused cadet student will be permitted to remain in the program  but a grade of  I  will be assigned for all of his her courses  A Board of Inquiry will be convened upon the accused cadet s student s return to VMI  If acquitted  the cadet student will receive a grade and credit for the course  If convicted  he she will not receive credit for the course and  in the case of a VMI cadet  will be dismissed from VMI    Back to Top   Print Friendly Page   All catalogues
