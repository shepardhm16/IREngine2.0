2015 Mr  Farrell  Mr  Ramsey  Members of the VMI Board of Visitors  Members of the Academic Board  Faculty and Staff  families and friends of today s graduating cadets  and member of the Corps of Cadets  Welcome to this Commencement Ceremony the climax of four years of diligent study and hard work by the Class of 2015  I have the great pleasure as we begin this morning s ceremony to welcome Mr  Thomas F  Farrell  II  He will be  formally  introduced in a few moments by the First Class President  however  I want to take this opportunity to extend my personal welcome to him and his family and express  on the part of the entire VMI community  our sincere appreciation for being with us today  I would especially like to commend him for setting an example for us and others of what an individual can accomplish in a number of wide ranging fields  Not only is he the highly successful leader of a major corporation that is essential to the day to day lives of all Virginians  he has also contributed his time and leadership to many civic and cultural organizations  and   most recently   he co authored and produced the feature motion picture Field of Lost Shoes that dramatizes the events  151 years ago  that took place at New Market  Mr  Farrell  we all look forward to your remarks this morning and we welcome you to VMI  Graduation from VMI is a great personal achievement  but it is an achievement that cannot be reached alone  Many others have contributed to the success of today s graduates  parents and grandparents  guardians  brothers and sisters  friends  Brother Rats  faculty  staff  coaches  and host families  to name but a few  VMI is  particularly  grateful to parents and grandparents for encouraging and sustaining their sons and daughters  grandsons and granddaughters  throughout these cadet years  May I ask parents   grandparents to please stand and receive our thanks and are there great grandparents present  would you please stand  This is certainly a proud day for all of you  Universities and colleges are many things to many people  but at heart of any great institution of higher education is its Faculty  They are the ones who teach  guide  counsel  and encourage young people on a day to day basis  I include in this group our military staff and those who coach our athletes  for at VMI we believe that the academic and physical aspects make for a  full and complete  education  Please join me in expressing thanks to the Institute s faculty  The Class of 2015 matriculated in August 2011 with a strength of 509   and today will graduate 297 cadets  Adding graduates from other classes  today s ceremony will see 321 cross the stage  By the end of this summer  a total of 158 members of the Class of 2015  53  are projected to be commissioned in the Armed Forces  Some took their commissioning oath yesterday and received the rank of second lieutenant or ensign  others will soon be commissioned upon completion of summer training or the Officer Candidate School  OCS  program  Those numbers are especially commendable and reinforce VMI s historic mission of producing Citizen Soldiers  Many VMI cadets  staff  and faculty have been called to active duty in support of the current war on terror  thus placing their lives and cadetships temporarily on hold  In addition  there are parents and family members and others in the audience this morning who have served  Would you  patriots  please stand and receive our appreciation for your service  I want to thank the Class of 2015 for your leadership over the four years of your cadetship  and especially for your work as First Classmen  This year you trained and dyked a matriculating class of 500 New Cadets  You conducted a superb Ratline  strengthened the Class System  led a successful  Breakout  and set the example for the other classes  I congratulate you on your important academic achievements  scholar athletes  leaders nationally in undergraduate research  impressive graduate school attendance  impressive Commissioning awards  and a large number of top tier academic awards  These accomplishments add to the luster of your class and to the reputation of the Institute  Your class is proud of the accomplishments you made as a class  but you are especially proud of the accomplishments of individual members of your class  They include stories of amazing resilience  compassion  camaraderie  success  failure  and the ability to come back from failure and tragedy  This is what makes the class of 2015 unique  the  individual  actions of young men and women that describe and define the character of this class  whose destiny I believe is bright  service filled  and bound for success  The Class of 2015 has another distinction  it is was present in the year that marked the 175th anniversary of the founding of the Institute  the 150th anniversary of the Battle of New Market  and the 100th anniversary of the beginning of the First World War  in which 1 800 VMI alumni served  VMI is a forward looking institution  dedicated to producing intelligent and useful citizens  but it is also steeped in history  We march into the future  but we are ever mindful of the rich legacy of our past and the strength that gives us  Today s ceremony represents a look backward and a look forward  In fact  the two terms used for this ceremony   graduation and commencement   reflect these two meanings  It is the culmination of four years of hard work and dedication to a goal  and it is the beginning of putting those lessons and goals to work in careers that will be satisfying to yourself and useful to the broader community  Today  in fact  represents a passage from preparation to fulfillment  Such turning points come rarely in one s life   so grasp its potential and hold yourself ever open to its many possibilities  Just by selecting VMI as your pathway to the future reveals your determination  your resolve  All higher education is demanding and challenging  but a VMI education tests you on all levels  You have met the test  your individual resolve has paid off  And I congratulate you  Individual initiative and individual accomplishment are essential to success  but we must always recognize that success is not and never will be exclusively a matter of individual resolve  You have succeeded because of your determination  but you have also been helped  supported  encouraged  and assisted by family  friends  Brother Rats  faculty members and coaches  You have succeeded within a very special community  As you move forward with your lives  build on your individuality and what makes you distinctive  but also remember the importance of community and your role within it  Community provides the environment  structure  and systems in which it is possible to be  what you resolve to be  Hold onto the concept of honor that is the foundation stone   the very bedrock   of VMI  Seek ways to serve your community and your nation as citizen leaders  Use your talents to their utmost  and strive to develop new talents  new knowledge  and new directions  People will hold you to a higher standard because you are a VMI graduate  This high expectation cannot be avoided  it comes with the ring and the diploma  Embrace it as the heritage that has been passed on to you by former graduating classes  and strive always to preserve and enhance it  As you receive your diploma today we offer warmest  congratulations  Performance and achievement  well done  Press on   the open road awaits you  Godspeed  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
