Photo by John Robertson  The 500 seat Gillis Theater on the VMI post was filled to capacity with high school and college students and teachers from across the nation as VMI s second biennial Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  opened today  The conference will continue tomorrow when the current generation of students takes the lead in discussing and presenting strategies for encouraging academic and personal integrity  LEXINGTON  Va  March 5  2012   Who cheats  Anybody  Everybody  Cheating occurs among males and females  among all age groups  among low and high achievers  among students and corporate leaders  among major league athletes and ordinary taxpayers  among bankers  journalists  and employees in any workplace where there is something to steal  So said opening session speakers Dr  Eric M  Anderman and Dr  David Callahan in VMI s Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities   When I became a teacher  I was absolutely floored by how many of my students cheated  said Anderman  looking back on his time as a middle and high school teacher  a graduate teaching assistant  and professor at The Ohio State University   The amount of cheating we see at our university boggles the mind   This conference could not be more timely  and it couldn t be more important  said Callahan  author of The Cheating Culture  Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead   The epidemic of cheating in our high schools and our colleges is unacceptable  It undermines the basic idea of meritocracy  of the level playing field     Cheating doesn t just undermine education  he added   It undermines America and what this country is all about  But though cheating is prevalent across American society and American schools  Anderman s research has identified factors that influence cheating  making it more or less common in various environments   When people cheat  they make a decision  he said  a decision based mainly on three issues  their own goals  their confidence in their ability to do well without cheating  and the costs associated with cheating  Studies show that males cheat more than females and that more cheating occurs in science  math  business  and engineering classes than in humanities and social science classes  Studies show that older students cheat more than younger students and that low achievers cheat more than high achievers  But more important than any of these factors  said Anderman  is whether or not cheaters are likely to get caught  An estimated 90 percent of all cheaters don t   This is a huge thing that figures into the decision making process  said Anderman  That element of the cultural environment  whether or not cheating is tolerated  is key  Also key is whether the teaching environment emphasizes mastery or grades  For students  wherever grades are emphasized over mastery  cheating increases  A similar emphasis exerts a similar influence in the work environment for teachers   High stakes testing is a tremendous force in teachers  lives  said Anderman  noting cheating scandals in Chicago and Georgia in which teachers were suspected of helping their students cheat  The repercussions of failed standardized tests at the state and federal level are perceived by many school teachers to be dire  While Anderman explained the particulars of who cheats and how and why  Callahan cast cheating in schools in the broader context of an overall ethics crisis   Here is what I know about the state of ethics in America  We have problems  big problems  It s not just our college campuses where people cheat  not by a long shot  he said  pointing up instances of unethical behavior by doctors  lawyers  accountants  athletes  and journalists that have made the news in the 10 years he has been studying the issue   Many Americans cheat on their taxes   tax evasion costs over  300 billion a year    Theft at the workplace  embezzlement  is actually the most costly form of crime in the United States     And  a great many ordinary Americans engage in insurance fraud  At the same time  noted Callahan  crime rates  including murder  rape  and robbery  have been falling  as have teen homicide  drunk driving  and alcohol and cigarette use rates   In many ways  we are in a period of moral renewal  said Callahan  adding that people seem to be using a different moral compass regarding money and economic security   We live in an era with pervasive economic anxiety    There s a lot of status anxiety and envy in America    The rational incentives to cheat have never been greater than they are today  Callahan said that young people are internalizing anxieties about economic security and are able to rationalize cheating because they believe it s common  They watch the news too  after all   There s a pretty remarkable level of cynicism among America s young people  said Callahan    Identifying these key elements that influence cheating can be a step toward a solution  The conference itself  said Callahan  is another one   We are standing up  and we are saying enough  enough already  he said   We re not just part of a conference here  we re part of a movement  a movement that may still be small  but a movement that with time and work can reduce cheating in our high schools and colleges  In addition to changing the environment of teaching to emphasize mastery  educators need to change the environment of learning to include enforcement   Academic integrity is simply not the highest priority in education today  said Callahan   That has got to change  In every area where cheating has become epidemic  we find sleeping watchdogs  It s just rational  People cheat more when they think they can get away with it  The movement starts with this conference   We can change that calculus  concluded Callahan   We are stronger together  with more ideas and solutions   We can have a huge impact   Sherri Tombarge  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families
