applicant s status may be classified under several different categories as it moves through the process  They include  Inquiry  Students in this category have been added to the database from many sources  In most cases we do not have much information about the academic profile of these students or a measure of their interest in VMI  They have been added to the inquiry pool from sources such as college fairs  direct mail responses  recommendations from alumni etc  Incomplete  A student in this category has submitted an application but there is at least one piece of the application package that is not yet complete  i e  no transcript  no counselor recommendation form  no application fee  no SAT ACT score etc  Upon receipt of the application package the admissions office notifies the student indicating the information received as well as what additional material is required  Complete  The application is complete but a decision by the admissions staff has not yet been made  Appointed  Students in this category have submitted all the necessary application materials and have been offered admission  They will be notified of their appointment by mail with an official certificate  In addition they will be informed of the date by which they must indicate their intent to accept or decline the offer of appointment and what they must do to begin the reservation process  All appointments are  conditional  meaning that the student must meet all medical requirements and successfully complete their current academic program  Deferred  Students in this category do not currently have the academic credentials to be competitive for admission but their overall record indicates potential  They are informed of what they must do for their application to receive further consideration  In most cases this means they must submit additional SAT ACT scores or additional course grades  Applicants in this category are often told they will not be notified of a final decision on their application until after 1 April  Turn Down  Students in this category have made application but do not have the academic credentials worthy of an offer of appointment  They are informed by mail of our decision and no further action is taken on their application  Waiting List  Students in this category have not been offered appointment  but have not been turned down  Some aspect of the student s academic record indicates potential but they are in the lower tier of the applicant pool  They are informed that they have been placed on the waiting list and will be reevaluated at the end of the recruiting year  usually after 15 May  on a space available basis  To be considered from the wait list they must continue to update the admissions office with grades and in some cases additional SAT ACT scores  Partial Reservation  Students in this category have been offered appointment and have indicated their intent to matriculate by submitting the  300 00 reservation deposit  Once they complete and submit their medical forms  dental forms  and additional paperwork they will be classified as a complete reservation  Reservation  Students in this category have submitted all of the necessary deposits and paperwork  They have been approved for admission both academically and medically  This is the final step in the application process prior to matriculation  If the student has a medical  academic  or disciplinary problem between the completion of their reservation and matriculation VMI reserves the right to cancel their reservation and revoke their appointment  Canceled  Applicants in this category have been offered appointment but have decided not to enroll at VMI  Appointed applicants could be moved to this category after the appointment  partial  or even reservation stage  If they cancel after the 1 May deadline they do not receive a refund of their  300 00 reservation fee  TDSP  The Turn Down Special  TDSP  category is used in limited form for an applicant that is turned down for the current year but is planning to reapply for the following year after a year of post high school academic work  The office of Admissions remains in contact with the applicant and often assists them in selecting the courses they will take before reapplying  This is for applicants that have a strong interest in VMI and have had close contact with the admissions
