Alvarado  17   Alexander Alvarado  17 had always known he wanted to come to VMI   but he wouldn t be enrolled at the Institute today if it weren t for a generous financial aid package  The son of a self employed contractor  and a Rockbridge County resident since the age of 6  Alvarado was attracted to VMI by the discipline of the Rat Line and the strength of the Institute s engineering programs   He applied to VMI during his senior year at Rockbridge County High School and was accepted immediately  Finding the money to pay for his education seemed unlikely  though  until he received word that the entire cost of his first year would be paid for by private donations and a small government loan  When he applied for financial aid again  in the spring of his 4th Class year  he received a similarly generous package  including a gift from Lexington physician Dr  Robert Pickral  71   It s a miracle that I m here because that was really unexpected  said Alvarado  a civil engineering major   Without  financial aid  I wouldn t be here  There is no way I could have paid for this on my own  Alvarado spent his 4th Class year building up a solid grade point average of 3 36 and discovering
