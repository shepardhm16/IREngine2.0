never give out  in their quest to create a more just society  The award is presented by the VMI Board of Visitors in honor of Daniels  valedictorian of the VMI Class of 1961  who was killed while

son of Alabama sharecroppers reminded his audience that the need to get in  good trouble  necessary trouble  had driven him ever since a childhood vision of himself as a preacher had led him to preach to chickens in his family s backyard  As a young adult  Lewis went out of his way to meet the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  whom he described in a later meeting with cadets as an  older brother  Alongside King and other leaders of the civil rights movement  Lewis participated in the  Bloody Sunday  voting rights march on March 7  1965  during which he and many others were severely injured

him that little progress has been made toward racial equality in this country  he tells them   Come walk in my shoes    From someone who grew up preaching to chickens  to be able to stand near that bridge and introduce the first African American president to that multitude of people  I feel more than lucky  I feel blessed  But that sense of blessing didn t come without a bitter and heavy cost   The blood of Jonathan Daniels   helped to bring us to where we are today  said Lewis  who called Daniels  a seminarian at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge  Mass  at the time of his death   a

Jonathan Daniels   Got in the Way  to Make Things Better    To see the entire Daniels Award ceremony  and Rep  John Lewis  entire talk  visit http bit ly DanielsAward15  LEXINGTON  Va  March 11  2015   In remarks given after he accepted VMI s Jonathan M  Daniels  61 Humanitarian Award earlier today in Cameron Hall  Rep  John Lewis counseled the Corps of Cadets to  never give up  never give in  and never give out  in their quest to create a more just society  The award is presented by the VMI Board of Visitors in honor of Daniels  valedictorian of the VMI Class of 1961  who was killed while saving the life of African American teenager Ruby Sales during the violent struggle for civil rights in Alabama in 1965  This year marks the 50th anniversary of Daniels  death  Lewis  who has represented Georgia s 5th District in Congress since 1986  was honored with the award because of his commitment to social justice and deep ties to the civil rights movement  During his remarks  the son of Alabama sharecroppers reminded his audience that the need to get in  good trouble  necessary trouble  had driven him ever since a childhood vision of himself as a preacher had led him to preach to chickens in his family s backyard  As a young adult  Lewis went out of his way to meet the Rev  Martin Luther King Jr  whom he described in a later meeting with cadets as an  older brother  Alongside King and other leaders of the civil rights movement  Lewis participated in the  Bloody Sunday  voting rights march on March 7  1965  during which he and many others were severely injured when Alabama state troopers  some on horseback  attacked the unarmed protesters with billy clubs and tear gas as they crossed a bridge in Selma  Ala   I thought I was going to die on that bridge  said Lewis  who required a hospital stay to recover from the beating he received  Lewis also took the opportunity to put the Selma bridge incident in perspective  The congressman said that when people tell him that little progress has been made toward racial equality in this country  he tells them   Come walk in my shoes    From someone who grew up preaching to chickens  to be able to stand near that bridge and introduce the first African American president to that multitude of people  I feel more than lucky  I feel blessed  But that sense of blessing didn t come without a bitter and heavy cost   The blood of Jonathan Daniels   helped to bring us to where we are today  said Lewis  who called Daniels  a seminarian at Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge  Mass  at the time of his death   a beautiful spirit  a beautiful soul  Lewis likewise reminded his listeners that because of people like Daniels and others who stepped forward to make good and necessary trouble  the signs of segregation    White  and  Colored    which marked his childhood  have long since disappeared from the American landscape  Addressing the cadets in the audience  Lewis noted   Your children  my grandchildren will not see those signs  The only place you can see them is in a book  a museum  or a video  With his lifelong commitment to optimism  Lewis took the opportunity to look ahead and envision a world very much like the one King  his late mentor  had lived and died for   Let s do the best we can to create an America and a world community that s at peace with itself  Lewis exhorted his listeners   Lay down the burden of hate and the burden of separation  As he concluded his remarks  Lewis quoted the late A  Philip Randolph  organizer of the 1963 March on Washington  who often said   Maybe our forefathers and our foremothers all came to this great land in different ships  But we re all in the same boat now  Lewis  a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom  among other awards  is only the fourth individual to be honored with the Daniels Award since the honor was first presented in 2001  That year  former President Jimmy Carter became the inaugural recipient  In 2006  the award was presented to Andrew Young  former U S  ambassador to the United Nations  and in 2011  to Dr  Paul Hebert  68  an international humanitarian aid worker  In addition to the awards ceremony and speech by Lewis  other activities on post today in honor of Daniels included a wreath laying ceremony in the Daniels Courtyard and a special performance of Jonathan Myrick Daniels  the Martyr of Lowndes County by the VMI Theater  Among the many out of town guests attending today s events were a number of people from Alabama  A special guest at the awards ceremony was Richard Morrisroe  a Roman Catholic priest who was severely injured in the attack that killed Daniels   Mary Price    VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos
