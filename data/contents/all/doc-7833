well paid experiences and they often lead to post graduation job offers  In fact  many employers now use internships as a three month trial employment  and often hope to hire as many as 75 80  of their interns for full time positions  The current economic conditions made the search for 2010 internships more challenging than in past years  Many programs cut their internships completely or reduced their number of hires significantly  However  many of our cadets rose to the challenge and worked hard to find some excellent opportunities  The summer of 2010 will see EC BU cadets interning at Bloomberg Global Data  Owens   Minor  Woodward   Associates  Intelitap Inc  New Market Corporation  the U S  State Department  The London Company and Dynis Inc  among others  A number of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  Many of these opportunities were possible because of alumni connections and networking  If you think that you can help with future internship searches in any way  please be sure to contact our Internship Coordinator  Linda Moreschi  at moreschilp vmi edu  She will work with you to promote the job opportunity and identify cadet candidates  The workplace and life experiences that cadets enjoy during these summer internships are an invaluable part of their education
