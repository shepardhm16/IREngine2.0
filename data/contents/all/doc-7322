helped VMI obtain over  500 000 in extramural funding for academic programs  We know of at least one  and he s VMI s grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator  Lt  Cmdr  Mike Sebastino  Sebastino  a 1988 graduate of the Citadel  came to VMI in July 2003 as VMI s first ever grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator  Funded by a grant from the Jackson Hope Foundation  Sebastino was tasked with assisting faculty with obtaining extramural funding and in matters related to intellectual property  Since arriving here  he has been working with faculty members to develop the infrastructure to support an effective extramural funding program  as well as student faculty intellectual property pursuits  Recently  his efforts received their biggest payback thus far  as the National Endowment for the Humanities  NEH  announced that it had awarded VMI a Challenge Grant in the amount of  500 000 for an endowment to support the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis  Sebastino worked closely with Col  Malcolm  Kip  Muir  professor of history and director of the Adams Center  as well as the program officer at NEH to develop the winning proposal   Kip deserves most of the credit   it s his program  and he did a great job in conveying the importance of the center to the people at NEH  said Sebastino   I just provided Kip with as much support as possible  and handled the peripheral administrative tasks  so that he could concentrate his efforts on the  meat  of the proposal  Having someone who can reduce the administrative burden that comes with submitting most extramural proposals is something new to VMI  According to Sebastino   the paperwork and red tape can certainly be a deterrent to faculty in responding to funding solicitations  and that s a shame  because there are a lot of people at VMI doing high quality work that would be very competitive  In the year and a half since Sebastino has been working at VMI  he has noticed a steady increase in the amount of interest in extramural funding opportunities both in the humanities and in the sciences and engineering  He has assisted faculty members in submitting proposals in support of a wide variety of activities  such as the implementation of new teaching methods and courses  undergraduate research centers  and academic conferences and scientific research  He has also been working closely with Col  Dick Rowe  VMI s director of research and director of VMI Research Laboratories  to develop standardized procedures for faculty members to submit extramural funding proposals in order to ensure that proposals are not only appropriate for the Institute  but that they are of the highest quality and match the stated funding objectives of the potential sponsor  In addition to his work with grants and proposals  Sebastino has also been working on VMI s intellectual property policies and procedures  Intellectual property includes things like patents and copyrights that are created from research and other academic pursuits  Sebastino worked with a committee of VMI faculty and staff to develop a draft intellectual property that will enable VMI to support the intellectual property pursuits of its faculty and staff  and provide them with the potential to profit from successful inventions  In concert with this effort  he has been exploring various options to finance the activities required to obtain a patent  which generally costs around  10 000 to S15 000 per patent  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI

Office 210 Smith Hall Virginia Military Institute Lexington  VA 24450 Institute Report February 2005  How many Citadel graduates can say   or would admit   that they helped VMI obtain over  500 000 in extramural funding for academic programs  We know of at least one  and he s VMI s grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator  Lt  Cmdr  Mike Sebastino  Sebastino  a 1988 graduate of the Citadel  came to VMI in July 2003 as VMI s first ever grants  contracts and intellectual property administrator  Funded by a grant from the Jackson Hope Foundation  Sebastino was tasked with assisting faculty with obtaining extramural funding and in matters related to intellectual property  Since arriving here  he has been working with faculty members to develop the infrastructure to support an effective extramural funding program  as well as student faculty intellectual property pursuits  Recently  his efforts received their biggest payback thus far  as the National Endowment for the Humanities  NEH  announced that it had awarded VMI a Challenge Grant in the amount of  500 000 for an endowment to support the John A  Adams  71 Center for Military History and Strategic Analysis  Sebastino worked closely with Col  Malcolm  Kip  Muir  professor of history and director of the Adams Center  as well as the program officer at NEH to develop the winning proposal   Kip deserves most of the credit   it s his program  and he did a great job in conveying the importance of the center to the people at NEH  said Sebastino   I just provided Kip with as much support as possible  and handled the peripheral administrative tasks  so that he could concentrate his efforts on the  meat  of the proposal  Having someone who can reduce the administrative burden that comes with submitting most extramural proposals is something new to VMI  According to Sebastino   the paperwork and red tape can certainly be a deterrent to faculty in responding to funding solicitations  and that s a shame  because there are a lot of people at VMI doing high quality work that would be very competitive  In the year and a half since Sebastino has been working at VMI  he has noticed a steady increase in the amount of interest in extramural funding opportunities both in the humanities and in the sciences and engineering  He has assisted faculty members in submitting proposals in support of a wide variety of activities  such as the implementation of new teaching methods and courses  undergraduate research centers  and academic conferences and scientific research  He has also been working closely with Col  Dick Rowe  VMI s director of research and director of VMI Research Laboratories  to develop standardized procedures for faculty members to submit extramural funding proposals in order to ensure that proposals are not only appropriate for the Institute  but that they are of the highest quality and match the stated funding objectives of the potential sponsor  In addition to his work with grants and proposals  Sebastino has also been working on VMI s intellectual property policies and procedures  Intellectual property includes things like patents and copyrights that are created from research and other academic pursuits  Sebastino worked with a committee of VMI faculty and staff to develop a draft intellectual property that will enable VMI to support the intellectual property pursuits of its faculty and staff  and provide them with the potential to profit from successful inventions  In concert with this effort  he has been exploring various options to finance the activities required to obtain a patent  which generally costs around  10 000 to S15 000 per patent Academics Home Jackson Hope Fund Video Testimonies Jackson Hope Stories Initiatives Funding Process
