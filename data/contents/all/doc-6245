Undergraduate Research Project List Undergraduate Research Project List EE 493 01  Carbon Nanotube  CNT  Sensor Devices This interdisciplinary project is a collaborative effort between VMI ECE and the Roanoke College Physics Department  Early research will focus on the development of carbon nanotubes  and the design of electronic devices  C FETs  to be used in biological and chemical sensing  Future research will focus on the characterization of these devices  Occasional travel to Roanoke College is encouraged and will be supported  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructor   Addington Credits   TBD EE 493 02  Bioengineering This interdisciplinary project is a collaborative effort between VMI ECE and the Roanoke College Chemistry Department  Research will focus on the design and fabrication of miniaturized biosensor devices and packaging  Characterization of these devices  for specific biomedical applications  will also be investigated  Occasional travel to Roanoke College is encouraged and will be supported  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructors   Addington  Squire Credits   TBD EE 493 03  Design  Fabrication  and Characterization of Bipolar Junction Transistors In recent years  student members of the Microelectronics and Semiconductor Research Team have designed  fabricated  and characterized a number of electronic devices  including several types of field effect transistors  FETs  and digital logic gates  In this project  cadets will design  fabricate  and characterize the first bipolar junction transistors  BJTs  ever made at VMI using the ECE Semiconductor Device Laboratory facilities  At the beginning of their research  cadets will be trained on the proper use of computer aided design  CAD  tools  as well as all laboratory processing and testing equipment  Cadets will then have the opportunity to begin the development of their custom made devices  following the tradition of the ECE Semiconductor Device Laboratory  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructor   Addington Credits   TBD EE 493 04  Semiconductor Device Fabrication and Mathematical Device Modeling This interdisciplinary project is a collaborative effort between VMI ECE and the VMI Mathematics Department  Using the capabilities of the ECE Semiconductor Laboratory  cadets will first develop basic semiconductor devices  and then work with the VMI MA Dept  to develop accurate mathematical device models to be subsequently used in the refinement of device performance  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructor   Addington Credits   TBD EE 493 05  RFID The use of Radio Frequency Identification  RFID  technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in today s society   from gas pumps and package tracking to automobile entry and secure facility access  In this project  cadets will design and develop their own RFID devices  using the capabilities of the ECE Microelectronics Laboratory  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructor   Addington Credits   TBD EE 493 06  Optoelectronics As evidenced by preliminary work performed several years ago in the ECE Microelectronics Laboratory  the department has the capability to design and fabricate a variety of optoelectronic devices and packages  based on electroluminescence technologies  light emission upon electronic excitation  electric current or field  This project will provide cadets several opportunities to expand on these previous efforts  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructor   Addington Credits   TBD EE 493 07  Hall Effect Study The Hall Effect is a semiconductor phenomenon that permits the identification of semiconductor doping characteristics  type and concentration  Ongoing work in the ECE Semiconductor Laboratory has resulted in the development and characterization of several Hall Effect devices  This project will expand on these efforts  Interested cadets should contact COL Addington  addingtonjs vmi edu   prior to enrolling  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Instructor   Addington Credits   TBD EE 493 08  CMOS Technology Recent upgrades to the ECE Semiconductor Laboratory facilities now permits the realization of devices based on CMOS technology   the fundamental technology behind virtually all microprocessors  memory  etc  Cadets will design  fabricate  and characterize various NMOS  PMOS  and CMOS structures  At the beginning of their research  cadets will be trained on the proper use of computer aided design  CAD  tools  as well as all laboratory processing and testing equipment  Cadets will then have the opportunity to begin the development of their custom made devices  following the tradition of the ECE Semiconductor
