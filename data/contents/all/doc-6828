Outcomes Mission Statement  Objectives  and Outcomes  Mission Statement The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering educates cadets in a rigorous academic environment that nurtures the development of analytic and communications skills applied to the design of electrical and computer engineering hardware and software components and systems  striking a balance between a solid foundation in fundamental principles and practical applied experience  to produce graduates that are prepared for lifelong learning  that exhibit professional engineering practices  and are able to make significant contributions to their profession and society  Program Educational Objectives The Program Educational Objectives of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering are guided by the mission statement  are based on the needs of the department s constituencies  and outline  what graduates are expected to attain within a few years of graduation   ABET Criterion 2  These Program Educational Objectives are defined below  The department seeks to prepare graduates who  in a few years after graduation  have  Established themselves in  and made contributions to  a professional career in industry  government  or the military  and or are continuing their education in graduate school  Remained current in their profession through continuing education  via the completion of graduate coursework  attainment of certifications  or maintenance of active professional licensure  or through personal self study and or on the job training as part of their career advancement
