Preservation   Cadet Molly Western and Maj  Paul Moosman use radio transmitters to locate sleeping bats  VMI Photo by John Robertson IV The research continues  Professor s Research Looks to Save Species of Bats Three cadets worked this summer to preserve one of the smallest mammals in the world  the eastern small footed bat  The work took them out into the field at Sherando Lake and other sites  where they crossed the paths of black bears  flying squirrels  and rattlesnakes  The cadets  Molly Western  14  Zackary Hann  13  and Micah Hosler  14  each had a separate research focus  but they worked as a team to gather data and collect samples  The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service is studying the bats in response to a petition for classifying them as endangered  If that happens  a series of habitat protections and conservation efforts will be implemented   The problem is we don t know much about these bats  No one has done work on their ecology  so they can t protect them if they don t know what makes them tick  said Maj  Paul Moosman  98  assistant professor of biology   So that s what Molly Western s project is all about  She s studying where they re roosting as well as the differences in the biology between males and females  She s filling in this picture about what they re doing and what their habitat needs are  Hosler s research is filling in another aspect of bat ecology  He s using stable isotope analysis of bat fur to determine the diets of the eastern small footed bat and two other species   This is my passion  I care about the environment  and I enjoy learning about it  said Hosler   I love going out into the field and working alongside my team  Hann is studying the eastern red bat  another species about which little is known  The team of cadets ventured out at night to catch bats in nets set up in areas where bats hunt for insects  such as over streams or across trails   We go out just before dark  and that gives us about half an hour of sunlight to set up the nets  said Western   When we do catch a bat  we have to be really careful about not breaking their wings because they re so fragile  Eastern small footed bats are about the weight of a nickel and about the size of a person s thumb  eastern red bats are only twice that size  Once the bats were netted  the cadets collected fur samples and attached radio transmitters to relay information on the bat s body temperature and location  The team then went out in daylight to locate the sleeping bats and collect more data   It s like looking for a needle in a haystack  said Western   There are thousands of rocks  and you re looking for one tiny little bat in a tiny little crevice  Once they found the bats  roosts they measured the location  size  and temperature of the roosts in order to figure out what kind of habitat the bats require  including the roosting requirements of mother bats  which congregate into maternity roosts to conserve energy  All this information will be built into the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries  dataset on the species  which will contribute to the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service s decision on whether or not to list the bats as endangered   We re spread fairly thin  so it s really a good fit for us to work with people like Paul and his students  said Rick Reynolds  VDGIF wildlife biologist   It always ends up being a personnel numbers game to get enough people out there to study these populations  Although fur samples were collected during this summer s research  Hosler s lab analysis of bat fur focused on a larger sample of fur from New Hampshire   As long as their hair is growing  you can see what the bats are eating  said Hosler   Bats control insect populations  so by studying what they re eating we can get support behind preserving these species  This line of research is likely to provide exciting opportunities for years to come  since many more local samples must to be collected in order to draw definite conclusions   The work is pretty exciting  they ve been seeing snakes and bears  said Moosman   It s eye opening  A lot of cadets have a love of nature begin with  but a lot of them don t have an idea of how exciting this aspect of biology is  with all the field work and conservation opportunities  That excitement was echoed by all the cadets studying bats in the field   I really

Support Preservation   Cadet Molly Western and Maj  Paul Moosman use radio transmitters to locate sleeping bats  VMI Photo by John Robertson IV The research continues  Professor s Research Looks to Save Species of Bats Three cadets worked this summer to preserve one of the smallest mammals in the world  the eastern small footed bat  The work took them out into the field at Sherando Lake and other sites  where they crossed the paths of black bears  flying squirrels  and rattlesnakes  The cadets  Molly Western  14  Zackary Hann  13  and Micah Hosler  14  each had a separate research focus  but they worked as a team to gather data and collect samples  The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service is studying the bats in response to a petition for classifying them as endangered  If that happens  a series of habitat protections and conservation efforts will be implemented   The problem is we don t know much about these bats  No one has done work on their ecology  so they can t protect them if they don t know what makes them tick  said Maj  Paul Moosman  98  assistant professor of biology   So that s what Molly Western s project is all about  She s studying where they re roosting as well as the differences in the biology between males and females  She s filling in this picture about what they re doing and what their habitat needs are  Hosler s research is filling in another aspect of bat ecology  He s using stable isotope analysis of bat fur to determine the diets of the eastern small footed bat and two other species   This is my passion  I care about the environment  and I enjoy learning about it  said Hosler   I love going out into the field and working alongside my team  Hann is studying the eastern red bat  another species about which little is known  The team of cadets ventured out at night to catch bats in nets set up in areas where bats hunt for insects  such as over streams or across trails   We go out just before dark  and that gives us about half an hour of sunlight to set up the nets  said Western   When we do catch a bat  we have to be really careful about not breaking their wings because they re so fragile  Eastern small footed bats are about the weight of a nickel and about the size of a person s thumb  eastern red bats are only twice that size  Once the bats were netted  the cadets collected fur samples and attached radio transmitters to relay information on the bat s body temperature and location  The team then went out in daylight to locate the sleeping bats and collect more data   It s like looking for a needle in a haystack  said Western   There are thousands of rocks  and you re looking for one tiny little bat in a tiny little crevice  Once they found the bats  roosts they measured the location  size  and temperature of the roosts in order to figure out what kind of habitat the bats require  including the roosting requirements of mother bats  which congregate into maternity roosts to conserve energy  All this information will be built into the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries  dataset on the species  which will contribute to the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service s decision on whether or not to list the bats as endangered   We re spread fairly thin  so it s really a good fit for us to work with people like Paul and his students  said Rick Reynolds  VDGIF wildlife biologist   It always ends up being a personnel numbers game to get enough people out there to study these populations  Although fur samples were collected during this summer s research  Hosler s lab analysis of bat fur focused on a larger sample of fur from New Hampshire   As long as their hair is growing  you can see what the bats are eating  said Hosler   Bats control insect populations  so by studying what they re eating we can get support behind preserving these species  This line of research is likely to provide exciting opportunities for years to come  since many more local samples must to be collected in order to draw definite conclusions   The work is pretty exciting  they ve been seeing snakes and bears  said Moosman   It s eye opening  A lot of cadets have a love of nature begin with  but a lot of them don t have an idea of how exciting this aspect of biology is  with all the field work and conservation opportunities  That excitement was echoed by all the cadets studying bats in the field   I really enjoy being out in the field rather than in a lab or office  said Western   I love hiking  and I love animals  so I couldn t have wound up in a better spot  By   John Robertson IV IR   Aug  2012 Life
