of updating America s transportation infrastructure in a way that is efficient  innovative  and safe  Cadets are using top of the line software in combination with fieldwork get the most out of the course   I have learned that transportation engineering is a lot more complex than what I anticipated based on my initial interest  said Cadet Christian Richardson  13   This subject matter will be very important in the near future  as America s aging infrastructure requires updates and new designs to support the population and increased traffic volumes  Members of the class are also learning that flawed transportation design can put drivers in danger   People s lives are on the line with your designs  said Nicholas Gore  13   This is why our professors in the civil engineering department hand out so much homework and grade our work harshly  They are preparing us for the real world where major mistakes can end up in court  Their instructor  assistant professor of civil engineering Maj  Wakeel Idewu  is taking his students outside of the classroom to study real world scenarios   I m trying to incorporate real life things into the class  either by bringing the class to the field or bring the field to the class  said Idewu   I try to pick projects that are in progress or are being planned by the city  and I pose that as a project for them to work out   It is a great way to tie everything together  said Gore   He likes to get us out of the classroom and give us the opportunity to really apply the information we have learned in class and through this experience you realize how important transportation design has become  Idewu is finding ways to challenge his students  basing his assignments on local traffic patterns   We have used a lot of real world examples in class  said Gore   My personal favorite is when our class redesigned an intersection that used a bridge in Lexington  but we had to eliminate the bridge and place a vertical sag curve instead  It took all of our knowledge up to that point to tackle this question  It was both challenging and very rewarding when my team accomplished the task  Cadets in the class are using VISSIM  a professional traffic simulation program  which allows users to predict how traffic will flow through a given route   The idea is to train cadets to use this  and then they can use all the fundamentals they ve learned in class up to that point to re design an intersection  said Idewu  VISSIM is microscopic transportation simulation software  meaning that it has the ability to predict the actions of drivers and pedestrians on an individual basis  The software is being used by many transportation consulting firms  so familiarity with this software will be valuable when cadets in the course start looking for a job   Not many people know how to use this software  so being trained on it and using it in class gives them an advantage over other graduates that are looking to move towards the transportation field

the classroom and give us the opportunity to really apply the information we have learned in class and through this experience you realize how important transportation design has become  Idewu is finding ways to challenge his students  basing his assignments on local traffic patterns   We have used a lot of real world examples in class  said Gore   My personal favorite is when our class redesigned an intersection that used a bridge in Lexington  but we had to eliminate the bridge and place a vertical sag curve instead  It took all of our knowledge up to that point to tackle this question  It was both challenging and very rewarding when my team accomplished the task  Cadets in the class are using VISSIM  a professional traffic simulation program  which allows users to predict how traffic will flow through a given route   The idea is to train cadets to use this  and then they can use all the fundamentals they ve learned in class up to that point to re design an intersection  said Idewu  VISSIM is microscopic transportation simulation software  meaning that it has the ability to predict the actions of drivers and pedestrians on an individual basis  The software is being used by many transportation consulting firms  so familiarity with this software will be valuable when cadets in the course start looking for a job   Not many people know how to use this software  so being trained on it and using it in class gives them an advantage over other graduates that are looking to move towards the transportation field  said Idewu  By  John Robertson IV IR   Nov  2013  VMI
