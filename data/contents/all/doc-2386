wanted to take this opportunity to update you on the incredible work your Keydet Club staff and members have done recently to help support our Keydets  First  I want to say thank you to the 2 731 members who contributed to the Keydet Club in support of VMI s cadet athletes  Because VMI s student body is one of the smallest in Division I  your support may be the most impactful across the country in Division I  Your generosity enabled the Keydet Club to realize another record year for annual and endowment support of VMI athletics in Fiscal Year 2014  Together we raised  1 706 609 for the Keydet Club Scholarship Fund and  1 428 768 for Athletic Operations Funds to reach a combined annual giving total of  3 135 377  This alone is a note worthy achievement when looking at other athletic fundraising organizations  However  we didn t just stop there  We also added  3 061 145 to the Keydet Club endowment  That made Fiscal Year 2014 the largest fundraising year in Keydet Club history  The combined total was  6 196 522 for the fiscal year  surpassing the previous record of  5 089 953 realized in Fiscal Year 2013  This is an increase of  1 100 838 in private support to our cadet athletes  I am delighted  but not surprised  to see what the Keydet Club accomplished this year  We should all be proud of what we have achieved together  Finally  I want to encourage all members of the VMI family to support the Keydet Club  July 1st started a new fiscal year and a new opportunity for us to continue to climb to where we need to be in the  new  Southern Conference  Every school in our league is pleading with their  family  to pledge their support  VMI needs to rise to the top of this group  but we cannot do it with only 19  of our donor base  With 2 731 members contributing almost  6 2 million to the Keydet Club this past year  we should all recognize the incredible opportunity we have in front of us  VMI has always risen above a challenge  and now is our chance  We can and need to grow our membership in the Keydet Club  It is time for VMI to WIN  Rah VA Mil      Bill Paulette  69 President VMI Keydet Club  Inc  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni

just stop there  We also added  3 061 145 to the Keydet Club endowment  That made Fiscal Year 2014 the largest fundraising year in Keydet Club history  The combined total was  6 196 522 for the fiscal year  surpassing the previous record of  5 089 953 realized in Fiscal Year 2013  This is an increase of  1 100 838 in private support to our cadet athletes  I am delighted  but not surprised  to see what the Keydet Club accomplished this year  We should all be proud of what we have achieved together  Finally  I want to encourage all members of the VMI family to support the Keydet Club  July 1st started a new fiscal year and a new opportunity for us to continue to climb to where we need to be in the  new  Southern Conference  Every school in our league is pleading with their  family  to pledge their support  VMI needs to rise to the top of this group  but we cannot do it with only 19  of our donor base  With 2 731 members contributing almost  6 2 million to the Keydet Club this past year  we should all recognize the incredible opportunity we have in front of us  VMI has always risen above a challenge  and now is our chance  We can and need to grow our membership in the Keydet Club  It is time for VMI to WIN  Rah VA Mil      Bill Paulette  69 President VMI Keydet Club  Inc                VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club
