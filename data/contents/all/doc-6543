Object Danger No Object For Col  James Gire  the relationship between risk and reward is far from an academic exercise  It s a tension the psychology professor explores each summer  as he travels back to his native Nigeria to teach at Benue State University  where he holds a visiting professorship  Gire  who s been traveling to Nigeria annually for the past eight or so years  says that the day to day situation there is getting worse  as the Islamic militant group Boko Haram carries out terrorist style random attacks on roadways  shopping malls  and other public places  The group  which seeks to install an Islamic state in the former British colony  also kidnapped more than 200 girls from their school in April  prompting an international outcry  For Nigerians  though  the rhythm of life goes on  although with the knowledge that the terrorist group could strike at any moment   Even in a war zone  people still go out  said Gire of his decision to keep returning to his homeland each summer  even as the violence escalates  In July  that violence struck even closer to home  as Gire s sister was en route to work one morning when a terrorist bomb exploded just 100 yards from her car  Shaken but unhurt  she turned around and went home  Her brother  though  has vowed to keep returning to Nigeria  so he can extend educational opportunities to a group of young people so desperate for a university education that undergraduates often stand outside open windows so they can hear lectures  Thankfully  the Nigerian state of Benue  where Benue State University is located  is far from the violence  which has so far been confined mostly to the northern half of the country  with its majority Muslim population  Students at Benue State generally feel safe  Gire said  and they concentrate

overseas when he earned a scholarship to the London School of Economics  where he earned a master s degree  Two more scholarships propelled him to McMaster University in Ontario  Canada  where he earned a doctorate in experimental psychology  He s taught at VMI for the past 20 years  At Benue State  Gire finds students who are eager to follow his path  if only they could  Motivation isn t a problem  as it can be at VMI  Gire admitted  but resources are a definite issue  Internet access is limited in Nigeria  and libraries simply don t have databases  or even recent books  making research an almost futile struggle   If you don t have a database  you have no way of knowing what relevant articles  periodicals  and books are in your area of research  he commented   If you don t know

in his office in Carroll Hall far into the wee hours of the morning  reading papers for students from Nigeria  and assisting them in their database searches  It s a second shift of work after a full day of teaching at VMI and doing research for his own writing  which recently has included two entries in the Encyclopedia of Cross Cultural Psychology published last fall  Gire also serves as chair of the psychology department  which didn t even exist as its own entity when he came to VMI  At the time of his arrival  in July 1994  psychology was a supporting element to the department of

Philosophy   Danger No Object Danger No Object For Col  James Gire  the relationship between risk and reward is far from an academic exercise  It s a tension the psychology professor explores each summer  as he travels back to his native Nigeria to teach at Benue State University  where he holds a visiting professorship  Gire  who s been traveling to Nigeria annually for the past eight or so years  says that the day to day situation there is getting worse  as the Islamic militant group Boko Haram carries out terrorist style random attacks on roadways  shopping malls  and other public places  The group  which seeks to install an Islamic state in the former British colony  also kidnapped more than 200 girls from their school in April  prompting an international outcry  For Nigerians  though  the rhythm of life goes on  although with the knowledge that the terrorist group could strike at any moment   Even in a war zone  people still go out  said Gire of his decision to keep returning to his homeland each summer  even as the violence escalates  In July  that violence struck even closer to home  as Gire s sister was en route to work one morning when a terrorist bomb exploded just 100 yards from her car  Shaken but unhurt  she turned around and went home  Her brother  though  has vowed to keep returning to Nigeria  so he can extend educational opportunities to a group of young people so desperate for a university education that undergraduates often stand outside open windows so they can hear lectures  Thankfully  the Nigerian state of Benue  where Benue State University is located  is far from the violence  which has so far been confined mostly to the northern half of the country  with its majority Muslim population  Students at Benue State generally feel safe  Gire said  and they concentrate their efforts on earning a degree so they can have a chance at leaving the country   People are continually trying to find ways to go overseas  for the most part  he said  Gire found his way to go overseas when he earned a scholarship to the London School of Economics  where he earned a master s degree  Two more scholarships propelled him to McMaster University in Ontario  Canada  where he earned a doctorate in experimental psychology  He s taught at VMI for the past 20 years  At Benue State  Gire finds students who are eager to follow his path  if only they could  Motivation isn t a problem  as it can be at VMI  Gire admitted  but resources are a definite issue  Internet access is limited in Nigeria  and libraries simply don t have databases  or even recent books  making research an almost futile struggle   If you don t have a database  you have no way of knowing what relevant articles  periodicals  and books are in your area of research  he commented   If you don t know something exists  you can t use it  Because of this  Gire spends much time helping his overseas students find the resources they need  During the academic year  it s not uncommon to find him working in his office in Carroll Hall far into the wee hours of the morning  reading papers for students from Nigeria  and assisting them in their database searches  It s a second shift of work after a full day of teaching at VMI and doing research for his own writing  which recently has included two entries in the Encyclopedia of Cross Cultural Psychology published last fall  Gire also serves as chair of the psychology department  which didn t even exist as its own entity when he came to VMI  At the time of his arrival  in July 1994  psychology was a supporting element to the department of behavioral sciences and leadership  Even as he teaches and mentors cadets  though  Gire strives to help his Nigerian students reach their goals   Nigeria is  where I grew up  and I know they need help  said Gire of his decision to give back so freely   That s my international version of community service    I m now a U S  citizen  but you never forget where you came from  In that same spirit  Gire urges his predominantly Christian students in Nigeria to make a difference in their world  by whatever means possible   People have a fatalistic view of Christianity  in my opinion  he noted   But  God works through people    Even when God gave manna in the wilderness  he didn t put it in people s mouths  You had to go out there and grab it  or otherwise you starved  Gire often tells his Nigerian students   It s not that God loves people in the West more  If you make efforts  you see improvements in outcomes  Risk  it seems  is often followed by reward  By  Mary
