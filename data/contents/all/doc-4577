along far outweighed any of this to the point that it became negligible  I had never before been out of the U S  excluding Canada  so I had not really seen any part of the world out of my backyard  Morocco was definitely a whole new land and being there allowed me to really get a taste of how people all over the world live  The language barrier was fun to work with as well as around  The whole experience was awesome in both my advancement in education as well as my life experiences    Connor Downs  12 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health
