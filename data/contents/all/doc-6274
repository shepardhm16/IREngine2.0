Bishop and Col  Dave Miller  interim director of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  look on    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Feb  25  2014   Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority Officer Richard  Dic  Donohue  02 suffered severe blood loss in an early morning shootout with the alleged Boston Marathon bombers last April  With only a 2 percent chance of survival and after some 40 minutes without a pulse  he survived  thanks to the quick actions of many law enforcement  emergency  and medical personnel  This afternoon he addressed the Corps of Cadets as the Corps speaker of the 2014 VMI Leadership Conference  The conference took cadets from their classes  as they attended speeches and participated in group discussions around post throughout the day   The theme of the conference was  George Washington  The American Cincinnatus  Cadets were challenged to consider their personal vision  actions  and character and how Washington s leadership example is relevant today   The VMI experience lends itself to such a challenge  as leadership  even if I don t point it out explicitly  said Donohue  He recounted the events leading up to his injury  starting from the time he heard news of the first explosion and confirmed fatalities to days later when he and his partner responded to back up officers in a firefight with the suspects  He commended the command decisions that law enforcement  emergency  and medical personnel made on the scene to save his life  and noted the efforts of so many  from doctors who were at home in bed asleep who came in to operate to the blood donors who ensured availability of the blood products he needed   Everything I ve talked about so far has been the easy part   I was doing my job  I got hurt  I went down  people took care of me  Donohue said  For the next two months after the successful surgery  he was in the hospital  and he continues the rehabilitation process some 10 months later   I ve had ups and downs  good days  and some of the worst days of my life  he said  Donohue described elements important to good leadership that were called on that day   preparation  great people  and clear vision  While Donohue said he was not exactly ready for what happened to him  he pointed out that he had acquired the tools that made him better prepared through his education and experience  The lines blur  he said  between education and experience at VMI   We know that there are no free rides  at VMI  and grades and a diploma do not come easily  Donohue said   This translates directly into a strong work ethic  Donohue said surrounding oneself with great people does not mean cadets have to be around those people every day  Members of his class started fundraising for him and his family  and he received calls and e mails from alumni and well wishes from cadets on post  many he had not spoken to recently  or ever  Donohue said that clear vision allows one to be determined to make things right   We will heal  recover  and find those responsible  His goal is to return to the police force  He ended by telling cadets not to be afraid to make mistakes and to remember that every cadet is a leader   See more
