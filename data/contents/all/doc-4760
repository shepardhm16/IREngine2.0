of Marine Meiofauna Meiofauna are small animals found in sand  including some entire phyla  e g  Kinorhyncha and Gastrotricha  and major clades of other phyla  e g  Platyhelminthes  Arthropoda  Annelida  Nematoda  In nearly all marine sediments  nematodes are the most abundant and diverse members of the meiofauana  I am currently collaborating with a number of colleagues in a project funded by the Smithsonian Institution s Marine Science Network to explore spatial and habitat patterns of meiofauna diversity  The project is led by Jon Norenburg of the Smithsonian s National Museum of Natural History  NMNH  We are using both morphology and DNA barcode data to document meiofauana diversity at sites in Belize and Panama  Marine Nematode Diversity at Carrie Bow Cay  Belize The Smithsonian NMNH maintains a marine laboratory on Carrie Bow Cay in Belize  This one acre island sits 10 miles offshore on the Mesoamerican Barrier reef  In January of 2010 I joined 5 other meiofauana experts for 2 weeks of meiofauna collecting on Carrie Bow Cay  My Mexican colleague Alberto de Jesus Navarrete and I are currently compiling a preliminary checklist of the marine nematodes from Carrie

trips to the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute s  STRI  Bocas del Toro marine research laboratory on the Caribbean coast of Panama  As part of my marine meiofauana biogeography collaboration  my colleagues and I conducted a Meiofauna Diversity and Taxonomy Training course at Bocas del Toro in June  2010  This workshop was sponsored by the Smithsonian and the Encyclopedia of Life  My Hamilton College students and I are working to characterize the nematode diversity from this island and surrounding archipelago to contribute to STRI s growing on line species database for Bocas del Toro  In the summer of 2010  my students mounted over 1 000 nematodes on slides and fully imaged 60 species  with detailed images of head and tail regions and reproductive structures needed for identification
