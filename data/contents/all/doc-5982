and Maj  John David work with a computer model    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  July 17  2013   Cadet James Snyder  13 didn t have any trouble picking a topic for his Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project  After all  he s an applied math major with a lifelong interest in sports   so why not delve into the use of statistics to predict the outcome of basketball games  This summer  Snyder is working under the guidance of Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics  to take data from several seasons  worth of NBA games and use that data to build a computer model which can predict the outcome of future games  Snyder  a Georgia native and avid fan of the Atlanta Hawks  got interested in doing a sports oriented summer research project when his friend Will Lucas  14 did a similar project on baseball last summer  David  also a lifelong sports enthusiast  already had experience with predicting professional football games  and he d overseen Lucas  work  so he welcomed Snyder s interest  Snyder began by taking NBA statistics from six seasons  With 30 teams in the association  each playing 82 games per season  and 32 statistics available per team  Snyder found himself almost drowning in information   There are millions of data points  Snyder commented   We re taking all that data and using it to make future predictions for the games  To check for accuracy  Snyder fed data from the 2004 2009 seasons into the computer and asked it to make predictions for the 2010 season  So far  Snyder s program has racked up an impressive accuracy rate of 72 to 73 percent   which puts him in a position to be competitive with  or even outdo  popular websites that claim to be able to predict the outcomes of games   We re on pace with those guys and I m pleased with that  he said  For Snyder  the summer project has been an ideal capstone to his time at VMI  which is rapidly coming to a close   You get to do math and see the outcome of sports  he said   That s fascinating to me  We re doing some pretty complex math techniques    and at the same time we get to play with basketball statistics  Snyder has already accepted a job with the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore  Md  which has hired several VMI graduates over the past few years  There  he ll be testing technology for submarines and other forms of undersea warfare  His work there will begin Aug  12   I m hoping to take some of the research I ve done this summer and apply it on the military government side of things  said Snyder  who played center on the VMI football team during his cadetship  And since he ll be in the neighborhood  Snyder is planning to join David to give a presentation on math and sports at a meeting of three major mathematical organizations  to be held in Baltimore in January   The interest in using quantitative analysis in sports has really grown in the past 10 or 15 years  said David  who enjoys informal games of pickup basketball with a group of professors and cadets  He continued   It s a fascinatingly rich thing in math  It s a rich area for machine learning and quantitative analysis and data mining   It s a wonderful training tool  I can trick  the cadets  into some of this stuff by using sports   Mary Price   VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES

LEXINGTON  Va  July 17  2013   Cadet James Snyder  13 didn t have any trouble picking a topic for his Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project  After all  he s an applied math major with a lifelong interest in sports   so why not delve into the use of statistics to predict the outcome of basketball games  This summer  Snyder is working under the guidance of Maj  John David  assistant professor of applied mathematics  to take data from several seasons  worth of NBA games and use that data to build a computer model which can predict the outcome of future games  Snyder  a Georgia native and avid fan of the Atlanta Hawks  got interested in doing a sports oriented summer research project when his friend Will Lucas  14 did a similar project on baseball last summer  David  also a lifelong sports enthusiast  already had experience with predicting professional football games  and he d overseen Lucas  work  so he welcomed Snyder s interest  Snyder began by taking NBA statistics from six seasons  With 30 teams in the association  each playing 82 games per season  and 32 statistics available per team  Snyder found himself almost drowning in information   There are millions of data points  Snyder commented   We re taking all that data and using it to make future predictions for the games  To check for accuracy  Snyder fed data from the 2004 2009 seasons into the computer and asked it to make predictions for the 2010 season  So far  Snyder s program has racked up an impressive accuracy rate of 72 to 73 percent   which puts him in a position to be competitive with  or even outdo  popular websites that claim to be able to predict the outcomes of games   We re on pace with those guys and I m pleased with that  he said  For Snyder  the summer project has been an ideal capstone to his time at VMI  which is rapidly coming to a close   You get to do math and see the outcome of sports  he said   That s fascinating to me  We re doing some pretty complex math techniques    and at the same time we get to play with basketball statistics  Snyder has already accepted a job with the Applied Physics Lab at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore  Md  which has hired several VMI graduates over the past few years  There  he ll be testing technology for submarines and other forms of undersea warfare  His work there will begin Aug  12   I m hoping to take some of the research I ve done this summer and apply it on the military government side of things  said Snyder  who played center on the VMI football team during his cadetship  And since he ll be in the neighborhood  Snyder is planning to join David to give a presentation on math and sports at a meeting of three major mathematical organizations  to be held in Baltimore in January   The interest in using quantitative analysis in sports has really grown in the past 10 or 15 years  said David  who enjoys informal games of pickup basketball with a group of professors and cadets  He continued   It s a fascinatingly rich thing in math  It s a rich area for machine learning and quantitative analysis and data mining   It s a wonderful training tool  I can trick  the cadets  into some of this stuff
