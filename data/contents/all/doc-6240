ECE Undergraduate Research Offerings EE 493   ECE Undergraduate Research Offerings EE 493 01   Carbon Nanotube  CNT  Sensor Devices This interdisciplinary project is a collaborative effort between VMI ECE and the Roanoke College Physics Department  Early research will focus on the development of carbon nanotubes  and the design of electronic devices  C FETs  to be used in biological and chemical sensing  Future research will focus on the characterization of these devices  Occasional travel to Roanoke College is encouraged and will be supported  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD EE 493 02   Bioengineering Research will focus on the design and fabrication of miniaturized biosensor devices and packaging  Characterization of these devices  for specific biomedical applications  will also be investigated  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD EE 493 03   Design  Fabrication  and Characterization of Bipolar Junction Transistors In recent years  student members of the Microelectronics and Semiconductor Research Team have designed  fabricated  and characterized a number of electronic devices  including several types of field effect transistors  FETs  and digital logic gates  In this project  cadets will design  fabricate  and characterize the first bipolar junction transistors  BJTs  ever made at VMI using the ECE Semiconductor Device Laboratory facilities  At the beginning of their research  cadets will be trained on the proper use of computer aided design  CAD  tools  as well as all laboratory processing and testing equipment  Cadets will then have the opportunity to begin the development of their custom made devices  following the tradition of the ECE Semiconductor Device Laboratory  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD EE 493 04   Semiconductor Device Fabrication   Mathematical Device Modeling This interdisciplinary project is a collaborative effort between VMI ECE and the VMI Mathematics Department  Using the capabilities of the ECE Semiconductor Laboratory  cadets will first develop basic semiconductor devices  and then work with the VMI MA Dept  to develop accurate mathematical device models to be subsequently used in the refinement of device performance  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD EE 493 05   Radio Frequency Identification The use of Radio Frequency Identification  RFID  technology is becoming increasingly prevalent in today s society   from gas pumps and package tracking to automobile entry and secure facility access  In this project  cadets will design and develop their own RFID devices  using the capabilities of the ECE Microelectronics Laboratory  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD EE 493 06   Optoelectronics The ECE Microelectronics Laboratory has the capability to design and fabricate a variety of optoelectronic devices and packages  based on electroluminescence technologies  light emission upon electronic excitation  electric current or field  This project will provide cadets several opportunities to expand on recent efforts in this area  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD EE 493 07   Semiconductor Doping Processing   Characterization Semiconductor doping involves the selective incorporation  diffusion  of specific impurities into semiconductor  silicon  wafers to achieve desired electrical characteristics and performance  This research project will investigate  1  the effect of pre diffusion wet oxidation on initial dopant redistribution and the resulting electrical resistivity of the wafers   2  the effect of diffusion processing parameters  time and temperature  on the subsequent electrical resistivity of the wafers  and  3  the effect of post diffusion dry oxidation on dopant redistribution and the resulting electrical resistivity of the wafers  Resulting data curves will be used to inform the planning of future semiconductor device designs and fabrication procedures that rely on dopant diffusion  and pre  and post diffusion oxidations  Credits   TBD EE 493 08   CMOS Technology Recent upgrades to the ECE Semiconductor Laboratory facilities now permits the realization of devices based on CMOS technology   the fundamental technology behind virtually all microprocessors  memory  etc  Cadets will design  fabricate  and characterize various NMOS  PMOS  and CMOS structures  At the beginning of their research  cadets will be trained on the proper use of computer aided design  CAD  tools  as well as all laboratory processing and testing equipment  Cadets will then have the opportunity to begin the development of their custom made devices  following the tradition of the ECE Semiconductor Device Laboratory  Course capacity is 2 cadets  Credits   TBD  Col  Shawn Addington Home Courses Undergrad
