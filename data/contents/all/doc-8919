In Trouble for Being Honest Our teacher asked what my favorite animal was  and I said   Fried chicken  She said I wasn t funny  but she couldn t have been right  because everyone else laughed  My parents told me to always tell the truth  I did  Fried chicken is my favorite animal  I told my dad what happened  and he said my teacher was probably a member of PETA  He said they love animals  Very much  I do  too  especially chicken and beef  Anyway  my teacher sent me to the principal s office  I told him what happened  and he laughed  too  Then he told me not to do it again  The next day in class my teacher asked me what my favorite live animal was  I told her it was chicken  She asked me why  so I told her it was because you could make them into fried chicken  She sent me back to the principal s office  He laughed  and told me not to do it again  I don t understand  My parents taught me to be honest  but my teacher doesn t like it when I am  Today  my teacher asked me to tell her what famous person I admired most  I told her   Colonel Sanders  Guess where I am now
