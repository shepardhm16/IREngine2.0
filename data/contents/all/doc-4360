Trey Jarrell Enjoys First Top Five NASCAR Whelen All American Series Finish Trey Jarrell s young career made huge strides last Saturday when he finished fifth in the BAIRD Drywall and Acoustics BARNBURNER presented by LINE X of the Blue Ridge at Motor Mile Speedway  The 16 year old rookie driver from Martinsville  Va  posted his first top five finish in his NASCAR Whelen All American Series career by driving his Sellers Racing Toyota from 10th place in the final 125 laps at Motor Mile Speedway   We had a great car thanks to Sellers Racing and all my partners  Virginia Military Institute  VMI  Keydet Club  AutosByNelson  East Coast Synthetics  Rhoades Car International and PitRowLEDS com  Jarrell said   The race really lived up to its name   Barnburner   It s amazing just how far we ve come in our first year  Our first race was in May and now we re up in the top five  We set out with an ambitious schedule this year  and we seem to get better and better each race  Things are really starting to come together for us at Sellers Racing  Jarrell qualified sixth for the 250 lap main event at the 4 10 mile paved oval  He was 10th at the midway intermission when his team made changes to the No  14 Virginia Military Institute  VMI  Keydet Club Toyota  That allowed him to rally during the second half while making veteran driver saves and finish fifth in a field of 27 entries   We finished with a few bumps and bruises  Jarrell said   It was typical short track racing  It gets a little more heated the closer you get to the front  For me  it was another important learning experience   We continued to push forward and we got our best finish yet out of it  So now the goal is to improve on it  Lee Pulliam won the race  followed by Matt Bowling in second  Brandon Dean in third and defending track champion Josh Berry in fourth  Jarrell s next opportunity to improve on his first top five finish will be the CNC Supply TWIN 125s on Sept  21 at Motor Mile  VMI Foundation
