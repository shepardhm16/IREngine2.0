Martin Smith opens the 2013 Honor Conference at VMI    VMI Photo by Julie Rivera  LEXINGTON  Va  March 4  2013   Frontline producer Martin Smith opened the 2013 Honor Conference at VMI with a discussion of how truth seeking journalism can encourage more honorable behavior by public officials  Smith  a 28 year veteran of broadcast journalism  is a past winner of the coveted Edward R  Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club  as well as an Emmy  He and his production company  RAINMedia  have most recently been in the news for their January 2013 production   The Untouchables  an expose of the U S  Justice Department s failure to prosecute the Wall Street bankers involved in the 2008 financial crisis  This year s honor conference is a follow up to the 2012 Biennial Leadership Conference  held at the same time last year  which was entitled   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  The 2013 gathering has attracted more than 270 students  teachers  and faculty members  with roughly two thirds of them coming from high schools across Virginia  The current conference is entitled   Building and Strengthening Honor Codes  Inspiring Honor and Respect  In his remarks  entitled  Deciding Your Story  Smith didn t often use the word  honor  but he did talk about how a lack of honor s close cousin  integrity  has manifested itself in the world today  Much of Smith s work as a documentary producer has revolved around exposing a lack of integrity among public officials  Notable situations he s investigated in his almost three decades of work include the George W  Bush administration s statements about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the Federal Emergency Management Agency s mishandling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath  Producing films that bring ethically questionable behavior to light isn t just a game of  gotcha  for the purpose of embarrassment  Smith explained   Journalists are obligated to reveal things as they are so people like you can be nudged and prodded to go out and make the world a better place  Smith told his audience   Journalists  along with the First Amendment protections that sanction free speech  are part and parcel of what make the world a better place  he continued   So much of TV is a vast wasteland of screaming idiots  but imagine a world without the news  What would you know  Smith spent much time discussing how investigative journalism can identify problems before they explode onto the national or international stage   but only if people pay attention  As one example  Smith mentioned his 1998 work   Hunting bin Laden  which was meant to highlight the threat posed by the al Qaeda leader  Smith recalled his producers at Frontline as saying   Why should we run this  Who is this guy  In the days after Sept  11  2001  Smith received inquiries about getting a copy of the film from both then Vice President Dick Cheney and England s Queen Elizabeth II   For me  it s most satisfying when the reporting we do has made a clear difference  when it s helped people to understand our world  not through telling them how to think  but by giving them the information they need to make their own informed choices  Smith commented  Contrary to popular perceptions  Smith said that he does not approach the news with a political agenda   and he feels that reporting is a skill in decline  one in danger of being replaced by biased  blog based punditry  In terms of news choices  Smith offered the analogy of food choices   We can eat junk food or we can eat real food  he noted  Smith concluded   We  journalists  remain aggressive and we remain disruptive    We live in a democracy  Good journalism should rattle people  make people upset enough to go out and make things better  to be involved citizens and care  and to go out and vote  After all  government belongs to us  or at least it should  Smith s talk was followed by a short vignette   Caught in the Act or Not  played out by VMI cadets Louis Burton  16 and Sarah McGinnis  16  In the vignette  Burton and Ford commiserated about their overwhelming workloads and agreed to share notes and  help  each other through a difficult semester  The dramatization was meant to leave the audience with a question to ponder  had Burton and Ford crossed the line when it came to honor  Attendees were invited to think about that question in terms of their own school s honor code in a 40 minute breakout session  At the end of the breakout session  they gathered again in Gillis Theater to hear from representatives of three schools   The Citadel  the University of Mary Washington  and Washington and Lee University   talk about what would happen at each school should such a situation be reported  The 2013 Honor Conference continues with more vignettes and discussion of honor codes today  Tomorrow  the conference will continue with a morning session on due process  consistency  and accountability  followed by a variety of workshop sessions  More workshop sessions will take place in the afternoon  to be followed by a talk   Sportsmanship  Citizenship and Ethics  to be given at 3

Honor Conference at VMI    VMI Photo by Julie Rivera  LEXINGTON  Va  March 4  2013   Frontline producer Martin Smith opened the 2013 Honor Conference at VMI with a discussion of how truth seeking journalism can encourage more honorable behavior by public officials  Smith  a 28 year veteran of broadcast journalism  is a past winner of the coveted Edward R  Murrow Award from the Overseas Press Club  as well as an Emmy  He and his production company  RAINMedia  have most recently been in the news for their January 2013 production   The Untouchables  an expose of the U S  Justice Department s failure to prosecute the Wall Street bankers involved in the 2008 financial crisis  This year s honor conference is a follow up to the 2012 Biennial Leadership Conference  held at the same time last year  which was entitled   Cheating  Lying and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  The 2013 gathering has attracted more than 270 students  teachers  and faculty members  with roughly two thirds of them coming from high schools across Virginia  The current conference is entitled   Building and Strengthening Honor Codes  Inspiring Honor and Respect  In his remarks  entitled  Deciding Your Story  Smith didn t often use the word  honor  but he did talk about how a lack of honor s close cousin  integrity  has manifested itself in the world today  Much of Smith s work as a documentary producer has revolved around exposing a lack of integrity among public officials  Notable situations he s investigated in his almost three decades of work include the George W  Bush administration s statements about the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the Federal Emergency Management Agency s mishandling of Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath  Producing films that bring ethically questionable behavior to light isn t just a game of  gotcha  for the purpose of embarrassment  Smith explained   Journalists are obligated to reveal things as they are so people like you can be nudged and prodded to go out and make the world a better place  Smith told his audience   Journalists  along with the First Amendment protections that sanction free speech  are part and parcel of what make the world a better place  he continued   So much of TV is a vast wasteland of screaming idiots  but imagine a world without the news  What would you know  Smith spent much time discussing how investigative journalism can identify problems before they explode onto the national or international stage   but only if people pay attention  As one example  Smith mentioned his 1998 work   Hunting bin Laden  which was meant to highlight the threat posed by the al Qaeda leader  Smith recalled his producers at Frontline as saying   Why should we run this  Who is this guy  In the days after Sept  11  2001  Smith received inquiries about getting a copy of the film from both then Vice President Dick Cheney and England s Queen Elizabeth II   For me  it s most satisfying when the reporting we do has made a clear difference  when it s helped people to understand our world  not through telling them how to think  but by giving them the information they need to make their own informed choices  Smith commented  Contrary to popular perceptions  Smith said that he does not approach the news with a political agenda   and he feels that reporting is a skill in decline  one in danger of being replaced by biased  blog based punditry  In terms of news choices  Smith offered the analogy of food choices   We can eat junk food or we can eat real food  he noted  Smith concluded   We  journalists  remain aggressive and we remain disruptive    We live in a democracy  Good journalism should rattle people  make people upset enough to go out and make things better  to be involved citizens and care  and to go out and vote  After all  government belongs to us  or at least it should  Smith s talk was followed by a short vignette   Caught in the Act or Not  played out by VMI cadets Louis Burton  16 and Sarah McGinnis  16  In the vignette  Burton and Ford commiserated about their overwhelming workloads and agreed to share notes and  help  each other through a difficult semester  The dramatization was meant to leave the audience with a question to ponder  had Burton and Ford crossed the line when it came to honor  Attendees were invited to think about that question in terms of their own school s honor code in a 40 minute breakout session  At the end of the breakout session  they gathered again in Gillis Theater to hear from representatives of three schools   The Citadel  the University of Mary Washington  and Washington and Lee University   talk about what would happen at each school should such a situation be reported  The 2013 Honor Conference continues with more vignettes and discussion of honor codes today  Tomorrow  the conference will continue with a morning session on due process  consistency  and accountability  followed by a variety of workshop sessions  More workshop sessions will take place in the afternoon  to be followed by a talk   Sportsmanship  Citizenship and Ethics  to be given at 3 30 p m  by Edward H  Jurith  U S
