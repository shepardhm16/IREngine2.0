colleges  to provide cadets the education needed to meet the challenges of a fast growing country  to develop citizen soldiers  and to graduate honorable  purposeful  and resolute leaders  Now  175 years later  much has changed about the Institute  but  it retains this same uncommon purpose  Since it was founded in 1937  the VMI Foundation has been committed to a single purpose  advancing the Institute by providing it with the private financial resources it needs to fulfill the vision of its founders  Assuredly  the VMI Foundation s financial support has been critical to VMI s success  Just as assuredly  the Institute will rely on the Foundation s support well into the future  Currently  VMI receives more of its annual revenue to meet its operating budget from private funding than it does from the Commonwealth of Virginia  This single statistic highlights the critical importance of the Foundation to the Institute s continued success  Our organization s motto is  Excellentia in Servitio  or  Excellence in Service  and everyone associated with the VMI Foundation strives every day to serve and support the Institute in this manner  The Foundation s dedicated staff meets this challenge because they believe firmly that our country will always need the type of young people who graduate from VMI  I know that the entire Foundation Board of Trustees shares in our professional staff s belief and commitment to service of the Institute  Thank you for your own commitment to advancing the Institute and its current and future cadets  Your generous financial support will enable VMI to thrive and to continue its vital mission for many years to come  About The Foundation Our Mission   President s Message   Message from the CEO   Board of Trustees   Executing our Mission
