Arabic  Chinese  French  German  and Spanish and emphasizes work in literatures  history  and political science  Students of Modern Languages and Cultures thus take a variety of courses aimed toward acquiring knowledge not only of a foreign language  but also of the literature  culture  history  economics  and politics of the country or area where the foreign language they are studying is the major tongue  Since the curriculum allows for 18 hours of unrestricted electives  the department encourages cadets to double major or to minor in another curriculum or to study other foreign languages  a minimum of two years study of each language  The Modern Language and Cultures Department does not accept transfer credit of internet based or distance learning courses at any level  The curriculum is designed to provide a student with skills to function effectively on a shrinking planet  The countries and geographical areas that combine to shape the modern world  while becoming increasingly interconnected and geographically accessible  nevertheless remain far apart in their linguistic  cultural  economic  and political systems  The Modern Languages and Cultures curriculum enhances an understanding of global issues and fosters in depth knowledge of a country or area  Graduates of the curriculum should thus be well prepared to pursue advanced study in a variety of fields or to find positions in teaching  the armed forces  government  the foreign service  or in multinational firms  The curriculum of Modern Languages and Cultures lays the groundwork for an individual to assume a leadership role in an increasingly internationalized world  To earn a bachelor s degree a cadet must take all prescribed courses and acquire a minimum of 24 credit hours above the 200 level in one foreign language  A minimum of 9 credit hours must be earned in 400 level language courses   please consult the  Synopsis of the Modern Languages and Cultures Curriculum  Majors must either study
