keeping up to date on engineering topics  First adopted in 1914  the ASCE Code of Ethics is the model for professional conduct for ASCE members  The Code of Ethics was most recently updated on July 23  2006  You can access the full text of this publication   http www asce org code of ethics  You may want to use  A Question of Ethics  to identify an ethics case study This column offers an

others may prefer broader or narrower definitions  but to us an Engineering Case is  an account of an engineering activity  event or problem containing some of the background and complexities actually encountered by an engineer  A case is used in engineering courses to enhance learning about engineering principles and practices    GMU LibGuide For VMI s CE 109 we will be finding background information about the Kansas City Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse in 1981  Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse On the evening of July 17  1981  what was the deadliest structural collapse in U S  history struck Kansas City s year old Hyatt Regency Hotel when two suspended walkways collapsed  killing 114 people and injuring 216 more  The failure was traced to a change in the original design for the walkways The structural engineer of record denied responsibility  attributing the failure to a breakdown in communication  but investigators were not persuaded  and the engineering practice lost its license  Thirty years later  ASCE reflects on the disaster s lasting effects on the civil engineering profession  Read more on the American Society of Civil Engineers  ASCE  website  http www asce org

engineering  It focuses on the collapse of the fourth floor walkway in the Kansas City Hyatt Regency on July 17  1981 in which 114 people were killed and more than 200 people were injured  It mentions that the investigation uncovered two fundamental failures such as the lack of clarity on who bore ultimate responsibility for the structural design and the failure of communication on the parties
