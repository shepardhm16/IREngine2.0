2012   In classrooms  homes  and dorm rooms across the country  students are tested  They face multiple choices on exam sheets and in their daily lives  For many students  the most challenging question is this   To cheat or not to cheat  The VMI Center for Leadership and Ethics  host of the 2012 VMI Leadership Conference   Cheating  Lying  and Honor in America s High Schools  Colleges and Universities  seeks to open a dialogue among educators and students   We ve talked to experts who have been conducting scholarly research on the psychology of academic cheating and have come to find out how complex the problem is  said Capt  Susan Rabern  director of the Virginia Military Institute Center for Leadership and Ethics   We ve learned that in order to reverse the problem  it will require the engagement of not just faculty and staff  but also students as peers    The conference  which will be held March 5 and 6  is geared toward high school and college faculty  staff  and students  including honor councils and honor societies  The agenda for the conference includes presentations by educational psychologist Eric Anderman  David Callahan  author of The Cheating Culture  Why More Americans are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead  James Stewart  author of Tangled Webs  How False Statements are Undermining America  From Martha Stewart to Bernie Madoff  and Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sgt  Salvatore Giunta  Kathleen Rice  Nassau County  N Y  district attorney who is currently prosecuting an SAT cheating case  will also address the conference  Rabern said the focus of the biennial conference on the epidemic of cheating in America s high schools  colleges  and universities originated with members of VMI s Honor Court   We began the planning in the spring of 2011  she said   Since then  we ve come to find out this is a national epidemic that begins in elementary school and continues through the highest levels of the American education system  Speakers will cover topics including who cheats and why  toleration  accountability  and moral courage  Small group discussions and workshops are also planned to encourage ownership and motivate positive change   I think a lot of young people feel like they are under intense pressure to succeed academically  said conference speaker David Callahan   Polls show college students are more stressed out than ever before  and I think those stresses are related to the epidemic cheating we see in our schools  For more information about this conference and The Center for Leadership and Ethics  visit www vmi edu
