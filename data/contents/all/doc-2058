Save Species of Bats   Maj  Paul Moosman searches for eastern small footed bats at Devil s Marbleyard Sept  20  VMI Photo by John Robertson IV   Maj  Paul Moosman  98  assistant professor of biology  is working to understand and protect a species of bat about which little is known  the eastern small footed bat  Myotis leibii  Moosman s research is being funded by a grant from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries  which has supported the research with  33 000 over the past two years    The species is currently under review for endangered status  Since the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service needs population data to list a species as endangered  the first step to protecting these bats is finding out how many there are and how their populations are changing   With small footed bats we don t know enough about their populations to have them listed as endangered  The goal is to come up with a methodology for monitoring populations and measuring whether the bats  numbers are declining or increasing  said Moosman  Every species of bat has its own unique set of behaviors  I m trying to develop something that will work for this bat  The species  like most bats  is nocturnal and roosts during the day among the rocks located on talus slopes  These seemingly barren rock fields offer plenty of crevices in which the bats can roost out of reach of predators  Moosman  who is on sabbatical this fall  is conducting research at several local slopes  including sites at Devil s Marbleyard  Sherando Lake  and St  Mary s Wilderness  Having studied the bats for years  Moosman has learned a significant amount about their ecology  including their preferred roost cavity characteristics   We ve identified the shape of crevices they prefer  so I ve got a pretty good idea in my head of what to look for  said Moosman  Moosman is pioneering new methods for tracking the populations of these bats  Having identified the size and shape of bats  preferred roosting sites  Moosman is able to simply climb around the slope looking in all the likely places until he locates the bats  Given the success he s had finding the bats in their roosts during the day  Moosman has learned that he can determine bat density in a given area by conducting a plot survey  By exhaustively surveying smaller plots  the entire population of bats on a given slope can be determined  In addition to catching bats during the day  Moosman is using nets over the rocks to catch bats as they leave their roosts at nightfall to feed  Transmitters are then attached to the bats  relaying information back to a receiver  Another piece of the puzzle is determining when the bats hibernate  Knowing this will tell researchers at what time of year population studies will produce usable results   I m going to get continuous data this fall to find out how long they re present at the site  said Moosman   At a certain point we ll stop finding them  so then we ll know when they ve left or are hibernating  With the spread of white nose syndrome devastating bat populations across the country  it s imperative to understand whether populations of eastern small footed bats are in decline   We re looking at a continentwide pandemic that s killing off a sizable chunk of our bat diversity  said Moosman   Simply by knowing the basics about this bat  we ll be able to help protect it  In addition to conducting field research during his sabbatical  Moosman is working toward publishing the data that his research has generated so far  His hope is that publishing the findings will generate further interest in the species   These bats are part of our natural heritage  they re part of what makes Virginia unique  said Moosman   Mankind has accelerated the rate of extinctions at an alarming rate  Every species has a purpose in its ecosystem  and we may only learn the purpose of something after it s gone and we see the consequences of its absence  By  John Robertson IV IR   Oct

Looks to Save Species of Bats  Professor s Research Looks to Save Species of Bats   Maj  Paul Moosman searches for eastern small footed bats at Devil s Marbleyard Sept  20  VMI Photo by John Robertson IV   Maj  Paul Moosman  98  assistant professor of biology  is working to understand and protect a species of bat about which little is known  the eastern small footed bat  Myotis leibii  Moosman s research is being funded by a grant from the Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries  which has supported the research with  33 000 over the past two years    The species is currently under review for endangered status  Since the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service needs population data to list a species as endangered  the first step to protecting these bats is finding out how many there are and how their populations are changing   With small footed bats we don t know enough about their populations to have them listed as endangered  The goal is to come up with a methodology for monitoring populations and measuring whether the bats  numbers are declining or increasing  said Moosman  Every species of bat has its own unique set of behaviors  I m trying to develop something that will work for this bat  The species  like most bats  is nocturnal and roosts during the day among the rocks located on talus slopes  These seemingly barren rock fields offer plenty of crevices in which the bats can roost out of reach of predators  Moosman  who is on sabbatical this fall  is conducting research at several local slopes  including sites at Devil s Marbleyard  Sherando Lake  and St  Mary s Wilderness  Having studied the bats for years  Moosman has learned a significant amount about their ecology  including their preferred roost cavity characteristics   We ve identified the shape of crevices they prefer  so I ve got a pretty good idea in my head of what to look for  said Moosman  Moosman is pioneering new methods for tracking the populations of these bats  Having identified the size and shape of bats  preferred roosting sites  Moosman is able to simply climb around the slope looking in all the likely places until he locates the bats  Given the success he s had finding the bats in their roosts during the day  Moosman has learned that he can determine bat density in a given area by conducting a plot survey  By exhaustively surveying smaller plots  the entire population of bats on a given slope can be determined  In addition to catching bats during the day  Moosman is using nets over the rocks to catch bats as they leave their roosts at nightfall to feed  Transmitters are then attached to the bats  relaying information back to a receiver  Another piece of the puzzle is determining when the bats hibernate  Knowing this will tell researchers at what time of year population studies will produce usable results   I m going to get continuous data this fall to find out how long they re present at the site  said Moosman   At a certain point we ll stop finding them  so then we ll know when they ve left or are hibernating  With the spread of white nose syndrome devastating bat populations across the country  it s imperative to understand whether populations of eastern small footed bats are in decline   We re looking at a continentwide pandemic that s killing off a sizable chunk of our bat diversity  said Moosman   Simply by knowing the basics about this bat  we ll be able to help protect it  In addition to conducting field research during his sabbatical  Moosman is working toward publishing the data that his research has generated so far  His hope is that publishing the findings will generate further interest in the species   These bats are part of our natural heritage  they re part of what makes Virginia unique  said Moosman   Mankind has accelerated the rate of extinctions at an alarming rate  Every species has a purpose in its ecosystem  and we may only learn the purpose of something after it s gone and we see the consequences of its absence  By  John Robertson IV IR   Oct  2013 Life Sciences Biology Home Degrees   Programs Courses Scholarships and Awards Frequently Asked Questions Department Activities Alumni   Friends
