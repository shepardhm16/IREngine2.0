Conduction Exact Solutions for Heat Conduction This work involves computing exact solutions for conductive heat transfer problems  primarily to verify finite element codes so that a determination can be made as to the accuracy of the finite element solutions  This work is being conducted with James V  Beck  Professor Emeritus at Michigan State University and president of Beck Engineering Consultants Company  For more information on his work  you can visit his web site at www BeckEng com  Much of this work is documented in a paper entitled  Precise Solutions for Verification in Transient Three Dimensional Cartesian Heat Conduction  in the Journal of Numerical Heat Transfer by McMasters  Dowding Beck and Yen  The tables giving all of the Green s functions for this work can be viewed at Green s Function Tables  One particular aspect of this work is solving conduction problems which include solid body motion  Below is the development of a solution for a one dimensional case with known heat flux on both boundaries  An interesting point associated with this solution is that a non zero eigenvalue appears for the zeroth term in the infinite series solution  This is something which does not occur in solutions involving non moving solids  We now consider the determination of these eigenfunctions and eigenvalues so that the Green s functions may be given  The problem can be described by  1   2   3  The temperature problem can be transformed to remove the solid body motion in eq   1  by using  4    which yields the W problem of 5     6     7    Using the product solution in the separation of variables for W x t    X x Q  t  gives  8  Notice the positive sign before the  term  this is an anomalous term and does not usually occur but may be present depending upon the effective heat transfer coefficients  The presence of this term causes the solid body flow problem to be unique  The solution for the X problem can be written as  9  The boundary conditions for the X problem are  10    Using the boundary condition at x   0 gives  11  Using the condition at x   L gives the eigencondition   12  where   13   14  Using these definitions  eq   12  can be written as  15

The eigenfunction can be written as    18  The solution of the time problem in eq   8  is  19  The zeroth term for the Green s function can then be written as  20  where the norm is given by    21  For the special XU22 case  this reduces to  22  Also for this special case  the eigenfunction simplifies to  23  Using these two equations then gives the zeroth term for the XU22 Green s function of
