Honor  like many idealistic concepts  defies exact definition  The honor system at VMI is not so much a set of rules although rules are published and distributed to every cadet as it is a way of living  Lying  cheating  and stealing are considered violations of the Honor Code  Any work submitted by a student is considered to be the student s own work and that he or she has received no unauthorized help  During the regular session the Honor Code is enforced and guarded by the Corps  Alleged violations are prosecuted by the Honor Court and heard by a jury of cadets selected at random from the Corps  During the Summer Session alleged violations will be heard by a Board of Inquiry made up of Summer Session students  faculty  and administrative personnel  Findings are reported to the Superintendent  During the Summer Session  only students participating in the meal plans are permitted to eat in the Mess Hall  Eating or drinking food provided for the plan without prior payment is a violation of the Honor Code  Participants are permitted to eat all that they want in the dining facility during the scheduled meal time  Taking large amounts of food or drink from the dining facility to consume later in the day is not permitted as doing so would be equivalent to getting two meals for the price of one and would not be in the spirit of the Honor Code  Those participating in the meal plan will be allowed to leave the dining facility with no more than 16 ounces of drink  one piece of fruit  and an ice cream cone  Residing anywhere on Post  other than as guests in the residence of staff and faculty  is also considered a violation of the Honor Code  All students enrolled in the VMI Summer Session  including those in the study abroad programs  will abide by the Honor Code
