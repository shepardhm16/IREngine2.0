Texas  but he has a big heart and it s filled with big ideas for action  So spending the summer in New York City on a Shepherd internship allowed him to act and fueled him with more ideas  The program  sponsored by the Shepherd Higher Education Consortium on Poverty  of which VMI is a member  sends cadets into impoverished areas of the country where they live on a small stipend for eight weeks and work within the community  Hudson lived on  14 a day in Brooklyn and commuted into the Bronx and mid town Manhattan where he worked with high school students   A lot of my kids were refugees  a lot of my kids were immigrants  and it s pulling them out of a mindset of   Well  we have it better here than we do in our own country  and putting them in the mindset of   It doesn t matter where you come from  you can still make it into the middle class  explained Hudson  The students were learning computer programming  but Hudson focused on teaching them professional development   It was how to professionally network  How do you interact in an office environment  Things that high schoolers don t necessarily get exposure to in the communities that we were serving  Normally  cadets must complete the Poverty and Human Capability course offered by Dr  Duncan Richter in the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  They then apply for the internship  interview with faculty  then interview with the Consortium  But  as Maj  Dorothy Hayden of VMI career services explained   This year we tried something different by opening the internship selection process to cadets who had not taken the course  but had an interest in serving in an impoverished community  Cadet Hudson was interviewed by a panel of faculty members and was competitively selected for the internship  Hudson  who is a psychology major  got the idea of applying for the internship from his academic adviser  Lt  Col  Keith Kline   I love the idea of providing a service to the fellow man  like VMI the citizen solider    so this was an opportunity to scale that up a thousandfold  Hudson said  The Shepherd Program is just the beginning for Hudson  He plans to join the Peace Corps after graduation  And he would like to start his own non profit  one that takes students out of the one mile radius they have probably never left and puts them in leadership situations far from home  He believes solving poverty problems will not only benefit those afflicted by poverty  but the entire country   The single most untapped natural resource in our country is the impoverished  The skills  the ingenuity  the intelligence  all of these things that we have access to through a good school system  through good jobs   if we can take that and apply that to the impoverished  we could advance society in ways that we can t even imagine in a very short amount of time  Hudson learned a great deal from his experience to say the least  But he believes the program benefited him a fraction of the amount it benefited the students he helped   One of the things I m taking away more than anything is the idea that poverty is not necessarily about giving people on the street corner money or giving them education  he said   It s about giving them an experience so they can educate themselves  I feel like that s the solution to urban poverty    Kelly Nye Cabell Willis  14 reflects on his Shepherd
