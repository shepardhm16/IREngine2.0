24450 Calculus e Textbook Is First in a Series Institute Report  October 2012  A VMI mathematics professor has come up with a unique solution to two problems with calculus textbooks  their expense and their inability to explain complex concepts well  Lt  Col  Greg Hartman has written his own electronic textbook for the Institute s introductory calculus course  Calculus 123  He is now in the process of writing a second book for the next level of study  Calculus 124  and plans to write a third volume in the spring for Calculus 215  The project is named APEX  an acronum which stands for  affordable print and electronic textbook   You re never completely satisfied with any textbook  said Hartman in explaining his decision to create his own book   Most of them are pretty good  but there s always things you d like to tweak here and there  He added that the expense of a typical calculus textbook   over  200  is daunting to many cadets  Cadets enrolled in Calculus 123 at VMI this fall  the first to use Harman s book  are given access to a PDF file containing Hartman s book  They then have the option of printing pages for free in the VMI s computer lab or loading the e book onto their laptop computers and bringing them to class  A third option is to buy a print copy of the book from Amazon com for the very reasonable price of  6 98  Hartman was quick to point out that Amazon s price covers only the cost of printing   neither he nor VMI profits from these sales  Many cadets like the print edition  Hartman said  because it has wide margins and lots of white space   perfect for making notes and working the problems in the book  Hartman began teaching at VMI in the fall of 2005  and came up with the idea for writing his own textbook shortly thereafter  It was a case in which necessity truly became the mother of invention  Hartman was preparing to teach a course in matrix algebra  but he realized that the  120 cost of the book was steep and the material was too advanced for the cadets  Feeling uncomfortable about asking cadets to purchase a book they wouldn t use much  Hartman decided to ditch the book and type up his own lecture notes instead  As the material he was typing ran on to 80 pages  Hartman had an epiphany   Wait a minute  he thought   I have more than just lecture notes here  I have a book being formed  Hartman s lecture notes for matrix algebra wound up as an e textbook and paved the way for the calculus e textbooks to follow  Finding time to write the e books for calculus proved elusive  though  until the spring of 2012  when Hartman was awarded a Jackson Hope Grant  Over the course of the project  Hartman was assisted by two co authors  Col  Troy Siemers  chair of VMI s mathematics department  and Brian Heinold  a math professor at Mount St  Mary s College in Maryland  The book was edited by Jennifer Bowen  a member of the faculty at the College of Wooster  With the first volume in use  the second on the drawing board  and the third in the planning stages  Hartman is already envisioning what he d like to do eventually  develop an i Pad app for calculus  so cadets could explore the complexities of calculus on their own   We d like to make it interactive over time  he said  With an endowment goal of  50 million  the Jackson Hope Fund provides support for promising academic initiatives that might otherwise languish in competition
