institutional effectiveness initiatives  Answering this question is accomplished through cyclic assessment activities at all levels of the Institute s operations  with particular emphasis given to educational programs  administrative support units  and academic and student support services  By measuring the extent to which identified outcomes in each of these three areas  and units within these areas  are achieved  we are able to make inferences about overall institutional effectiveness  This information is then used to determine if changes are needed in operations  e g  curriculum  pedagogy  or services offered  Once the changes are implemented  we again assess their effectiveness  and so on  Figure 1 below depicts this effectiveness cycle  Figure 1  Institutional Effectiveness Cycle Assessment   Accreditation Assessment is important  It requires administrators  faculty  and staff to thoughtfully consider what they are trying to achieve though the identification of expected outcomes  Once identified  these outcomes are assessed with an appropriate metric  e g  rubric  multiple choice test  or survey  which leads to evidence based decision making  This ongoing cycle of planning  assessing  and closing the loop ensures that we take time to reflect on what we ve done  how well we ve done it  and how we might make improvements  VMI s accrediting body  the Southern Association of Schools Commission on Colleges  believes so strongly in the value of this process that it requires member institutions to demonstrate continuous improvement in educational programs  administrative support services  and academic and student support services  Specifically  SACSCOC requires that institutions document that campus units  e g  a program major or academic service  identify expected outcomes  assess the extent to which they achieve those outcomes  and provide evidence of improvement based on data gathered in the assessment  For more information  please see
