making it miserable  added Vaughan  Cadets spent their nights in the field sleeping out under the stars   no tents  just waterproof sleeping bags   I would say that the hardest part for most people was the lack of sleep  he continued   People were lucky to get around four hours a night  most people   including myself and Gotwalt   averaged around two  While Bulldog Company was significantly smaller in number  it carried the day more often than not   They maneuvered almost perfectly  observed Gotwalt   The level that they re at right now is very impressive  After concluding operations at the detention center on Monday  the cadets were bused to the Chessie Trail and hiked the seven mile route back to post   The midshipmen appreciated the training they got  said Vaughan   Even though it was extremely hard and we pushed them to their limits  this morning during and after the hike they were still pretty motivated because they got to go out and do some really cool things this weekend  This year s spring FTX evolved from last spring s  in which cadets spent a brief amount of time at stations that required use of a specific concept  including force on force   That was our favorite part of FTX  last year  recalled Vaughan   So we made the entire FTX a force on force where you had to apply all your skills in a combat setting at one time   Every year we step it up a little bit
