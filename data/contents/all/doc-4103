purchased by Jackson as a gift for his wife and initially named  Fancy  this name was short lived  Jackson decided to keep the horse  and it was universally known as  Little Sorrel  Described as small  approximately 15 hands  and gaunt  but with remarkable powers of endurance  Little Sorrel remained Jackson s favorite and he was riding this horse when he was mortally wounded at Chancellorsville

wife ever mentioned Jackson had a particular penchant for lemons  and refers to the  lemon myth  It is true that Jackson was observed eating lemons on several occasions during the war  this was due
