painting course at VMI is offering cadets a fresh perspective on the visual arts  There s no textbook for the class  cadets are learning by creating art and discussing the process with their professor  Maj  Julie Brown  who is in her second semester teaching in the Department of English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  The class requires rigorous work in and out of the classroom  with three drawings required each week in addition to the painting projects   It s pretty much all hands on art  said Brown   I told them in the beginning that they need to allot time for the course  There may not be assigned reading  but there are assigned drawings and there s definitely time devoted outside of class to getting paintings finished  Cadets are entering the course with varied levels of experience   When they come into the course there s no prerequisite or requirement as far as their draftsmanship or knowledge of art  said Brown   They just have to be enthusiastic  and they are that  Despite the challenging nature of the course  cadets are finding the work rewarding   It s been a lot of fun but also very frustrating  as I want to paint as well as I can but it s not as easy as it looks  said Nicole Harding  14   It s been one of the more unique classes I ve had here  I m glad I ve had an opportunity to take a class like this my final semester here  Maj  Brown brings a lot to the class and my experience here that I never would have expected to enjoy at a military school  The painting course is part of the ERHS department s new curriculum  which includes the visual and literary arts   One of the things I really love and value about our curriculum is how integrated it is  said Brown  who is an expert in painting  graphic design  creative writing  and poetry   This is a place where I can finally engage and experiment with all these disciplines  The painting assignments are designed to bring out the cadets  creativity by asking them to paint within required parameters   Having all choices available at all times is not necessarily the easiest thing  There are burdens that come with that  said Brown   If you place constraints  then you have this set of rules to fight and push back against and you come up with interesting solutions because of that tension  Exploration of the creative process is one of the primary goals of the course   I want them to have some competency in draftsmanship   the translation of 3D objects into 2D space   but that s in the service of their own personal vision and expression  said Brown  One obstacle cadets are overcoming is separating their perception of  an object from the visual reality behind that perception   What I m trying to help them do is disrupt that top down process of perception  Our brains tell us what shape a thing is because we already know it  said Brown   It s about getting past what we abstractly and conceptually think about the world and actually seeing it for what it is  The cadets will attempt to see themselves for what they are by painting self portraits later this semester   One of the challenges there is that people think they know what they look like  It s such a familiar thing  but you really don t until you go through the process of representing it  said Brown  Brown is hoping cadets will find their own creative style by the end of the semester   What makes something unique or special or original is taking the circuitry that you have in your brain and filtering the world through it  Brown  Critique is an important part of the course that tests cadets  understanding of painting theory and their ability to communicate about their artwork   They re learning to use language in a particular way so that the criticisms can be heard and used  said Brown   They have to learn to articulate these principles of design and communicate with each other  Brown is planning collaboration between the painting course and her poetry course   They ll incorporate that or respond to it in some way in their multimedia painting  said Brown   And  in reverse  the poets will choose one of the paintings and respond to that painting with a poem  Brown is planning to bring students from both courses together toward the end of the semester for an art show where they ll share these works in addition to other work they ve done  By  John Robertson IV IR   April 2014
