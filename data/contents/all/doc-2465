Academics   Areas of Study   Social Science   Physical Education   New First Year Course Teaches Wellness New First Year Course Teaches Wellness Physical education faculty members are teaching the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in a new first year course  Wellness Concepts  which is required for all incoming cadets  The course emphasizes the importance of exercise  nutrition  and lifestyle and how that pertains to life at VMI and beyond   That s what VMI is all about  developing the mind and the body  said Col  James Coale  head of physical education   Getting this experience early on in their cadetships helps the rats understand a lot of what they re going through  The course gives new cadets a new perspective on the physical and mental rigors of the Rat Line   There s so much going on at VMI  said Coale   The stress can eat you up  and how you interpret and respond to it as a rat is important  Throughout the semester  cadets in the class work on a behavior change project  in which they target an area of life to improve and keep a log to track their progress   A lot of cadets benefited from that project  said Lt  Col  Mike Krackow  associate professor of physical education in his first year at VMI   I had students work on exercise  nutrition  time  management  and sleeping habits  Many saw positive changes throughout the semester  In order to encourage participation and engagement  class sizes are kept small  with a maximum of 20 students per section  To accommodate the entire rat class  13 sections were offered in the fall and 11 are being taught this spring by several members of the department s faculty   I make the course as interactive as possible  said Krackow   We re taking the knowledge and skills and tying them into the mindset of VMI  relating them to everything that they have going on  Since cadets are required to maintain a high level of fitness while at the Institute  the course focuses on why this fitness is important and how cadets can integrate fitness into their lives after VMI   Not only are members of the Corps physically fit  but they understand the role that fitness and nutrition play in their quality of life  said Coale   and they carry that legacy on with them after they leave VMI  To this end  instructors are using familiar examples to educate cadets   One exercise that I have my students do is to choose their favorite fast food meals  and calculate the calories  fat  and nutritional value  said Krackow   A lot of them are surprised at how unhealthy those meals can be  Overall  cadets seem to value the course s content   We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of positive feedback we got from cadets when we did the assessment of the fall semester  said Coale   We re going to continue to assess it for years to come and make changes based on the needs of cadets  The fall survey  for example  indicated a desire for greater emphasis on exercise program development  and that change is already in place this semester   I always tell students that the best exercise program is one that you can stick to  said Krackow  The course is teaching the basics of exercise and helping cadets to develop exercise programs based on their personal goals   The wellness course will continue to change based on the responses of cadets  so we re developing a course that is tailor made to the needs of cadets  said Krackow  By  John Robertson IV Lt  Col  Mike Kracko IR   April 2013 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health

Social Science   Physical Education   New First Year Course Teaches Wellness New First Year Course Teaches Wellness Physical education faculty members are teaching the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle in a new first year course  Wellness Concepts  which is required for all incoming cadets  The course emphasizes the importance of exercise  nutrition  and lifestyle and how that pertains to life at VMI and beyond   That s what VMI is all about  developing the mind and the body  said Col  James Coale  head of physical education   Getting this experience early on in their cadetships helps the rats understand a lot of what they re going through  The course gives new cadets a new perspective on the physical and mental rigors of the Rat Line   There s so much going on at VMI  said Coale   The stress can eat you up  and how you interpret and respond to it as a rat is important  Throughout the semester  cadets in the class work on a behavior change project  in which they target an area of life to improve and keep a log to track their progress   A lot of cadets benefited from that project  said Lt  Col  Mike Krackow  associate professor of physical education in his first year at VMI   I had students work on exercise  nutrition  time  management  and sleeping habits  Many saw positive changes throughout the semester  In order to encourage participation and engagement  class sizes are kept small  with a maximum of 20 students per section  To accommodate the entire rat class  13 sections were offered in the fall and 11 are being taught this spring by several members of the department s faculty   I make the course as interactive as possible  said Krackow   We re taking the knowledge and skills and tying them into the mindset of VMI  relating them to everything that they have going on  Since cadets are required to maintain a high level of fitness while at the Institute  the course focuses on why this fitness is important and how cadets can integrate fitness into their lives after VMI   Not only are members of the Corps physically fit  but they understand the role that fitness and nutrition play in their quality of life  said Coale   and they carry that legacy on with them after they leave VMI  To this end  instructors are using familiar examples to educate cadets   One exercise that I have my students do is to choose their favorite fast food meals  and calculate the calories  fat  and nutritional value  said Krackow   A lot of them are surprised at how unhealthy those meals can be  Overall  cadets seem to value the course s content   We were pleasantly surprised at the amount of positive feedback we got from cadets when we did the assessment of the fall semester  said Coale   We re going to continue to assess it for years to come and make changes based on the needs of cadets  The fall survey  for example  indicated a desire for greater emphasis on exercise program development  and that change is already in place this semester   I always tell students that the best exercise program is one that you can stick to  said Krackow  The course is teaching the basics of exercise and helping cadets to develop exercise programs based on their personal goals   The wellness course will continue to change based on the responses of cadets  so we re developing a course that is tailor made to the needs of cadets  said
