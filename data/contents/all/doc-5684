Challenge for U S  AFRICOM Maj  Gen  Donald Christopher Leins gives a keynote address   Photo courtesy of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2011   One of the challenges facing U S  policymakers regarding Africa is that  we don t really know what Chinese intentions are  what their goals are  and what they hope to achieve  said Maj  Gen  Donald Christopher Leins  deputy director for politico military affairs  Africa  at the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Leins delivered a keynote address at VMI s  The Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  conference on Nov  3  speaking of challenges as well as opportunities for the United States over the next few decades as it tries to map out a strategy to promote development and secure its interests in Africa  During a time of budget constraints and shrinking resources  Leins said  it is critical for the U S  to cultivate partnerships in Africa   Should China be one of those partners  Leins asked  referencing a  lack of transparency  among other issues  that makes it difficult for the United States to discern whether Chinese motivations are  altruistic or neo colonial  In the past  for example  China had been critical of many peace keeping missions as constituting a violation of sovereignty  However  in recent years China has itself become involved in more operations  Leins said  citing humanitarian efforts in Darfur and Sudan undertaken by China  in addition to Chinese efforts to stem piracy off the Somali coast  Leins also spoke of the challenges and activities of the newly formed Africa Command  AFRICOM  headquartered in Stuttgart  Germany  AFRICOM  which is one of six Department of Defense regional military headquarters  assists African militaries in developing security strategies for defense and anti terrorism  Leins said the ongoing economic recession has forced the Africa Command to focus on hotspots such as Somalia  Libya and Ethiopia  and Nigeria  AFRICOM personnel stationed in Africa contend with poisonous snakes  malaria  and other infectious diseases  as well as the logistics of operating on a continent three times the size of the United States  Leins said  In addition to the challenges facing the U S  and China in Africa  Leins also spoke of opportunities  The success of U S  and Chinese operations to stem piracy in Somalia is but one area of common interest that could give way to future cooperation on  transnational  concerns such as illegal drug trafficking  natural disaster response  pandemics  and elimination of weapons of mass destruction  All of which over the next two decades might spell opportunity for cadets who are interested in international relations   We don t have a deep bench of experts on Africa  which is something for you

a keynote address   Photo courtesy of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2011   One of the challenges facing U S  policymakers regarding Africa is that  we don t really know what Chinese intentions are  what their goals are  and what they hope to achieve  said Maj  Gen  Donald Christopher Leins  deputy director for politico military affairs  Africa  at the Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  Leins delivered a keynote address at VMI s  The Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  conference on Nov  3  speaking of challenges as well as opportunities for the United States over the next few decades as it tries to map out a strategy to promote development and secure its interests in Africa  During a time of budget constraints and shrinking resources  Leins said  it is critical for the U S  to cultivate partnerships in Africa   Should China be one of those partners  Leins asked  referencing a  lack of transparency  among other issues  that makes it difficult for the United States to discern whether Chinese motivations are  altruistic or neo colonial  In the past  for example  China had been critical of many peace keeping missions as constituting a violation of sovereignty  However  in recent years China has itself become involved in more operations  Leins said  citing humanitarian efforts in Darfur and Sudan undertaken by China  in addition to Chinese efforts to stem piracy off the Somali coast  Leins also spoke of the challenges and activities of the newly formed Africa Command  AFRICOM  headquartered in Stuttgart  Germany  AFRICOM  which is one of six Department of Defense regional military headquarters  assists African militaries in developing security strategies for defense and anti terrorism  Leins said the ongoing economic recession has forced the Africa Command to focus on hotspots such as Somalia  Libya and Ethiopia  and Nigeria  AFRICOM personnel stationed in Africa contend with poisonous snakes  malaria  and other infectious diseases  as well as the logistics of operating on a continent three times the size of the United States  Leins said  In addition to the challenges facing the U S  and China in Africa  Leins also spoke of opportunities  The success of U S  and Chinese operations to stem piracy in Somalia is but one area of common interest that could give way to future cooperation on  transnational  concerns such as illegal drug trafficking  natural disaster response  pandemics  and elimination of weapons of mass destruction  All of which over the next two decades might spell opportunity for cadets who are interested in international relations   We don t have a deep bench of experts on Africa  which is something for you all to think about  Leins said to cadets in the audience   I challenge all of
