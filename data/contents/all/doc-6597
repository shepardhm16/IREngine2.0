Chinese Language Program If they re listening closely  passers by in Scott Shipp Hall this fall will hear the sound of a language never before taught at VMI  Mandarin Chinese  Newly arrived at VMI for the 2014 15 academic year  Dr  Peng Xu and Dr  Lunpeng Ma  both assistant professors of modern languages and cultures  are each teaching three sections of Chinese 101 this semester  with plans to progress to Chinese 102 in the spring and add intermediate and advanced Chinese language courses as the program grows  In addition  the two professors  both natives of China  are planning to add courses aimed at helping cadets understand and appreciate the rich cultural history of the world s most populous nation  To further enhance cadet opportunities  a study abroad program in Shanghai has just been approved for the summer of 2015  Adding a Chinese language program had been a goal in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures for many years  explained Col  Kathleen Bulger Barnett  department head   It was a question of demand  said Bulger Barnett of the decision to drop Japanese  which had been taught by a single part time instructor  and add Chinese in its place   Prospective cadets and current cadets and members of the Board of Visitors had been asking for Chinese for a long time  She added that in years past  some cadets would take Chinese language classes at neighboring Washington and Lee University  but that school s academic calendar and VMI s usually don t mesh well  In addition  she noted  many members of the faculty in other departments  including history  economics and business  and international studies  teach courses having to do with East Asia  and they felt that Chinese language classes would complement their offerings  In the history department  Col  Mark Wilkinson teaches a course on China in the early 20th century  while Dr  Luman Wang  newly hired this year  teaches one course on the imperial era in China  up to 1911  and another on the Communist era in China since 1949  In the international studies department  Lt  Col  Howard Sanborn IV teaches a class in Chinese politics  Both Ma and Xu expressed appreciation for the fact that the study of Chinese history and politics is not new to the Institute   This is a very good foundation to broaden students  knowledge  said Xu   I sometimes see myself as being added into this intellectual pool  Ma added   We re creating a Chinese scholar community here  With input from China scholars in the various departments  plus Ma and Xu  a proposal to add an Asian studies minor is also in the works  Meanwhile  the two new professors come to VMI with differing skill sets  but a shared enthusiasm for teaching the language and culture of their native land   I m excited about the opportunity to start up a new program  said Xu  who obtained her bachelor s and master s degrees from Peking University and her doctorate from the University of Chicago  Xu specializes in pre modern Chinese literature and cultural history  with a special emphasis on traditional Chinese drama  A classically trained opera singer  Xu gave an evening presentation   Chinese Opera and the Chinese Language  on Oct  30 as part of her effort to spur an interest in Chinese culture  In the spring  she s proposing to teach Chinese Strategic Culture  a course examining Chinese military tactics through reading The Art of War by Sun Tzu  a legendary figure in ancient Chinese military history  Ma comes to VMI with specialties in modern Chinese culture  new media  and film  In the spring  he is planning to offer a course on Chinese martial arts in film  He earned his bachelor s and master s degrees at Shanghai Jiaotong University  and his doctorate at Stony Brook University  So far  Xu and Ma have found that their skill sets mesh well together  With complementary backgrounds   We can collaborate together and offer more courses for our cadets  Ma noted  Both Spoken and Written Chinese Present Challenges for Cadets This fall  47 cadets are enrolled in first sections of Chinese 101 ever offered at VMI  The cadets came to the class with different backgrounds and chose to study the language for different reasons  One factor  though  seems to unite them  a desire to step outside of their linguistic comfort zones and persevere  Cadet Robert Elmore  16 chose to study Chinese for two reasons   one was the desire to support a new language program at VMI  since new programs need enrollment  Secondly  Elmore plans to commission in the Navy  with plans to work in the space industry after serving in the military   One of the top world space programs behind NASA is the China National Space Administration  so learning some basics in the language couldn t hurt if we re looking at potentially working with them in the future  he explained  Like many of his fellow students  Elmore has found both pronunciation and writing to be a challenge   Using inflection in your voice can raise emphasis on a word or be used to ask a question in English  he explained   However  changing the tone of your voice in Chinese can literally be the difference between saying   Mom  or saying   horse  Writing the language  which involves drawing a complex series of characters  has its own set of difficulties   The challenge there is not only having to memorize a new  picture  for every word  but being able to draw them correctly  as an extra dash or line here or there will change what you are trying to say entirely  said Elmore  Despite these challenges  Elmore plans to push on until he attains fluency in speech and mastery in writing   The most enjoyable part for me is probably just practicing Chinese with my peers or even my native Chinese speaking friends here at VMI  he said   Being able to communicate with someone in a way that no one else around you can understand is rewarding in its own way  and when I get good enough to have full conversations it will be even cooler  Like Elmore  Cadet Matthew Kenkel  18 has found writing Chinese characters a tough assignment  To master this skill  he s taking one of the oldest approaches in the book  practice makes perfect   I quickly found out that the best way for me to memorize them is to write them down over and over again  said Kenkel   I usually spend a good portion of my study time every night in Preston Library writing out characters  Coming into VMI this fall  Kenkel declared a major in modern languages and cultures  with a concentration in Chinese  making him one of two cadets to choose such a major so far  He s considering a career in military intelligence and would like to study abroad in China  Coming to the Chinese class with an entirely different background has been Cadet Jae Song  17  a native of Korea who lived in that nation until he was 12 years old  He took Japanese classes both in high school and at VMI until that language was discontinued at the Institute this year  For Song  Asian language fluency is a priority because he s planning on commissioning in the Air Force  with hopes of being stationed in East Asia  Unlike the majority of his classmates  Song has found writing Chinese characters to be the easy part   I am very familiar with Chinese characters because Chinese characters are taught in Korean schools  Song explained   Koreans incorporate Chinese characters in print media  dictionaries  and personal names  Although I have forgotten many since I moved into the U S  I am picking up very quickly  Also seeking Chinese fluency for career reasons is Cadet Ryan Titzer  16   I came to VMI with the intent to minor in Chinese in order to supplement my major in computer science  said Titzer  who plans to work in the cybersecurity field and believes the language will be an asset in that endeavor  Like most of his fellow cadets  Titzer has found writing the Chinese characters hard to learn  but as the weeks have gone by  what once seemed impossible has gotten easier   I think it s awesome when I m writing in Chinese and look down to see a bunch of characters that I can actually make sense out of  Titzer noted  By  Mary Price IR   Nov  2014 VMI Foundation
