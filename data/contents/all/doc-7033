designed and constructed for use with the 0 5 meter  f 13 5 Cassegrain telescope at the VMI observatory 1 The polarimeter is based on the common dual beam design and utilizes a rotatable half wave plate and Wollaston prism to image starlight onto a CCD detector after passing through a broadband  or narrowband  filter  The usable field of view is approximately 10 arcminutes and the operational range of the instrument is 400 nm   700 nm  A cross section of our polarimeter is shown in the figure to the right  The achromatic half wave plate  HWP  from Karl Lambrecht Corporation is a 22 mm diameter  magnesium fluoride crystalline quartz double plate retarder  optimized for a wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm  It is housed in a compact motorized rotation stage  Thorlabs  that has a resolution of 1 arcsecond  The Wollaston quartz prism  WP  from Bernhard Halle Nachfl  GmbH has a usable spectral range from 0 23 to 2 8  m and a   degree divergence angle  It has a 30 x 30 mm cross section and is mounted in a coupling tube that connects the rotation stage to a filter wheel  Apogee  that contains Johnson Cousins as well as narrowband filters  The filter wheel is connected to an Alta U6 CCD camera from Apogee which uses a Kodak KAF 1001E CCD imaging sensor  The imaging area of the sensor is 24 6 mm x 24 6 mm with 24  m square pixels in a 1024 x 1024 array  Images are obtained with MaxIm DL and aperture photometry is performed to measure the flux of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the star on the CCD detector  From these measurements  normalized Stokes parameters are obtained that are used to calculate the degree of polarization and position angle referenced to the line of constant right ascension on the plane of the sky  The table below lists measurements of standard polarized stars obtained using the broadband V filter during the testing of the instrument  Also listed are weighted averages of published measurements taken over different time periods by other various astronomers  The last two columns indicate the differences in the degree of polarization and position angle  An analysis using unpolarized standards indicates an instrumental polarization on the order of and less than 0 05  Measuring the polarization state of starlight can yield information about the interstellar medium  ISM  the nature and environment around certain stars  and the magnetic field in our local region of the galaxy  For example  one mechanism that can polarize light is selective extinction  As its name implies  polarization by selective extinction results from the extinction of light whose electric vector is in some preferred orientation  Suppose unpolarized light  which has no preferred orientation of its electric vector  is incident on a solid dust grain in the ISM  If the dust grain is spherical  the scattered light will be partially polarized only at angles away from the propagation direction  If the grain is not spherically symmetric  the unpolarized light will suffer polarization by selective extinction in the direction of propagation  since the electric vector that is parallel to the grain s long axis suffers greater extinction than if it were perpendicular to the long axis  Now  if the non spherical grains were randomly oriented in a region of the ISM  a net polarization is not expected   superposition would tend to randomize the electric vectors  However  in 1949 Hiltner2 and Hall3 showed that observations of solar type stars do show polarization  Since solar type stars have very little dust in their immediate vicinity and their intrinsic polarization is extremely small  the most probable and widely accepted origin of the observed polarization is due to aspherical dust grains that have a net statistical alignment of their long axes in a preferred direction in the ISM  Additionally  observations of polarization of starlight have shown that the polarization vectors  when projected onto the plane of the sky  show a strong correlation with the galactic magnetic field  measured by Faraday rotation or the Zeeman Effect for example  as well as a correlation with the reddening of stars  Therefore  there exists a mechanism by which non spherical dust grains can be aligned such that selective extinction creates polarization predominately in the direction of the galactic magnetic field  This can be accomplished if the aspherical grains are spinning with the long axis perpendicular to the galactic magnetic field  1 G  A  Topasna  D  M  Topasna  G  B  Popko   An Easily Designed and Constructed Optical

 Astronomical Research Astronomical Research Astronomical research at VMI is focused on measuring the polarization of starlight  Recently  a polarimeter was designed and constructed for use with the 0 5 meter  f 13 5 Cassegrain telescope at the VMI observatory 1 The polarimeter is based on the common dual beam design and utilizes a rotatable half wave plate and Wollaston prism to image starlight onto a CCD detector after passing through a broadband  or narrowband  filter  The usable field of view is approximately 10 arcminutes and the operational range of the instrument is 400 nm   700 nm  A cross section of our polarimeter is shown in the figure to the right  The achromatic half wave plate  HWP  from Karl Lambrecht Corporation is a 22 mm diameter  magnesium fluoride crystalline quartz double plate retarder  optimized for a wavelength range from 400 to 700 nm  It is housed in a compact motorized rotation stage  Thorlabs  that has a resolution of 1 arcsecond  The Wollaston quartz prism  WP  from Bernhard Halle Nachfl  GmbH has a usable spectral range from 0 23 to 2 8  m and a   degree divergence angle  It has a 30 x 30 mm cross section and is mounted in a coupling tube that connects the rotation stage to a filter wheel  Apogee  that contains Johnson Cousins as well as narrowband filters  The filter wheel is connected to an Alta U6 CCD camera from Apogee which uses a Kodak KAF 1001E CCD imaging sensor  The imaging area of the sensor is 24 6 mm x 24 6 mm with 24  m square pixels in a 1024 x 1024 array  Images are obtained with MaxIm DL and aperture photometry is performed to measure the flux of the ordinary and extraordinary images of the star on the CCD detector  From these measurements  normalized Stokes parameters are obtained that are used to calculate the degree of polarization and position angle referenced to the line of constant right ascension on the plane of the sky  The table below lists measurements of standard polarized stars obtained using the broadband V filter during the testing of the instrument  Also listed are weighted averages of published measurements taken over different time periods by other various astronomers  The last two columns indicate the differences in the degree of polarization and position angle  An analysis using unpolarized standards indicates an instrumental polarization on the order of and less than 0 05  Measuring the polarization state of starlight can yield information about the interstellar medium  ISM  the nature and environment around certain stars  and the magnetic field in our local region of the galaxy  For example  one mechanism that can polarize light is selective extinction  As its name implies  polarization by selective extinction results from the extinction of light whose electric vector is in some preferred orientation  Suppose unpolarized light  which has no preferred orientation of its electric vector  is incident on a solid dust grain in the ISM  If the dust grain is spherical  the scattered light will be partially polarized only at angles away from the propagation direction  If the grain is not spherically symmetric  the unpolarized light will suffer polarization by selective extinction in the direction of propagation  since the electric vector that is parallel to the grain s long axis suffers greater extinction than if it were perpendicular to the long axis  Now  if the non spherical grains were randomly oriented in a region of the ISM  a net polarization is not expected   superposition would tend to randomize the electric vectors  However  in 1949 Hiltner2 and Hall3 showed that observations of solar type stars do show polarization  Since solar type stars have very little dust in their immediate vicinity and their intrinsic polarization is extremely small  the most probable and widely accepted origin of the observed polarization is due to aspherical dust grains that have a net statistical alignment of their long axes in a preferred direction in the ISM  Additionally  observations of polarization of starlight have shown that the polarization vectors  when projected onto the plane of the sky  show a strong correlation with the galactic magnetic field  measured by Faraday rotation or the Zeeman Effect for example  as well as a correlation with the reddening of stars  Therefore  there exists a mechanism by which non spherical dust grains can be aligned such that selective extinction creates polarization predominately in the direction of the galactic magnetic field  This can be accomplished if the aspherical grains are spinning with the long axis perpendicular to the galactic magnetic field  1 G  A  Topasna  D  M  Topasna  G  B  Popko   An Easily Designed and Constructed Optical Polarimeter for Small Telescopes
