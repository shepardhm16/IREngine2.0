1859 Order No 237 In anticipation of orders from the Governor for the services of a portion of the Corps of Cadets on special duty at or near Charles Town  Virginia  those cadets who have been detailed for such service will hold themselves in readiness to take up the line of march at a moment s notice  The Corps of Cadets will be under the command of Major Gilham  who will have his command in readiness for the special services of infantry troops  The artillery detachment will be under the command of Major Jackson  who will be prepared specially for the use of Howitzers  Majors Preston and Colston will accompany the Superintendent as part of his special staff  The Superintendent need scarcely say to those detailed for this important service that there never was a time in the history of the State when more prudence  judgment  and fidelity were demanded than at this moment  He implicitly confides in the cadets that they will promptly discharge every duty and obey every command  that they will abstain from all thoughtless levity and from all forms of indiscretion and immorality and that they will remember that called into service for duty as men they will acquit themselves like men and as true sons of a common mother  His own word stands pledged for this  He looks to each and every one to redeem it  It is important for the order as well as efficiency of the Institution that the regular duties may proceed with as little interruption as possible  A moment s reflection will show the necessity of this  Let no boisterous noise be heard at any time and let those who remain on duty at the Institute remember that their duty at home is a trust also  in which their fidelity may be tried at any moment  Be faithful to all duties and especially on the alert for night guard duty  The recitations will be regularly kept up  but lessons will be so regulated as to impose light burdens upon the student  Special orders have been given to the Commandant of Cadets for insuring due protection to the public property  By order of Col  Smith Head Quarters Va Military Institute Nov 23d 1859 12 1 2 p m  Order No 243 I  The following telegraphic dispatch has been recd

Charles Town  VA  Nov 28th  1859 Order No  2 I  Cadets are authorized to leave their Barracks between the hours of the established roll calls  But they will not pass beyond the limits of the town without special authority  and no cadet will be absent from quarters after retreat at 6 PM  It is expected that the detachment of cadets on duty here will be a model command   it is hoped that every officer and cadet will consider himself in the solemn sanctions of honor bound to abstain from impropriety which could by possibility impair the standing of the corps occupying so proud a position in the command of the state  The eye of the military of the state is turned with peculiar interest to every act a movement of the cadets  Let that criticism only tend to exhibit in their highest proportion all the elements of a true soldier  By order of Col Smith R E  Colston Act Adjt  Head Quarters  Va  Military Inst  Charles Town Va  Nov 28th 1859 Order No 3 I  Besides the regular detail for the general guard a special detail for a quarter guard of one commissioned officer and 6 privates will be made  II  No cadet shall at any time enter the commissary s department  or the kitchen

non commissioned officers will be detailed and mounted on for duty tonight  The cadets will be relieved from the picket guard tonight  Every cadet will have his musket in perfect firing order  for inspection this evening at 3 1 2 o clock and 12 rounds of ball cartridges in good order in his cartridge box  The cadets will lie down in their clothes and accoutrements with their arms loaded by their sides to be ready at a moments warning for any emergency tonight  By order of Col Smith R E  Colston Act Adjt  HQ  VMI   Lexington  Dec 12th  1859 Order No 245 The commanding officer of the detachment of cadets on duty at Charles Town deems it his duty to tender to the officers and cadets engaged in this special service his thanks for the cheerful alacrity with which they have one and all met the duties to which they were so suddenly called  It is no slight praise to receive the commendation of the Governor so publicly  and so honorably expressed in his annual message  but when this is associated with the spontaneous sentiments of the citizen soldiery collected at Charles Town  and responded to by the approbation of the public at large  This command has real cause of honest pride  that they have been able to render the state some service  and in doing so  have demonstrated the value of the Institution as the chief dependence of the state in time of trial  The Institution has been placed in great prominence by the service thus proffered and it should be the aim of all to make it more and more worthy of confidence and support  By order of Col  Smith VMI Foundation
