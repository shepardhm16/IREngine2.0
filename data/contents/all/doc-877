Eating Issues Nutrition and Healthy Eating While college is a great time for students to learn to make healthy eating and lifestyle choices independently of family influences  it can also be a time that is difficult to navigate  Common concerns that can surface are negative body image  weight maintenance  proper nutrition for athletes  and eating disorders  Eating disorders can appear in all types of people  male and female  overweight or skinny  athlete or non athlete and can effect VMI cadets as easily as any other college in America  Eating disorders are non discriminatory  what characterizes them is an unhealthy relationship with food  body weight  and self perception  Eating disorders are not always just about food and body weight  Just as an individual may turn to anger to cover a more serious problem such as depression  a cadet  can use food as a coping mechanism to deal with difficult emotions or situations  or to help them re gain control when feeling overwhelmed  Continuum of Disordered Eating  Healthy behavior begins at the top with healthy eating habits and step by step progress shows different levels of concern all the way into disordered eating habits and distorted body image   Where do you fall along this continuum  What about your friends  There are three main categories of eating disorders  Anorexia Nervosa  Bulimia Nervosa  and Binge Eating Disorder  Anorexia Nervosa  AN  Anorexia is characterized by an intense fear of weight gain  a distortion of body image  a relentless pursuit of thinness as well as an unwillingness or inability to maintain a normal or healthy body weight  In females it presents with amenorrhea  absence of menstruation  A person who develops anorexia will often become obsessive about eating  food  and weight control  Frequently checking body weight  careful control of food portions  and food restrictions are common with this disorder  Often an individual with anorexia believes they are overweight  even though they may clearly appear poorly nourished or emaciated There are different types within the subcategory of Anorexia  Restrictive Type and Binge Eating Purging type  These types refer to the way in which the individual consumes food when they do eat   Warning Signs of Anorexia  Deliberate Food Restriction Fear of Gaining Weight Refusal to eat of incredibly restrictive eating Continuous Dieting Compulsive Exercise Abnormal Weight Loss Sensitivity to Cold Amenorrhea or irregular menstruation in females Increased facial hair body hair due to lack of protein in diet Hair Loss  on scalp  Bulimia Nervosa  BN  Individuals struggling with bulimia have similar concerns to those struggling with anorexia  But unlike anorexia  people with bulimia often fall within the normal range for their age and weight  Bulimia is characterized by frequent and recurring cycles of binging  eating atypically large amounts of food  followed by a period of purging  vomiting  overuse of laxatives or diuretics  The purge phase of bulimia is often in hopes to compensate for the binge behavior  and to help the individual feel they have regained control  This cycle typically repeats several times within one week  As with any eating disorder  there is often another underlying psychological illness  e g  depression  anxiety  and substance abuse  that accompanies bulimia nervosa  This behavior can have serious physical implication  including dental decay  gastrointestinal problems  and nutritional imbalances   Warning Signs of Bulimia Preoccupation with Food Binge Eating   secretive  Vomiting after bingeing Abuse of Laxatives  diuretics  and or diet pills Denial of Hunger Compulsive exercising Swollen salivary glands Broken blood vessels in the eyes  from purging  It is important to note  again  that individuals with bulimia may not appear to be under weight  In fact  they can range anywhere from overweight  normal weight  or underweight  For this reason  it can be more difficult to immediately identify bulimia in a friend or family member  Binge Eating Disorder  BED  While BED is not yet recognized in the DSM IV  it is proposed as a new addition to the DSM V Binge Eating Disorder is characterized by insatiable cravings that can occur at any point during the day or night  Thebehavior is usually secretive and filled with shame for the individual  It is estimated that BED occurs in1 out of every 35 adults in the U S  approximately 3 5  of women and 2  of men  It is also important to note that Binge Eating Disorder does not co occur with Anorexia or Bulimia  In BED  the individual does not purge after bingeing  so individuals with this disorder are more likely to be overweight   Proposed Criteria for BED Diagnosis  Loss of control of amount eating  Distress over binge episode Occurs at least 1 time per week for a 3 month period and  Eating more rapidly than normal Eating until feeling uncomfortably full Eating large amounts of food without feeling hungry Eating alone due to embarrassment Guilt after overeating  It is important to note that obesity and BED are not the same situation  Obesity exists as a medical illness  while BED is a psychiatric disorder and simply being overweight does not mean you have BED  Tweet About Us The Office of Cadet Counseling is available to help cadets capitalize on their strengths  as well as develop new skills
