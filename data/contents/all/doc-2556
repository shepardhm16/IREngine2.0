the students were approximately 90 teachers  The VMI sitting of the AMC8  a test administered by the Mathematical Association of America  is typically one of the largest in the United States  That American Mathematics Competition 8 is taken by more than 100 000 students each year   It s one of the most prestigious mathematics competitions  said Maj  Randy Cone  assistant professor of mathematics  who organized the event   For us  it s become a way to connect with our K through 12 colleagues    We ve turned the AMC into something more than a competition at VMI    We come together
