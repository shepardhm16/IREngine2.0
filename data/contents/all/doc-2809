VMI Class of 1961  Civil Rights Hero  Alumni Genealogy   Biography Home   Online Exhibit Photo Album  Daniels in Alabama  1965  About Jonathan Daniels Jonathan M  Daniels  a native of Keene  New Hampshire  was valedictorian of the VMI Class of 1961  He was awarded the prestigious Danforth Fellowship for post graduate study and enrolled at Harvard University to continue his study of English literature  Daniels soon realized that he was called to the ministry  While a seminarian at the Episcopal Divinity School in Cambridge  Massachusetts he responded to the pleas of Dr  Martin Luther King for clergy to become more actively involved in the Civil Rights movement  and traveled to Alabama to assist with voter registration efforts in the South  In August 1965 Daniels and 22 others were arrested for participating in a voter rights demonstration in Fort Deposit  Alabama  and transferred to the county jail in nearby Hayneville  Shortly after being released on August 20  Richard Morrisroe  a Catholic priest  and Daniels accompanied two black teenagers  Joyce Bailey and Ruby Sales  to a Hayneville store to buy a soda  They were met on the steps by Tom Coleman  a construction worker and part time deputy sheriff  who was carrying a shotgun  Coleman aimed his gun at sixteen year old Ruby Sales  Daniels pushed her to the ground in order to protect her  saving her life  The shotgun blast killed Daniels instantly  Morrisroe was seriously wounded  When he heard of the tragedy  Martin Luther King  Jr  said   One of the most heroic Christian deeds of which I have heard in my entire ministry was performed by Jonathan Daniels  In the years since his death  Daniels  selfless act has been recognized in many ways  Two books have been written about his life  and a documentary was produced in 1999  The Episcopal Church added the date of his death to its Calendar of Lesser Feasts and Fasts  and in England s Canterbury Cathedral  Daniels name is among the fifteen honored in the Chapel of Martyrs  Recognition at the Institute The VMI Board of Visitors voted in 1997 to establish the Jonathan M  Daniels  61 Humanitarian Award  The award emphasizes the virtue of humanitarian public service and recognizes individuals who have made significant personal sacrifices to protect or improve the lives of others  The inaugural presentation was made to President James Earl Carter in
