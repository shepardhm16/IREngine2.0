semester  Instead he was observing Veterans Day and Founders Day  reflecting on the service of many and the mission of the Institute  As chief of staff  Inman is aware of most everything that goes on  Chair of the Institute Planning Committee  he touches nearly everything that is reviewed or approved by the superintendent  Four administrative offices report directly to him  And cadets require his official attention when they re having trouble  For Inman  it feels  wonderful  to be back at VMI  to have this additional opportunity to serve his alma mater after a career of service in the Army  That career began soon after graduation  when Inman  as a lieutenant in the artillery  worked with Pershing nuclear missiles in Germany  As he moved up the ranks  Inman served in a range of positions   in the U S  Army Cadet Command  as part of the military delegation to NATO  and deployed to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan  In Iraq he was wounded when the enemy detonated a rigged 155 mm howitzer projectile just as his Humvee drove past  It occurred the day before Thanksgiving 2005  Inman doesn t recall any fear when he felt the crack like a baseball bat over his ankles  What he recalls is his concern for the other soldiers in the Humvee with him  Was the young soldier behind the M 240 machine gun in the open cupola OK  Was their convoy being overwatched by direct or indirect fire so that more injuries were likely  In the damaged vehicle  could the four others be gotten to safety  The Humvee pulled over a few hundred feet down the road  efforts to extricate Inman began  a medevac was called in  and less than 45 minutes later it was all over  He was safe in a Level I military hospital in Logistic Support Area Anaconda outside Balad  Iraq  Twenty four hours later he was in Germany and the next week  back in the United States  at Ft  Campbell  Ky  where he received most of his care  It was all over so fast   evidence of the extraordinary care received by U S  soldiers wounded in the field   but in a way that was one of the problems  Ultimately  his wounds led to the amputation of his right foot  Inman admits   I wish I still had a foot  but he adds immediately   it can always be worse  And what was most difficult for him was leaving his unit   I was a battalion commander  with 101st Airborne Division  I had been with that battalion for 19 months   and  I was pulled out instantaneously  I did not have an opportunity to even say goodbye  said Inman   That was tough  Inman s final active duty assignment was as commander of the National Capitol Region Warrior Transition Brigade at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda  Md  where he was responsible for all the nonmedical care for wounded  ill  and injured soldiers and their families   I found it very humbling to be able to observe  watch  help our men and women that have been wounded  said Inman   I found that by and large they were extraordinarily resilient  I ve seen quad amputees that within six weeks were changing the diapers on their toddler daughters    And they had wonderful senses of humor  It was  concluded Inman   really  really meaningful work  Inman s next stop was VMI and an opportunity to help guide the Institute as it teaches time honored values to a 21st century Corps of Cadets  He has much to share   I think the essence of being a leader is to selflessly serve others and to inspire them to attain a specific goal or achievement  reflected Inman  And VMI  he said   is still a Spartan  rigorous  tough  demanding four years that   produces a strong  resilient

s note  As VMI prepared to observe Founders Day and Veterans Day earlier this week  the Institute Report sat down with Col  Jamie Inman  86 to hear about his years of service and his reflections on the meaning of Veterans Day  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  13  2015   On Wednesday  Nov  11  Col  Jamie Inman  86 wasn t be leading an honors forum as he does most Wednesdays this semester  Instead he was observing Veterans Day and Founders Day  reflecting on the service of many and the mission of the Institute  As chief of staff  Inman is aware of most everything that goes on  Chair of the Institute Planning Committee  he touches nearly everything that is reviewed or approved by the superintendent  Four administrative offices report directly to him  And cadets require his official attention when they re having trouble  For Inman  it feels  wonderful  to be back at VMI  to have this additional opportunity to serve his alma mater after a career of service in the Army  That career began soon after graduation  when Inman  as a lieutenant in the artillery  worked with Pershing nuclear missiles in Germany  As he moved up the ranks  Inman served in a range of positions   in the U S  Army Cadet Command  as part of the military delegation to NATO  and deployed to war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan  In Iraq he was wounded when the enemy detonated a rigged 155 mm howitzer projectile just as his Humvee drove past  It occurred the day before Thanksgiving 2005  Inman doesn t recall any fear when he felt the crack like a baseball bat over his ankles  What he recalls is his concern for the other soldiers in the Humvee with him  Was the young soldier behind the M 240 machine gun in the open cupola OK  Was their convoy being overwatched by direct or indirect fire so that more injuries were likely  In the damaged vehicle  could the four others be gotten to safety  The Humvee pulled over a few hundred feet down the road  efforts to extricate Inman began  a medevac was called in  and less than 45 minutes later it was all over  He was safe in a Level I military hospital in Logistic Support Area Anaconda outside Balad  Iraq  Twenty four hours later he was in Germany and the next week  back in the United States  at Ft  Campbell  Ky  where he received most of his care  It was all over so fast   evidence of the extraordinary care received by U S  soldiers wounded in the field   but in a way that was one of the problems  Ultimately  his wounds led to the amputation of his right foot  Inman admits   I wish I still had a foot  but he adds immediately   it can always be worse  And what was most difficult for him was leaving his unit   I was a battalion commander  with 101st Airborne Division  I had been with that battalion for 19 months   and  I was pulled out instantaneously  I did not have an opportunity to even say goodbye  said Inman   That was tough  Inman s final active duty assignment was as commander of the National Capitol Region Warrior Transition Brigade at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda  Md  where he was responsible for all the nonmedical care for wounded  ill  and injured soldiers and their families   I found it very humbling to be able to observe  watch  help our men and women that have been wounded  said Inman   I found that by and large they were extraordinarily resilient  I ve seen quad amputees that within six weeks were changing the diapers on their toddler daughters    And they had wonderful senses of humor  It was  concluded Inman   really  really meaningful work  Inman s next stop was VMI and an opportunity to help guide the Institute as it teaches time honored values to a 21st century Corps of Cadets  He has much to share   I think the essence of being a leader is to selflessly serve others and to inspire them to attain a specific goal or achievement  reflected Inman  And VMI  he said   is still a Spartan  rigorous  tough  demanding four years that   produces a strong  resilient  intelligent  values based young person who s ready to contribute in the world in a positive manner   Sherri Tombarge  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute
