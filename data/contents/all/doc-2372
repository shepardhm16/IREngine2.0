interdisciplinary skills in the field of economics this semester  thanks to a grant from the Charles Koch Foundation  Allen and Col  Atin Basu  both of the economics and business department  were awarded  5 000 grants last year  Affirming VMI s strong academic reputation  the foundation contacted the professors directly and encouraged them to apply  The grant has enabled Allen to add a one

Fast and Slow   Hopefully they are getting some new material   I think most of this will be new content for them  said Allen  who pointed out that Kahneman is a psychologist  so his viewpoint is different from what cadets usually encounter in their economics classes   It gives them a chance in a less formal way to synthesize ideas  they re talking about behavioral  economics  they might talk about accounting  they re talking about other things they ve learned along the way  The bridge between economics and psychology is indicative on a larger scale of the continuity the economics and business faculty are focusing on within their own department   One of the things our department is working on is   increasing the interconnectedness of our courses  he said  Synthesizing ideas from different courses is part of that work   The goal is to develop critical thinking  That is part of the  business and economics  department s mission  That s a reflective process that takes time  Allen explained  Cadet Zachary Wilkinson  14 echoed this sentiment   With a typical class its more about learning what and not the why  With the discussion in our independent study we are able to more intensely study the  why  aspect of the concepts we are being taught  he said   It s like the difference between being able to drive a car and being able to build the engine for it   From the perspective of the grant  the Koch Foundation is pushing scholarly engagement   after college  Allen added   The better they can think  period  the better they re going to do at that  He noted that opportunities such as this are scarce during the academic year  and  for many cadets  are scarce even in the summer since military commitments or internships may prevent them from engaging in long term projects that require summer research  Beyond the weekly meeting  cadets are formulating research proposals based on their reading and discussion  Since all are 1st Class cadets  this could be a starting point for post graduate work   When you have to write up a prospectus  it forces you to individualize what you re thinking about and form a question  said Allen  In a recent group meeting  Cadet Zachary Wilkinson recapped Kahneman s description of how the brain handles different tasks  System 1  said Wilkinson  is the gut reaction  and System 2  a problem solving approach  Allen followed up by remarking that this work has been influential in behavioral economics   If you can understand how people behave  then you can understand   ways to improve all sorts of things  Another topic the book deals with is the  priming effect  in which responses to a stimulus are affected by previous exposure to other stimuli   How people think  how they behave  is a natural bridge between the psychology of the mind and economic structures  Allen said  The group discussed evidence of the effect in the Rat Line  The cadets theorized that when they called an upperclass cadet  sir  as rats because it was required  they actually felt more respect for that cadet than they otherwise would   The language of respect that you use here makes you more likely to act respectful  Allen concluded  As the cadets recognize and appreciate the brain s systems for solving problems   especially the trade offs between what Kahneman calls System 1 and System 2   they will have a better comprehension of how economic systems function  Also  because individuals make countless decisions subconsciously or unconsciously depending on how information is presented  our students will be better equipped to

Behavioral Economics Reading Group Explores Behavioral Economics Five 1st Class cadets under the direction of Lt  Col  Sam Allen have the opportunity to practice their critical thinking and interdisciplinary skills in the field of economics this semester  thanks to a grant from the Charles Koch Foundation  Allen and Col  Atin Basu  both of the economics and business department  were awarded  5 000 grants last year  Affirming VMI s strong academic reputation  the foundation contacted the professors directly and encouraged them to apply  The grant has enabled Allen to add a one credit class to his normal teaching load  In the class  he leads a weekly reading group of economics and business majors who are discussing 2002 Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman s book  Thinking  Fast and Slow   Hopefully they are getting some new material   I think most of this will be new content for them  said Allen  who pointed out that Kahneman is a psychologist  so his viewpoint is different from what cadets usually encounter in their economics classes   It gives them a chance in a less formal way to synthesize ideas  they re talking about behavioral  economics  they might talk about accounting  they re talking about other things they ve learned along the way  The bridge between economics and psychology is indicative on a larger scale of the continuity the economics and business faculty are focusing on within their own department   One of the things our department is working on is   increasing the interconnectedness of our courses  he said  Synthesizing ideas from different courses is part of that work   The goal is to develop critical thinking  That is part of the  business and economics  department s mission  That s a reflective process that takes time  Allen explained  Cadet Zachary Wilkinson  14 echoed this sentiment   With a typical class its more about learning what and not the why  With the discussion in our independent study we are able to more intensely study the  why  aspect of the concepts we are being taught  he said   It s like the difference between being able to drive a car and being able to build the engine for it   From the perspective of the grant  the Koch Foundation is pushing scholarly engagement   after college  Allen added   The better they can think  period  the better they re going to do at that  He noted that opportunities such as this are scarce during the academic year  and  for many cadets  are scarce even in the summer since military commitments or internships may prevent them from engaging in long term projects that require summer research  Beyond the weekly meeting  cadets are formulating research proposals based on their reading and discussion  Since all are 1st Class cadets  this could be a starting point for post graduate work   When you have to write up a prospectus  it forces you to individualize what you re thinking about and form a question  said Allen  In a recent group meeting  Cadet Zachary Wilkinson recapped Kahneman s description of how the brain handles different tasks  System 1  said Wilkinson  is the gut reaction  and System 2  a problem solving approach  Allen followed up by remarking that this work has been influential in behavioral economics   If you can understand how people behave  then you can understand   ways to improve all sorts of things  Another topic the book deals with is the  priming effect  in which responses to a stimulus are affected by previous exposure to other stimuli   How people think  how they behave  is a natural bridge between the psychology of the mind and economic structures  Allen said  The group discussed evidence of the effect in the Rat Line  The cadets theorized that when they called an upperclass cadet  sir  as rats because it was required  they actually felt more respect for that cadet than they otherwise would   The language of respect that you use here makes you more likely to act respectful  Allen concluded  As the cadets recognize and appreciate the brain s systems for solving problems   especially the trade offs between what Kahneman calls System 1 and System 2   they will have a better comprehension of how economic systems function  Also  because individuals make countless decisions subconsciously or unconsciously depending on how information is presented  our students will be better equipped to understand behavior and improve the design of current and future institutions  Discussion of Kahneman s book should inspire these cadets to think in new directions as they craft their own research
