level  This report was written by Superintendent Francis H  Smith   Head Quarters  Virginia Mil  Institute  July 15  1864 Sir  The Board of Visitors assembles under peculiar circumstance today  On the Sabbath morning of June 12  the beautiful buildings erected by the liberality of the state for her favored military school  were made a mass of ruins by the order of Major General D  Hunter  commanding U  S  Army of Western Virginia  after having been first sacked by his lawless and rapacious soldiery  The quarters and offices of the Superintendent alone remain  and the order for the destruction of these was only suspended  because the illness of two of my children  one with an infant 48 hours old  did not permit them to be removed without risk of life  After I had left  it became necessary  for the security of my sick children during the shelling  to remove them from the rooms which they occupied to one affording greater protection  This removal  and another when the shelling was over  was made with the aid of my two servants  upon whom my wife was entirely dependent  While the circumstances of others justified no appeal to them for aid  the situation of my family deprived her of the opportunity of rendering assistance to anyone  At the time she was told by the wife of a neighboring officer who had heard from the commanding general that my quarters with the others were to be destroyed  my wife had not the help necessary to remove her children from the house  and was of course without the means of securing one article of her own furniture  This statement is made to set a rest the baseless rumors in circulation  that my family was required to take the oath  that the rooms they occupied were searched by officials  that the house was tendered to Gen  Hunter as his headquarters to save it from destruction  or that they were called upon  in any way  to compromise their self respect  Every species of public property was removed or wantonly destroyed  and among the most serious losses are to be named our valuable library the accumulated care of twenty five years and the philosophical apparatus  so long used by our late distinguished professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  The apparatus and many of the valuable books had been removed to Washington College  under the presumption that this venerable institution might afford a shelter and protection to them  But the work of destruction went on  The college building was sacked  the libraries of both institutions were destroyed  and every particle of philosophical apparatus broken to pieces  Shavings had been prepared to fire the college buildings also  and the design was only prevented by representations from some of the trustees  setting forth the purely civil organization of the college  and that it was the recipient of the bounty of Washington himself  Our hospital was first rifled of all of its most valuable medical stores  and was then burnt  although one severely wounded cadet and one sick cadet  dependent upon both for comfort and almost for life  had to be removed from the building at great risk  in the midst of the shelling and the rifle balls of the sharpshooters  The families of Colonels Williamson and Gilham were required by rude officials to vacate their quarters  and although they were allowed the privilege of removing their furniture  in part  through the kind interposition of the Hon  S  McD  Moore  few facilities were afforded them to do so  and the torch was applied while helpless females were endeavoring to save their little stores  and their quarters and many of their personal effects were destroyed  Every public document connected with the operations of the institute  found in my office  and there were many copies of the various annual reports  and registers  was destroyed or removed 1  My private library was rifled of many of its most valuable and portable volumes  and the portraits of Ex Governors McDowell  Wise and Letcher  which occupied prominent positions in it  were removed  The houses of our poorest operatives  including seamstresses  laundresses and laborers  were searched  in common with those of the citizens generally  and some of these persons were left in a destitute and almost starving condition  The kindness of friends in Lexington had opened their houses to receive the trunks and effects of cadets  Such houses were made the peculiar objects of vindictive spoliation    Our shoe shop was despoiled of all of its leather and unfinished work  and the shoe lasts  implements and benches were there wantonly destroyed  The bell attached to our public clock was taken down and removed  and the beautiful bronze copy of Houdon s Washington  photo at left  by the gifted and lamented Hubard  after being mutilated in the effort to take it from its pedestal  was removed  Report has come in within the last few days  that the enemy being unable to transport this work of art through the mountain passes of Virginia  it was finally broken to pieces and destroyed 2  All the regular Negro servants of the institution showed a marked fidelity  Our trusty baker  Anderson  the property of the institute  was stripped of everything  and on being asked whether he had made himself known as belonging to the state  promptly replied   No indeed if I had told the Yankees that  they would have burnt me up with the other state property  I have been particular in the recital I have given of the conduct of the enemy tot his institution  because I desire to give permanence to the record of infamy which has immortalized the U  S  Army of Western Virginia here  The Virginia Military Institute has sought no exemption from those evils which are inseparable from a state of war  In every way  directly and indirectly  in which it could be made tributary to the success of the life struggle in which our country is engaged  the contribution has been made heartily and in no stinted measure  The corps of cadets prepared for the field  at Camp Lee  15 000 men of the army of first Manassas  and every battlefield has been hallowed by the blood of its sons  Every professor and every officer had his appointed work  and each  from the world renowned Jackson  has discharged his whole duty with earnestness and fidelity  When public expediency required the reopening of the school on the 1st of January 1862  its course of instruction was specially accommodated to make it auxiliary to our struggle  Munitions of war were prepared for the army in the field  The battalion of cadets was kept on a war footing  to resist the raids of the enemy  and has effectively aided in this important duty  Upon the call of the gallant Breckinridge  they were summoned to the battlefield at New Market  and fought with a gallantry which has marked them as the objects of peculiar hatred to the enemy  They were subsequently called  upon the requisition of the secretary of war  to assist in the defense of the capital of our state and Confederacy  and remained near Richmond until the advance of the enemy up the Valley of Virginia under Hunter  again threatened the Virginia Military Institute  They were promptly moved to the support of McCausland  but were unable  from the overpowering weight of numbers  to offer effectual resistance where they most desired to do so  under the walls of the institution itself  It was a painful sacrifice which required them to surrender the home of their cadet life without a struggle  But they were soon reunited to their victorious leader at Lynchburg  and there had the satisfaction of witnessing the discomfiture of the army of Hunter  and once more the standard of Virginia floats from the institute hill  So that in every possible way in which a military school could be made available to our patriotic cause  it has been fully and freely done  No one  therefore  belonging to the institution can complain that the rules of war should be applied to an establishment marked by such evidences of identification with our revolutionary struggle  It was to have been expected that the cadets should be pursued  that they might be either killed or captured  They asked no immunities from the rigors of war meted to to others  The arms and munitions of war were proper subjects for capture or destruction  Its public buildings might have been held by the enemy as a barracks or hospital  and the school itself dispersed  But modern history is appealed to in vain for a like instance of devastation  as marked the track of the invader here  General Hunter commanded an organized army of the United States  whose professed mission was the  restoration of the Union    and yet it was by his order  and against the remonstrances  as I understand  of some of his own general officers  that the public buildings of the Virginia Military Institute were committed to the flames  and the threat was made by him that the university of Virginia should soon share a like fate  he is not only responsible for an act deliberately executed  but for the effort clearly manifested to consign to utter destruction every record that could mark the character or history of being of the Virginia Military Institute  Not satisfied with desolation  its walls were polluted with the most obscene language in association with the names of men from Ohio  Pennsylvania  New York  and Massachusetts   On page 34 of the original report  Smith describes the location and role of the cadets during the first two weeks of June  In early June  in camp in Staunton  Va  following their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15    Having joined the corps in Staunton  I there received the orders of the adjutant general directing me to move the cadets to Richmond  to aid in the defense of the capital  Having reported to the governor and secretary of war  in obedience to orders  the cadets were assigned to the command of Maj  Gen  Ransom  and were encamped about two miles from the city limits  On the 5th June intelligence reached Richmond of the defeat of Gen  W E  Jones  near Staunton  and of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Valley towards Lexington  On the 6th orders were given to me to proceed to the Virginia Military Institute  if practicable  and take such measures  in cooperation with the confederate forces  or otherwise  as might be best for the defense of the public property at the Institute  The cadets were moved on the 7th  by the Danville rail road  to Lynchburg  reaching Lynchburg at 11 P M  Learning there that the enemy were advancing upon Lexington  and that Brig  Gen  McCausland was resisting their advance  I moved the cadets immediately  by freight boats  up the canal and they reached Lexington at 3 P M  on the 9th    On the 10th a dispatch was received by me from Gen  McCausland   image at left  that he had been strongly pressed by the enemy all day  and was then fighting with them on the Brownsburg road  near Brownsburg  By sundown he had been driven to Cameron s farm  two miles from Lexington  I had an interview with Gen  McCausland that night  I told him that if by a determined resistance he could  with the cooperation of the cadets  save Lexington  and with it the public property at the Virginia Military Institute  I was prepared to give him that cooperation at any sacrifice  But if a contest here could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  and result in the killing or capturing of the cadets  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think  with the strong force opposing him  that he could save the town  but under his advice  I determined to remain with the cadets on their ground  and hold them in readiness to cooperate with him  could this be done effectively  On the morning of the 11th the enemy advanced about 8 oclock  and three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills north of the town  McCausland having burned the bridge over the North river  planted a section of artillery on the magazine hill  and occupied the adjoining cliffs with sharpshooters  An active artillery and musketry fire from sharpshooters soon opened  and continued for several hours  The cadets were not engaged  and after waiting until 1 P M  and apprehending that the flanks of McCausland would be turned either by Hamilton s cross or Leyburn s fords  I gave orders to Lieut  Col  Ship to move the corps of cadets  by the fair ground road  and cross the North River by the bridge at its mouth  McCausland retired from Lexington about 3  and in about one hour after the enemy entered  The cadets remained near Balcony Falls from Saturday evening until Wednesday  and rendered good service in guarding the property of refugees  collected from the various counties of the Valley in that vicinity  Apprehending danger from the advance of the enemy into Bedford in pursuit of McCausland  and from a raid into Amherst  I ordered Col  Ship on the 15th to move the cadets by freight boats to Lynchburg  A courier from Gen  Breckinridge at Lynchburg met me on the way  and brought me instructions to move immediately to Lynchburg  and take the north side of the river  As the command had already passed Waugh s ferry  the danger apprehended by General Breckinridge no longer existed  and the cadets reached Lynchburg safely the next morning at 8 o clock  and I immediately reported to Gen  Breckinridge  and also to the governor and board of visitors  The cadets remained in camp near Lynchburg until after the repulse of Hunter  and on the 24th June  under instructions received from the board of visitors  the cadets were ordered back to Lexington  and reached there on the 25th  Having failed to procure the tents which had been ordered upon the requisition of the adjutant general  the cadets occupied temporarily the buildings of Washington college  which had been kindly placed at their disposal  Finding  upon examination  that most of our commissary stores had been destroyed or taken by the enemy that the public property was in a state of utter ruin I deemed it my duty to place all the cadets who were able to reach their homes  or the homes of their friends  on furlough until the 1st of September  and to make provision to take care of the remainder as well as my means would enable me  Under these orders  all the cadets  except some three or four  are now on furlough  In the mean time I have employed all the operatives of the institution in gathering up the valuable material found in the ruins  placing the same in a place of security  I have also rented a store in Lexington for the deposit of quartermaster and commissary stores and have been endeavoring to collect such property as may have passed into the hand of parties not entitled to claim or to hold it  The board will be enabled to see  in the course of their sitting  what has been done in these respects  and will be the better qualified  by personal inspection  to give me instructions in regard thereto  1 Despite the dire tone of this sentence  almost all of VMI s records survived the Civil War  The Institute s archives are very complete  and there are no significant gaps  2 The rumor concerning the destruction of the statue was false  It was successfully transported to Wheeling  West Virginia  where it was placed on display  At the end of the war  it was returned to VMI and was  reinaugurated  on September 10  1866  The photo on this page was taken in 1866  around the time of the

Superintendent Francis H  Smith   Head Quarters  Virginia Mil  Institute  July 15  1864 Sir  The Board of Visitors assembles under peculiar circumstance today  On the Sabbath morning of June 12  the beautiful buildings erected by the liberality of the state for her favored military school  were made a mass of ruins by the order of Major General D  Hunter  commanding U  S  Army of Western Virginia  after having been first sacked by his lawless and rapacious soldiery  The quarters and offices of the Superintendent alone remain  and the order for the destruction of these was only suspended  because the illness of two of my children  one with an infant 48 hours old  did not permit them to be removed without risk of life  After I had left  it became necessary  for the security of my sick children during the shelling  to remove them from the rooms which they occupied to one affording greater protection  This removal  and another when the shelling was over  was made with the aid of my two servants  upon whom my wife was entirely dependent  While the circumstances of others justified no appeal to them for aid  the situation of my family deprived her of the opportunity of rendering assistance to anyone  At the time she was told by the wife of a neighboring officer who had heard from the commanding general that my quarters with the others were to be destroyed  my wife had not the help necessary to remove her children from the house  and was of course without the means of securing one article of her own furniture  This statement is made to set a rest the baseless rumors in circulation  that my family was required to take the oath  that the rooms they occupied were searched by officials  that the house was tendered to Gen  Hunter as his headquarters to save it from destruction  or that they were called upon  in any way  to compromise their self respect  Every species of public property was removed or wantonly destroyed  and among the most serious losses are to be named our valuable library the accumulated care of twenty five years and the philosophical apparatus  so long used by our late distinguished professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  The apparatus and many of the valuable books had been removed to Washington College  under the presumption that this venerable institution might afford a shelter and protection to them  But the work of destruction went on  The college building was sacked  the libraries of both institutions were destroyed  and every particle of philosophical apparatus broken to pieces  Shavings had been prepared to fire the college buildings also  and the design was only prevented by representations from some of the trustees  setting forth the purely civil organization of the college  and that it was the recipient of the bounty of Washington himself  Our hospital was first rifled of all of its most valuable medical stores  and was then burnt  although one severely wounded cadet and one sick cadet  dependent upon both for comfort and almost for life  had to be removed from the building at great risk  in the midst of the shelling and the rifle balls of the sharpshooters  The families of Colonels Williamson and Gilham were required by rude officials to vacate their quarters  and although they were allowed the privilege of removing their furniture  in part  through the kind interposition of the Hon  S  McD  Moore  few facilities were afforded them to do so  and the torch was applied while helpless females were endeavoring to save their little stores  and their quarters and many of their personal effects were destroyed  Every public document connected with the operations of the institute  found in my office  and there were many copies of the various annual reports  and registers  was destroyed or removed 1  My private library was rifled of many of its most valuable and portable volumes  and the portraits of Ex Governors McDowell  Wise and Letcher  which occupied prominent positions in it  were removed  The houses of our poorest operatives  including seamstresses  laundresses and laborers  were searched  in common with those of the citizens generally  and some of these persons were left in a destitute and almost starving condition  The kindness of friends in Lexington had opened their houses to receive the trunks and effects of cadets  Such houses were made the peculiar objects of vindictive spoliation    Our shoe shop was despoiled of all of its leather and unfinished work  and the shoe lasts  implements and benches were there wantonly destroyed  The bell attached to our public clock was taken down and removed  and the beautiful bronze copy of Houdon s Washington  photo at left  by the gifted and lamented Hubard  after being mutilated in the effort to take it from its pedestal  was removed  Report has come in within the last few days  that the enemy being unable to transport this work of art through the mountain passes of Virginia  it was finally broken to pieces and destroyed 2  All the regular Negro servants of the institution showed a marked fidelity  Our trusty baker  Anderson  the property of the institute  was stripped of everything  and on being asked whether he had made himself known as belonging to the state  promptly replied   No indeed if I had told the Yankees that  they would have burnt me up with the other state property  I have been particular in the recital I have given of the conduct of the enemy tot his institution  because I desire to give permanence to the record of infamy which has immortalized the U  S  Army of Western Virginia here  The Virginia Military Institute has sought no exemption from those evils which are inseparable from a state of war  In every way  directly and indirectly  in which it could be made tributary to the success of the life struggle in which our country is engaged  the contribution has been made heartily and in no stinted measure  The corps of cadets prepared for the field  at Camp Lee  15 000 men of the army of first Manassas  and every battlefield has been hallowed by the blood of its sons  Every professor and every officer had his appointed work  and each  from the world renowned Jackson  has discharged his whole duty with earnestness and fidelity  When public expediency required the reopening of the school on the 1st of January 1862  its course of instruction was specially accommodated to make it auxiliary to our struggle  Munitions of war were prepared for the army in the field  The battalion of cadets was kept on a war footing  to resist the raids of the enemy  and has effectively aided in this important duty  Upon the call of the gallant Breckinridge  they were summoned to the battlefield at New Market  and fought with a gallantry which has marked them as the objects of peculiar hatred to the enemy  They were subsequently called  upon the requisition of the secretary of war  to assist in the defense of the capital of our state and Confederacy  and remained near Richmond until the advance of the enemy up the Valley of Virginia under Hunter  again threatened the Virginia Military Institute  They were promptly moved to the support of McCausland  but were unable  from the overpowering weight of numbers  to offer effectual resistance where they most desired to do so  under the walls of the institution itself  It was a painful sacrifice which required them to surrender the home of their cadet life without a struggle  But they were soon reunited to their victorious leader at Lynchburg  and there had the satisfaction of witnessing the discomfiture of the army of Hunter  and once more the standard of Virginia floats from the institute hill  So that in every possible way in which a military school could be made available to our patriotic cause  it has been fully and freely done  No one  therefore  belonging to the institution can complain that the rules of war should be applied to an establishment marked by such evidences of identification with our revolutionary struggle  It was to have been expected that the cadets should be pursued  that they might be either killed or captured  They asked no immunities from the rigors of war meted to to others  The arms and munitions of war were proper subjects for capture or destruction  Its public buildings might have been held by the enemy as a barracks or hospital  and the school itself dispersed  But modern history is appealed to in vain for a like instance of devastation  as marked the track of the invader here  General Hunter commanded an organized army of the United States  whose professed mission was the  restoration of the Union    and yet it was by his order  and against the remonstrances  as I understand  of some of his own general officers  that the public buildings of the Virginia Military Institute were committed to the flames  and the threat was made by him that the university of Virginia should soon share a like fate  he is not only responsible for an act deliberately executed  but for the effort clearly manifested to consign to utter destruction every record that could mark the character or history of being of the Virginia Military Institute  Not satisfied with desolation  its walls were polluted with the most obscene language in association with the names of men from Ohio  Pennsylvania  New York  and Massachusetts   On page 34 of the original report  Smith describes the location and role of the cadets during the first two weeks of June  In early June  in camp in Staunton  Va  following their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15    Having joined the corps in Staunton  I there received the orders of the adjutant general directing me to move the cadets to Richmond  to aid in the defense of the capital  Having reported to the governor and secretary of war  in obedience to orders  the cadets were assigned to the command of Maj  Gen  Ransom  and were encamped about two miles from the city limits  On the 5th June intelligence reached Richmond of the defeat of Gen  W E  Jones  near Staunton  and of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Valley towards Lexington  On the 6th orders were given to me to proceed to the Virginia Military Institute  if practicable  and take such measures  in cooperation with the confederate forces  or otherwise  as might be best for the defense of the public property at the Institute  The cadets were moved on the 7th  by the Danville rail road  to Lynchburg  reaching Lynchburg at 11 P M  Learning there that the enemy were advancing upon Lexington  and that Brig  Gen  McCausland was resisting their advance  I moved the cadets immediately  by freight boats  up the canal and they reached Lexington at 3 P M  on the 9th    On the 10th a dispatch was received by me from Gen  McCausland   image at left  that he had been strongly pressed by the enemy all day  and was then fighting with them on the Brownsburg road  near Brownsburg  By sundown he had been driven to Cameron s farm  two miles from Lexington  I had an interview with Gen  McCausland that night  I told him that if by a determined resistance he could  with the cooperation of the cadets  save Lexington  and with it the public property at the Virginia Military Institute  I was prepared to give him that cooperation at any sacrifice  But if a contest here could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  and result in the killing or capturing of the cadets  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think  with the strong force opposing him  that he could save the town  but under his advice  I determined to remain with the cadets on their ground  and hold them in readiness to cooperate with him  could this be done effectively  On the morning of the 11th the enemy advanced about 8 oclock  and three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills north of the town  McCausland having burned the bridge over the North river  planted a section of artillery on the magazine hill  and occupied the adjoining cliffs with sharpshooters  An active artillery and musketry fire from sharpshooters soon opened  and continued for several hours  The cadets were not engaged  and after waiting until 1 P M  and apprehending that the flanks of McCausland would be turned either by Hamilton s cross or Leyburn s fords  I gave orders to Lieut  Col  Ship to move the corps of cadets  by the fair ground road  and cross the North River by the bridge at its mouth  McCausland retired from Lexington about 3  and in about one hour after the enemy entered  The cadets remained near Balcony Falls from Saturday evening until Wednesday  and rendered good service in guarding the property of refugees  collected from the various counties of the Valley in that vicinity  Apprehending danger from the advance of the enemy into Bedford in pursuit of McCausland  and from a raid into Amherst  I ordered Col  Ship on the 15th to move the cadets by freight boats to Lynchburg  A courier from Gen  Breckinridge at Lynchburg met me on the way  and brought me instructions to move immediately to Lynchburg  and take the north side of the river  As the command had already passed Waugh s ferry  the danger apprehended by General Breckinridge no longer existed  and the cadets reached Lynchburg safely the next morning at 8 o clock  and I immediately reported to Gen  Breckinridge  and also to the governor and board of visitors  The cadets remained in camp near Lynchburg until after the repulse of Hunter  and on the 24th June  under instructions received from the board of visitors  the cadets were ordered back to Lexington  and reached there on the 25th  Having failed to procure the tents which had been ordered upon the requisition of the adjutant general  the cadets occupied temporarily the buildings of Washington college  which had been kindly placed at their disposal  Finding  upon examination  that most of our commissary stores had been destroyed or taken by the enemy that the public property was in a state of utter ruin I deemed it my duty to place all the cadets who were able to reach their homes  or the homes of their friends  on furlough until the 1st of September  and to make provision to take care of the remainder as well as my means would enable me  Under these orders  all the cadets  except some three or four  are now on furlough  In the mean time I have employed all the operatives of the institution in gathering up the valuable material found in the ruins  placing the same in a place of security  I have also rented a store in Lexington for the deposit of quartermaster and commissary stores and have been endeavoring to collect such property as may have passed into the hand of parties not entitled to claim or to hold it  The board will be enabled to see  in the course of their sitting  what has been done in these respects  and will be the better qualified  by personal inspection  to give me instructions in regard thereto  1 Despite the dire tone of this sentence  almost all of VMI s records survived the Civil War  The Institute s archives are very complete  and there are no significant gaps  2 The rumor concerning the destruction of the statue was false  It was successfully transported to Wheeling  West Virginia  where it was placed on

furniture  This statement is made to set a rest the baseless rumors in circulation  that my family was required to take the oath  that the rooms they occupied were searched by officials  that the house was tendered to Gen  Hunter as his headquarters to save it from destruction  or that they were called upon  in any way  to compromise their self respect  Every species of public property was removed or wantonly destroyed  and among the most serious losses are to be named our valuable library the accumulated care of twenty five years and the philosophical apparatus  so long used by our late distinguished professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  The apparatus and many of the valuable books had been removed to Washington College  under the presumption that this venerable institution might afford a shelter and protection to them  But the work of destruction went on  The college building was sacked  the libraries of both institutions were destroyed  and every particle of philosophical apparatus broken to pieces  Shavings had been prepared to fire the college buildings also  and the design was only prevented by representations from some of the trustees  setting forth the purely civil organization of the college  and that it was the recipient of the bounty of Washington himself  Our hospital was first rifled of all of its most valuable medical stores  and was then burnt  although one severely wounded cadet and one sick cadet  dependent upon both for comfort and almost for life  had to be removed from the building at great risk  in the midst of the shelling and the rifle balls of the sharpshooters  The families of Colonels Williamson and Gilham were required by rude officials to vacate their quarters  and although they were allowed the privilege of removing their furniture  in part  through the kind interposition of the Hon  S  McD  Moore  few facilities were afforded them to do so  and the torch was applied while helpless females were endeavoring to save their little stores  and their quarters and many of their personal effects were destroyed  Every public document connected with the operations of the institute  found in my office  and there were many copies of the various annual reports  and registers  was destroyed or removed 1  My private library was rifled of many of its most valuable and portable volumes  and the portraits of Ex Governors McDowell  Wise and Letcher  which occupied prominent positions in it  were removed  The houses of our poorest operatives  including seamstresses  laundresses and laborers  were searched  in common with those of the citizens generally  and some of these persons were left in a destitute and almost starving condition  The kindness of friends in Lexington had opened their houses to receive the trunks and effects of cadets  Such houses were made the peculiar objects of vindictive spoliation    Our shoe shop was despoiled of all of its leather and unfinished work  and the shoe lasts  implements and benches were there wantonly destroyed  The bell attached to our public clock was taken down and removed  and the beautiful bronze copy of Houdon s Washington  photo at left  by the gifted and lamented Hubard  after being mutilated in the effort to take it from its pedestal  was removed  Report has come in within the last few days  that the enemy being unable to transport this work of art through the mountain passes of Virginia  it was finally broken to pieces and destroyed 2  All the regular Negro servants of the institution showed a marked fidelity  Our trusty baker  Anderson  the property of the institute  was stripped of everything  and on being asked whether he had made himself known as belonging to the state  promptly replied   No indeed if I had told the Yankees that  they would have burnt me up with the other state property  I have been particular in the recital I have given of the conduct of the enemy tot his institution  because I desire to give permanence to the record of infamy which has immortalized the U  S  Army of Western Virginia here  The Virginia Military Institute has sought no exemption from those evils which are inseparable from a state of war  In every way  directly and indirectly  in which it could be made tributary to the success of the life struggle in which our country is engaged  the contribution has been made heartily and in no stinted measure  The corps of cadets prepared for the field  at Camp Lee  15 000 men of the army of first Manassas  and every battlefield has been hallowed by the blood of its sons  Every professor and every officer had his appointed work  and each  from the world renowned Jackson  has discharged his whole duty with earnestness and fidelity  When public expediency required the reopening of the school on the 1st of January 1862  its course of instruction was specially accommodated to make it auxiliary to our struggle  Munitions of war were prepared for the army in the field  The battalion of cadets was kept on a war footing  to resist the raids of the enemy  and has effectively aided in this important duty  Upon the call of the gallant Breckinridge  they were summoned to the battlefield at New Market  and fought with a gallantry which has marked them as the objects of peculiar hatred to the enemy  They were subsequently called  upon the requisition of the secretary of war  to assist in the defense of the capital of our state and Confederacy  and remained near Richmond until the advance of the enemy up the Valley of Virginia under Hunter  again threatened the Virginia Military Institute  They were promptly moved to the support of McCausland  but were unable  from the overpowering weight of numbers  to offer effectual resistance where they most desired to do so  under the walls of the institution itself  It was a painful sacrifice which required them to surrender the home of their cadet life without a struggle  But they were soon reunited to their victorious leader at Lynchburg  and there had the satisfaction of witnessing the discomfiture of the army of Hunter  and once more the standard of Virginia floats from the institute hill  So that in every possible way in which a military school could be made available to our patriotic cause  it has been fully and freely done  No one  therefore  belonging to the institution can complain that the rules of war should be applied to an establishment marked by such evidences of identification with our revolutionary struggle  It was to have been expected that the cadets should be pursued  that they might be either killed or captured  They asked no immunities from the rigors of war meted to to others  The arms and munitions of war were proper subjects for capture or destruction  Its public buildings might have been held by the enemy as a barracks or hospital  and the school itself dispersed  But modern history is appealed to in vain for a like instance of devastation  as marked the track of the invader here  General Hunter commanded an organized army of the United States  whose professed mission was the  restoration of the Union    and yet it was by his order  and against the remonstrances  as I understand  of some of his own general officers  that the public buildings of the Virginia Military Institute were committed to the flames  and the threat was made by him that the university of Virginia should soon share a like fate  he is not only responsible for an act deliberately executed  but for the effort clearly manifested to consign to utter destruction every record that could mark the character or history of being of the Virginia Military Institute  Not satisfied with desolation  its walls were polluted with the most obscene language in association with the names of men from Ohio  Pennsylvania  New York  and Massachusetts   On page 34 of the original report  Smith describes the location and role of the cadets during the first two weeks of June  In early June  in camp in Staunton  Va  following their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15    Having joined the corps in Staunton  I there received the orders of the adjutant general directing me to move the cadets to Richmond  to aid in the defense of the capital  Having reported to the governor and secretary of war  in obedience to orders  the cadets were assigned to the command of Maj  Gen  Ransom  and were encamped about two miles from the city limits  On the 5th June intelligence reached Richmond of the defeat of Gen  W E  Jones  near Staunton  and of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Valley towards Lexington  On the 6th orders were given to me to proceed to the Virginia Military Institute  if practicable  and take such measures  in cooperation with the confederate forces  or otherwise  as might be best for the defense of the public property at the Institute  The cadets were moved on the 7th  by the Danville rail road  to Lynchburg  reaching Lynchburg at 11 P M  Learning there that the enemy were advancing upon Lexington  and that Brig  Gen  McCausland was resisting their advance  I moved the cadets immediately  by freight boats  up the canal and they reached Lexington at 3 P M  on the 9th    On the 10th a dispatch was received by me from Gen  McCausland   image at left  that he had been strongly pressed by the enemy all day  and was then fighting with them on the Brownsburg road  near Brownsburg  By sundown he had been driven to Cameron s farm  two miles from Lexington  I had an interview with Gen  McCausland that night  I told him that if by a determined resistance he could  with the cooperation of the cadets  save Lexington  and with it the public property at the Virginia Military Institute  I was prepared to give him that cooperation at any sacrifice  But if a contest here could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  and result in the killing or capturing of the cadets  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think  with the strong force opposing him  that he could save the town  but under his advice  I determined to remain with the cadets on their ground  and hold them in readiness to cooperate with him  could this be done effectively  On the morning of the 11th the enemy advanced about 8 oclock  and three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills north of the town  McCausland having burned the bridge over the North river  planted a section of artillery on the magazine hill  and occupied the adjoining cliffs with sharpshooters  An active artillery and musketry fire from sharpshooters soon opened  and continued for several hours  The cadets were not engaged  and after waiting until 1 P M  and apprehending that the flanks of McCausland would be turned either by Hamilton s cross or Leyburn s fords  I gave orders to Lieut  Col  Ship to move the corps of cadets  by the fair ground road  and cross the North River by the bridge at its mouth  McCausland retired from Lexington about 3  and in about one hour after the enemy entered  The cadets remained near Balcony Falls from Saturday evening until Wednesday  and rendered good service in guarding the property of refugees  collected from the various counties of the Valley in that vicinity  Apprehending danger from the advance of the enemy into Bedford in pursuit of McCausland  and from a raid into Amherst  I ordered Col  Ship on the 15th to move the cadets by freight boats to Lynchburg  A courier from Gen  Breckinridge at Lynchburg met me on the way  and brought me instructions to move immediately to Lynchburg  and take the north side of the river  As the command had already passed Waugh s ferry  the danger apprehended by General Breckinridge no longer existed  and the cadets reached Lynchburg safely the next morning at 8 o clock  and I immediately reported to Gen  Breckinridge  and also to the governor and board of visitors  The cadets remained in camp near Lynchburg until after the repulse of Hunter  and on the 24th June  under instructions received from the board of visitors  the cadets were ordered back to Lexington  and reached there on the 25th  Having failed to procure the tents which had been ordered upon the requisition of the adjutant general  the cadets occupied temporarily the buildings of Washington college  which had been kindly placed at their disposal  Finding  upon examination  that most of our commissary stores had been destroyed or taken by the enemy that the public property was in a state of utter ruin I deemed it my duty to place all the cadets who were able to reach their homes  or the homes of their friends  on furlough until the 1st of September  and to make provision to take care of the remainder as well as my means would enable me  Under these orders  all the cadets  except some three or four  are now on furlough  In the mean time I have employed all the operatives of the institution in gathering up the valuable material found in the ruins  placing the same in a place of security  I have also rented a store in Lexington for the deposit of quartermaster and commissary stores and have been endeavoring to collect such property as may have passed into the hand of parties not entitled to claim or to hold it  The board will be enabled to see  in the course of their sitting  what has been done in these respects  and will be the better qualified  by personal inspection  to give me instructions in regard thereto  1 Despite the dire tone of this sentence  almost all of VMI s records survived the Civil War  The Institute s archives are very complete  and there are no significant gaps  2 The rumor concerning the destruction of the statue was false  It was successfully transported to Wheeling  West Virginia  where it was placed on display  At the end of the war  it was returned to VMI and was  reinaugurated  on September 10  1866  The photo on this page was taken in 1866  around the time of the statue s rededication ceremony  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets

Raid The Burning of VMI  June 1864 From the VMI Annual Report Hunter s Raid top level  This report was written by Superintendent Francis H  Smith   Head Quarters  Virginia Mil  Institute  July 15  1864 Sir  The Board of Visitors assembles under peculiar circumstance today  On the Sabbath morning of June 12  the beautiful buildings erected by the liberality of the state for her favored military school  were made a mass of ruins by the order of Major General D  Hunter  commanding U  S  Army of Western Virginia  after having been first sacked by his lawless and rapacious soldiery  The quarters and offices of the Superintendent alone remain  and the order for the destruction of these was only suspended  because the illness of two of my children  one with an infant 48 hours old  did not permit them to be removed without risk of life  After I had left  it became necessary  for the security of my sick children during the shelling  to remove them from the rooms which they occupied to one affording greater protection  This removal  and another when the shelling was over  was made with the aid of my two servants  upon whom my wife was entirely dependent  While the circumstances of others justified no appeal to them for aid  the situation of my family deprived her of the opportunity of rendering assistance to anyone  At the time she was told by the wife of a neighboring officer who had heard from the commanding general that my quarters with the others were to be destroyed  my wife had not the help necessary to remove her children from the house  and was of course without the means of securing one article of her own furniture  This statement is made to set a rest the baseless rumors in circulation  that my family was required to take the oath  that the rooms they occupied were searched by officials  that the house was tendered to Gen  Hunter as his headquarters to save it from destruction  or that they were called upon  in any way  to compromise their self respect  Every species of public property was removed or wantonly destroyed  and among the most serious losses are to be named our valuable library the accumulated care of twenty five years and the philosophical apparatus  so long used by our late distinguished professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  The apparatus and many of the valuable books had been removed to Washington College  under the presumption that this venerable institution might afford a shelter and protection to them  But the work of destruction went on  The college building was sacked  the libraries of both institutions were destroyed  and every particle of philosophical apparatus broken to pieces  Shavings had been prepared to fire the college buildings also  and the design

to do so  and the torch was applied while helpless females were endeavoring to save their little stores  and their quarters and many of their personal effects were destroyed  Every public document connected with the operations of the institute  found in my office  and there were many copies of the various annual reports  and registers  was destroyed or removed 1  My private library was rifled of many of its most valuable and portable volumes  and the portraits of Ex Governors McDowell  Wise and Letcher  which occupied prominent positions in it  were removed  The houses of our poorest operatives  including seamstresses  laundresses and laborers  were searched  in common with those of the citizens generally  and some of these persons were left in a destitute and almost starving condition  The kindness of friends in Lexington had opened their houses to receive the trunks and effects of cadets  Such houses were made the peculiar objects of vindictive spoliation    Our shoe shop was despoiled of all of its leather and unfinished work  and the shoe lasts  implements and benches were there wantonly destroyed  The bell attached to our public clock was taken down and removed  and the beautiful bronze copy of Houdon s Washington  photo at left  by the gifted and lamented Hubard  after being mutilated in the effort to take it from its pedestal  was removed  Report has come in within the last few days  that the enemy being unable to transport this work of art through the mountain passes of Virginia  it was finally broken to pieces and destroyed 2  All the regular Negro

A courier from Gen  Breckinridge at Lynchburg met me on the way  and brought me instructions to move immediately to Lynchburg  and take the north side of the river  As the command had already passed Waugh s ferry  the danger apprehended by General Breckinridge no longer existed  and the cadets reached Lynchburg safely the next morning at 8 o clock  and I immediately reported to Gen  Breckinridge  and also to the governor and board of visitors  The cadets remained in camp near Lynchburg until after the repulse of Hunter  and on the 24th June  under instructions received from the board of visitors  the cadets were ordered back to Lexington  and reached there on the 25th  Having failed to procure the tents which had been ordered upon the requisition of the adjutant general  the cadets occupied temporarily the buildings of Washington college  which had been kindly placed at their disposal  Finding  upon examination  that most of our commissary stores had been destroyed or taken by the enemy that the public property was in a state of utter ruin I deemed it my duty to place all the cadets who were able to reach their homes  or the homes of their friends  on furlough until the 1st of September  and to make provision to take care of the remainder as well as my means would enable me  Under these orders  all the cadets  except some three or four  are now on furlough  In the mean time I have employed all the operatives of the institution in gathering up the valuable material found in the ruins  placing the same in a place of security  I have also rented a store in Lexington for the deposit of quartermaster and commissary stores and have been endeavoring to collect such property as may have passed into the hand of parties not entitled to claim or to hold it  The board will be enabled to see  in the course of their sitting  what has been done in these respects  and will be the better qualified  by personal inspection  to give me instructions in regard thereto  1

was written by Superintendent Francis H  Smith   Head Quarters  Virginia Mil  Institute  July 15  1864 Sir  The Board of Visitors assembles under peculiar circumstance today  On the Sabbath morning of June 12  the beautiful buildings erected by the liberality of the state for her favored military school  were made a mass of ruins by the order of Major General D  Hunter  commanding U  S  Army of Western Virginia  after having been first sacked by his lawless and rapacious soldiery  The quarters and offices of the Superintendent alone remain  and the order for the destruction of these was only suspended  because the illness of two of my children  one with an infant 48 hours old  did not permit them to be removed without risk of life  After I had left  it became necessary  for the security of my sick children during the shelling  to remove them from the rooms which they occupied to one affording greater protection  This removal  and another when the shelling was over  was made with the aid of my two servants  upon whom my wife was entirely dependent  While the circumstances of others justified no appeal to them for aid  the situation of my family deprived her of the opportunity of rendering assistance to anyone  At the time she was told by the wife of a neighboring officer who had heard from the commanding general that my quarters with the others were to be destroyed  my wife had not the help necessary to remove her children from the house  and was of course without the means of securing one article of her own furniture  This statement is made to set a rest the baseless rumors in circulation  that my family was required to take the oath  that the rooms they occupied were searched by officials  that the house was tendered to Gen  Hunter as his headquarters to save it from destruction  or that they were called upon  in any way  to compromise their self respect  Every species of public property was removed or wantonly destroyed  and among the most serious losses are to be named our valuable library the accumulated care of twenty five years and the philosophical apparatus  so long used by our late distinguished professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  The apparatus and many of the valuable books had been removed to Washington College  under the presumption that this venerable institution might afford a shelter and protection to them  But the work of destruction went on  The college building was sacked  the libraries of both institutions were destroyed  and every particle of philosophical apparatus broken to pieces  Shavings had been prepared to fire the college buildings also  and the design was only prevented by representations from some of the trustees  setting forth the purely civil organization of the college  and that it was the recipient of the bounty of Washington himself  Our hospital was first rifled of all of its most valuable medical stores  and was then burnt  although one severely wounded cadet and one sick cadet  dependent upon both for comfort and almost for life  had to be removed from the building at great risk  in the midst of the shelling and the rifle balls of the sharpshooters  The families of Colonels Williamson and Gilham were required by rude officials to vacate their quarters  and although they were allowed the privilege of removing their furniture  in part  through the kind interposition of the Hon  S  McD  Moore  few facilities were afforded them to do so  and the torch was applied while helpless females were endeavoring to save their little stores  and their quarters and many of their personal effects were destroyed  Every public document connected with the operations of the institute  found in my office  and there were many copies of the various annual reports  and registers  was destroyed or removed 1  My private library was rifled of many of its most valuable and portable volumes  and the portraits of Ex Governors McDowell  Wise and Letcher  which occupied prominent positions in it  were removed  The houses of our poorest operatives  including seamstresses  laundresses and laborers  were searched  in common with those of the citizens generally  and some of these persons were left in a destitute and almost starving condition  The kindness of friends in Lexington had opened their houses to receive the trunks and effects of cadets  Such houses were made the peculiar objects of vindictive spoliation    Our shoe shop was despoiled of all of its leather and unfinished work  and the shoe lasts  implements and benches were there wantonly destroyed  The bell attached to our public clock was taken down and removed  and the beautiful bronze copy of Houdon s Washington  photo at left  by the gifted and lamented Hubard  after being mutilated in the effort to take it from its pedestal  was removed  Report has come in within the last few days  that the enemy being unable to transport this work of art through the mountain passes of Virginia  it was finally broken to pieces and destroyed 2  All the regular Negro servants of the institution showed a marked fidelity  Our trusty baker  Anderson  the property of the institute  was stripped of everything  and on being asked whether he had made himself known as belonging to the state  promptly replied   No indeed if I had told the Yankees that  they would have burnt me up with the other state property  I have been particular in the recital I have given of the conduct of the enemy tot his institution  because I desire to give permanence to the record of infamy which has immortalized the U  S  Army of Western Virginia here  The Virginia Military Institute has sought no exemption from those evils which are inseparable from a state of war  In every way  directly and indirectly  in which it could be made tributary to the success of the life struggle in which our country is engaged  the contribution has been made heartily and in no stinted measure  The corps of cadets prepared for the field  at Camp Lee  15 000 men of the army of first Manassas  and every battlefield has been hallowed by the blood of its sons  Every professor and every officer had his appointed work  and each  from the world renowned Jackson  has discharged his whole duty with earnestness and fidelity  When public expediency required the reopening of the school on the 1st of January 1862  its course of instruction was specially accommodated to make it auxiliary to our struggle  Munitions of war were prepared for the army in the field  The battalion of cadets was kept on a war footing  to resist the raids of the enemy  and has effectively aided in this important duty  Upon the call of the gallant Breckinridge  they were summoned to the battlefield at New Market  and fought with a gallantry which has marked them as the objects of peculiar hatred to the enemy  They were subsequently called  upon the requisition of the secretary of war  to assist in the defense of the capital of our state and Confederacy  and remained near Richmond until the advance of the enemy up the Valley of Virginia under Hunter  again threatened the Virginia Military Institute  They were promptly moved to the support of McCausland  but were unable  from the overpowering weight of numbers  to offer effectual resistance where they most desired to do so  under the walls of the institution itself  It was a painful sacrifice which required them to surrender the home of their cadet life without a struggle  But they were soon reunited to their victorious leader at Lynchburg  and there had the satisfaction of witnessing the discomfiture of the army of Hunter  and once more the standard of Virginia floats from the institute hill  So that in every possible way in which a military school could be made available to our patriotic cause  it has been fully and freely done  No one  therefore  belonging to the institution can complain that the rules of war should be applied to an establishment marked by such evidences of identification with our revolutionary struggle  It was to have been expected that the cadets should be pursued  that they might be either killed or captured  They asked no immunities from the rigors of war meted to to others  The arms and munitions of war were proper subjects for capture or destruction  Its public buildings might have been held by the enemy as a barracks or hospital  and the school itself dispersed  But modern history is appealed to in vain for a like instance of devastation  as marked the track of the invader here  General Hunter commanded an organized army of the United States  whose professed mission was the  restoration of the Union    and yet it was by his order  and against the remonstrances  as I understand  of some of his own general officers  that the public buildings of the Virginia Military Institute were committed to the flames  and the threat was made by him that the university of Virginia should soon share a like fate  he is not only responsible for an act deliberately executed  but for the effort clearly manifested to consign to utter destruction every record that could mark the character or history of being of the Virginia Military Institute  Not satisfied with desolation  its walls were polluted with the most obscene language in association with the names of men from Ohio  Pennsylvania  New York  and Massachusetts   On page 34 of the original report  Smith describes the location and role of the cadets during the first two weeks of June  In early June  in camp in Staunton  Va  following their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15    Having joined the corps in Staunton  I there received the orders of the adjutant general directing me to move the cadets to Richmond  to aid in the defense of the capital  Having reported to the governor and secretary of war  in obedience to orders  the cadets were assigned to the command of Maj  Gen  Ransom  and were encamped about two miles from the city limits  On the 5th June intelligence reached Richmond of the defeat of Gen  W E  Jones  near Staunton  and of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Valley towards Lexington  On the 6th orders were given to me to proceed to the Virginia Military Institute  if practicable  and take such measures  in cooperation with the confederate forces  or otherwise  as might be best for the defense of the public property at the Institute  The cadets were moved on the 7th  by the Danville rail road  to Lynchburg  reaching Lynchburg at 11 P M  Learning there that the enemy were advancing upon Lexington  and that Brig  Gen  McCausland was resisting their advance  I moved the cadets immediately  by freight boats  up the canal and they reached Lexington at 3 P M  on the 9th    On the 10th a dispatch was received by me from Gen  McCausland   image at left  that he had been strongly pressed by the enemy all day  and was then fighting with them on the Brownsburg road  near Brownsburg  By sundown he had been driven to Cameron s farm  two miles from Lexington  I had an interview with Gen  McCausland that night  I told him that if by a determined resistance he could  with the cooperation of the cadets  save Lexington  and with it the public property at the Virginia Military Institute  I was prepared to give him that cooperation at any sacrifice  But if a contest here could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  and result in the killing or capturing of the cadets  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think  with the strong force opposing him  that he could save the town  but under his advice  I determined to remain with the cadets on their ground  and hold them in readiness to cooperate with him  could this be done effectively  On the morning of the 11th the enemy advanced about 8 oclock  and three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills north of the town  McCausland having burned the bridge over the North river  planted a section of artillery on the magazine hill  and occupied the adjoining cliffs with sharpshooters  An active artillery and musketry fire from sharpshooters soon opened  and continued for several hours  The cadets were not engaged  and after waiting until 1 P M  and apprehending that the flanks of McCausland would be turned either by Hamilton s cross or Leyburn s fords  I gave orders to Lieut  Col  Ship to move the corps of cadets  by the fair ground road  and cross the North River by the bridge at its mouth  McCausland retired from Lexington about 3  and in about one hour after the enemy entered  The cadets remained near Balcony Falls from Saturday evening until Wednesday  and rendered good service in guarding the property of refugees  collected from the various counties of the Valley in that vicinity  Apprehending danger from the advance of the enemy into Bedford in pursuit of McCausland  and from a raid into Amherst

to be destroyed  my wife had not the help necessary to remove her children from the house  and was of course without the means of securing one article of her own furniture This statement is made to set a rest the baseless rumors in circulation  that my family was required to take the oath  that the rooms they occupied were searched by officials  that the house was tendered to Gen  Hunter as his headquarters to save it from destruction  or that they were called upon  in any way  to compromise their self respect Every species of public property was removed or wantonly destroyed  and among the most serious losses are to be named our valuable library the accumulated care of twenty five years and the philosophical apparatus  so long used by our late distinguished professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy  Lieut  General Thomas J  Jackson  The apparatus and many of the valuable books had been removed to Washington College  under the presumption that this venerable institution might afford a shelter and protection to them  But the work of destruction went on  The college building was sacked  the libraries of both institutions were destroyed  and every particle of philosophical apparatus broken to pieces  Shavings had been prepared to fire the college buildings also  and the design was only prevented by representations from some of the trustees  setting forth the purely civil organization of the college  and that it was the recipient of the bounty of Washington himself Our hospital was first rifled of all of its most valuable medical stores  and was then burnt  although one severely wounded cadet and one sick cadet  dependent upon both for comfort and almost for life  had to be removed from the building at great risk  in the midst of the shelling and the rifle balls of the sharpshooters The families of Colonels Williamson and Gilham were required by rude officials to vacate their quarters  and although they were allowed the privilege of removing their furniture  in part  through the kind interposition of the Hon  S  McD  Moore  few facilities were afforded them to do so  and the torch was applied while helpless females were endeavoring to save their little stores  and their quarters and many of their personal effects were destroyed Every public document connected with the operations of the institute  found in my office  and there were many copies of the various annual reports  and registers  was destroyed or removed 1  My private library was rifled of many of its most valuable and portable volumes  and the portraits of Ex Governors McDowell  Wise and Letcher  which occupied prominent positions in it  were removed 1 1 The houses of our poorest operatives  including seamstresses  laundresses and laborers  were searched  in common with those of the citizens generally  and some of these persons were left in a destitute and almost starving condition  The kindness of friends in Lexington had opened their houses to receive the trunks and effects of cadets  Such houses were made the peculiar objects of vindictive spoliation   Our shoe shop was despoiled of all of its leather and unfinished work  and the shoe lasts  implements and benches were there wantonly destroyed  The bell attached to our public clock was taken down and removed  and the beautiful bronze copy of Houdon s Washington  photo at left  by the gifted and lamented Hubard  after being mutilated in the effort to take it from its pedestal  was removed  Report has come in within the last few days  that the enemy being unable to transport this work of art through the mountain passes of Virginia  it was finally broken to pieces and destroyed 2 photo at left 2 2 All the regular Negro servants of the institution showed a marked fidelity  Our trusty baker  Anderson  the property of the institute  was stripped of everything  and on being asked whether he had made himself known as belonging to the state  promptly replied   No indeed if I had told the Yankees that  they would have burnt me up with the other state property I have been particular in the recital I have given of the conduct of the enemy tot his institution  because I desire to give permanence to the record of infamy which has immortalized the U  S  Army of Western Virginia here The Virginia Military Institute has sought no exemption from those evils which are inseparable from a state of war  In every way  directly and indirectly  in which it could be made tributary to the success of the life struggle in which our country is engaged  the contribution has been made heartily and in no stinted measure The corps of cadets prepared for the field  at Camp Lee  15 000 men of the army of first Manassas  and every battlefield has been hallowed by the blood of its sons  Every professor and every officer had his appointed work  and each  from the world renowned Jackson  has discharged his whole duty with earnestness and fidelity  When public expediency required the reopening of the school on the 1st of January 1862  its course of instruction was specially accommodated to make it auxiliary to our struggle  Munitions of war were prepared for the army in the field  The battalion of cadets was kept on a war footing  to resist the raids of the enemy  and has effectively aided in this important duty  Upon the call of the gallant Breckinridge  they were summoned to the battlefield at New Market  and fought with a gallantry which has marked them as the objects of peculiar hatred to the enemy  They were subsequently called  upon the requisition of the secretary of war  to assist in the defense of the capital of our state and Confederacy  and remained near Richmond until the advance of the enemy up the Valley of Virginia under Hunter  again threatened the Virginia Military Institute  They were promptly moved to the support of McCausland  but were unable  from the overpowering weight of numbers  to offer effectual resistance where they most desired to do so  under the walls of the institution itself  It was a painful sacrifice which required them to surrender the home of their cadet life without a struggle  But they were soon reunited to their victorious leader at Lynchburg  and there had the satisfaction of witnessing the discomfiture of the army of Hunter  and once more the standard of Virginia floats from the institute hill  So that in every possible way in which a military school could be made available to our patriotic cause  it has been fully and freely done No one  therefore  belonging to the institution can complain that the rules of war should be applied to an establishment marked by such evidences of identification with our revolutionary struggle  It was to have been expected that the cadets should be pursued  that they might be either killed or captured  They asked no immunities from the rigors of war meted to to others  The arms and munitions of war were proper subjects for capture or destruction  Its public buildings might have been held by the enemy as a barracks or hospital  and the school itself dispersed  But modern history is appealed to in vain for a like instance of devastation  as marked the track of the invader here General Hunter commanded an organized army of the United States  whose professed mission was the  restoration of the Union    and yet it was by his order  and against the remonstrances  as I understand  of some of his own general officers  that the public buildings of the Virginia Military Institute were committed to the flames  and the threat was made by him that the university of Virginia should soon share a like fate  he is not only responsible for an act deliberately executed  but for the effort clearly manifested to consign to utter destruction every record that could mark the character or history of being of the Virginia Military Institute  Not satisfied with desolation  its walls were polluted with the most obscene language in association with the names of men from Ohio  Pennsylvania  New York  and Massachusetts On page 34 of the original report  Smith describes the location and role of the cadets during the first two weeks of June  In early June  in camp in Staunton  Va  following their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15 On page 34 of the original report  Smith describes the location and role of the cadets during the first two weeks of June  In early June  in camp in Staunton  Va  following their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15 Battle of New Market Having joined the corps in Staunton  I there received the orders of the adjutant general directing me to move the cadets to Richmond  to aid in the defense of the capital  Having reported to the governor and secretary of war  in obedience to orders  the cadets were assigned to the command of Maj  Gen  Ransom  and were encamped about two miles from the city limits On the 5th June intelligence reached Richmond of the defeat of Gen  W E  Jones  near Staunton  and of the threatening aspect of affairs in the Valley towards Lexington  On the 6th orders were given to me to proceed to the Virginia Military Institute  if practicable  and take such measures  in cooperation with the confederate forces  or otherwise  as might be best for the defense of the public property at the Institute  The cadets were moved on the 7th  by the Danville rail road  to Lynchburg  reaching Lynchburg at 11 P M  Learning there that the enemy were advancing upon Lexington  and that Brig  Gen  McCausland was resisting their advance  I moved the cadets immediately  by freight boats  up the canal and they reached Lexington at 3 P M  on the 9th Brig  Gen  McCausland   On the 10th a dispatch was received by me from Gen  McCausland   image at left  that he had been strongly pressed by the enemy all day  and was then fighting with them on the Brownsburg road  near Brownsburg  By sundown he had been driven to Cameron s farm  two miles from Lexington  I had an interview with Gen  McCausland that night  I told him that if by a determined resistance he could  with the cooperation of the cadets  save Lexington  and with it the public property at the Virginia Military Institute  I was prepared to give him that cooperation at any sacrifice  But if a contest here could only retard the advance of the enemy a few hours  and result in the killing or capturing of the cadets  I was not willing to make such a sacrifice or run such a risk  Gen  McCausland did not think  with the strong force opposing him  that he could save the town  but under his advice  I determined to remain with the cadets on their ground  and hold them in readiness to cooperate with him  could this be done effectively image at left On the morning of the 11th the enemy advanced about 8 oclock  and three lines of their skirmishers occupied the hills north of the town  McCausland having burned the bridge over the North river  planted a section of artillery on the magazine hill  and occupied the adjoining cliffs with sharpshooters  An active artillery and musketry fire from sharpshooters soon opened  and continued for several hours  The cadets were not engaged  and after waiting until 1 P M  and apprehending that the flanks of McCausland would be turned either by Hamilton s cross or Leyburn s fords  I gave orders to Lieut  Col  Ship to move the corps of cadets  by the fair ground road  and cross the North River by the bridge at its mouth  McCausland retired from Lexington about 3  and in about one hour after the enemy entered The cadets remained near Balcony Falls from Saturday evening until Wednesday  and rendered good service in guarding the property of refugees  collected from the various counties of the Valley in that vicinity  Apprehending danger from the advance of the enemy into Bedford in pursuit of McCausland  and from a raid into Amherst  I ordered Col  Ship on the 15th to move the cadets by freight boats to Lynchburg  A courier from Gen  Breckinridge at Lynchburg met me on the way  and brought me instructions to move immediately to Lynchburg  and take the north side of the river  As the command had already passed Waugh s ferry  the danger apprehended by General Breckinridge no longer existed  and the cadets reached Lynchburg safely the next morning at 8 o clock  and I immediately reported to Gen  Breckinridge  and also to the governor and board of visitors  The cadets remained in camp near Lynchburg until after the repulse of Hunter  and on the 24th June  under instructions received from the board of visitors  the cadets were ordered back to Lexington  and reached there on the 25th  Having failed to procure the tents which had been ordered upon the requisition of the adjutant general  the cadets occupied temporarily the buildings of Washington college  which had been kindly placed at their disposal Finding  upon examination  that most of our commissary stores had been destroyed or taken by the enemy that the public property was in a state of utter ruin I deemed it my duty to place all the cadets who were able to reach their homes  or the homes of their friends  on furlough until the 1st of September  and to make provision to take care of the remainder as well as my means would enable me  Under these orders  all the cadets  except some three or four  are now on furlough In the mean time I have employed all the operatives of the institution in gathering up the valuable material found in the ruins  placing the same in a place of security  I have also rented a store in Lexington for the deposit of quartermaster and commissary stores and have been endeavoring to collect such property as may have passed into the hand of parties not entitled to claim or to hold it The board will be enabled to see  in the course of their sitting  what has been done in these respects  and will be the better qualified  by personal inspection  to give me instructions in regard thereto 1 Despite the dire tone of this sentence  almost all of VMI s records survived the Civil War  The Institute s archives are very complete  and there are no significant gaps  2 The rumor concerning the destruction of the statue was false  It was successfully transported to Wheeling  West Virginia  where it was placed on display  At the end of the war  it was returned to VMI and was  reinaugurated  on September 10  1866  The photo on this page was taken in 1866  around the time of the statue s rededication ceremony   1 1  2 2 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI
