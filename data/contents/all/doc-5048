Symposium GEN J H  Binford Peay  III Superintendent 9 11 April 2013 Ladies and gentlemen  Good afternoon  Welcome to the Virginia Military Institute for this  the 24th annual Environment Virginia Symposium  VMI is proud to be the home of this important annual event  and in that context we remember and pay tribute to the man who conceived the Environment Virginia Symposium  CAPT Ronald A  Erchul  who passed away in 2011  From a research project and a grant from the Virginia Environmental Endowment  this annual statewide event has grown in size and importance to the point where over 650 professionals representing diverse interests now typically attend  We are fortunate to have with us a group of distinguished leaders who will address opportunities and possible solutions to the environmental challenges facing the Commonwealth  In a few moments  they will be introduced to you  but before we begin that part of the program  I would like to take this opportunity to make several acknowledgements  First  I would like to thank Governor McDonnell  now in the last year of his administration  for his steadfast support of efforts to protect Virginia s environment and the appropriate development and use of Virginia s natural resources for the enjoyment and prosperity of the citizens of the Commonwealth  Governor McDonnell addressed this Symposium in April 2010  and members of his staff have participated in all the sessions since he took office  I would especially like to thank the Honorable Doug Domenech  DOM i netch  Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources  who was our principal speaker last year  and welcome him back to VMI  He will speak at the Plenary Session tomorrow along with Mr  David Paylor  Director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year  Another speaker who will participate in tomorrow s Plenary Session is the Honorable Paul D  Fraim  Mayor of the City of Norfolk  Mayor Fraim is no stranger to VMI as he is a graduate of the Class of 1971 and currently serves as the President of the VMI Board of Visitors  I also want to acknowledge the significant accomplishments of Mr  Gerald McCarthy  who will retire shortly as Executive Director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment  His experience includes more than three decades of work  serving as the first executive director of the Governor s Council on the Environment  for Governor Linwood Holton  and later as chairman and administrator of the State Council on Environment  for Governor Mills Godwin  Subsequently he served as the first and only Executive Director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment  We thank him for his leadership and wish him well in retirement  I also welcome his replacement  Mr  Joseph Maroon  who is no stranger to the Environment Virginia Symposium  He has participated here many times as the Virginia Director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and as the Director of the Virginia Department of Conservation  He is a recipient of the Environment Virginia Environmental Leadership Award  which has since been named for Captain Erchul  For two decades  this gathering has provided an important  forum  for examining the relationship between careful stewardship of the environment and Virginia s natural resources  and economic development for the prosperity and well being of the citizens of the Commonwealth  This year s theme   Charting Our Future  New Tools for Complex Challenges  sets the stage for sessions that will look into the future  At concurrent sessions on  Future Visioning  led by the Department of Environmental Quality  attendees will be asked to identify critical challenges that lay ahead for the Commonwealth  Another session will see the introduction of the  UVA Bay Game  a state of the art tool that engages players in designing collaborative solutions  There are always challenges when it comes to the environment  Notable among these are the effects of climate change  balancing the protection of the environment with the reasonable use of natural resources  and adequate funding for the job to be done  Today  because of the economic downturn we have sustained over the past five years  environmental stewardship has become even more challenging  Federal  state  and local budget reductions in Virginia have put pressure on funding for transportation  infrastructure  and K 12 public education  These constraints have forced the administration in Richmond and citizens in general to make tough choices about where limited taxpayer dollars should be directed  Sequestration has added to the challenge  This Symposium  as can be said for those that have preceded it  addresses the fiscal challenges that are shaping long term environmental priorities  I am especially glad to see that schools and colleges across our Commonwealth and across the nation are responding to the challenges facing us  Our colleges and universities are incorporating environmental concerns into many of their disciplines  The Virginia Military Institute prizes its strong environmental program in the sciences and engineering  and we are committed to the goal of educating leaders of character for the future  On behalf of the faculty  staff  and cadets of VMI  I extend to you a very warm welcome  I hope you have an enjoyable time at this symposium  and in historic Lexington  It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr  William Gill  who will introduce this morning s speaker  Mr  Gill is a Virginia Tech graduate and licensed professional engineer  He serves as a member of the symposium program advisory committee  He has worked for Smithfield Foods for more than 20 years  holding various project engineering and environmental positions  and is currently

April 2013 Ladies and gentlemen  Good afternoon  Welcome to the Virginia Military Institute for this  the 24th annual Environment Virginia Symposium  VMI is proud to be the home of this important annual event  and in that context we remember and pay tribute to the man who conceived the Environment Virginia Symposium  CAPT Ronald A  Erchul  who passed away in 2011  From a research project and a grant from the Virginia Environmental Endowment  this annual statewide event has grown in size and importance to the point where over 650 professionals representing diverse interests now typically attend  We are fortunate to have with us a group of distinguished leaders who will address opportunities and possible solutions to the environmental challenges facing the Commonwealth  In a few moments  they will be introduced to you  but before we begin that part of the program  I would like to take this opportunity to make several acknowledgements  First  I would like to thank Governor McDonnell  now in the last year of his administration  for his steadfast support of efforts to protect Virginia s environment and the appropriate development and use of Virginia s natural resources for the enjoyment and prosperity of the citizens of the Commonwealth  Governor McDonnell addressed this Symposium in April 2010  and members of his staff have participated in all the sessions since he took office  I would especially like to thank the Honorable Doug Domenech  DOM i netch  Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources  who was our principal speaker last year  and welcome him back to VMI  He will speak at the Plenary Session tomorrow along with Mr  David Paylor  Director of the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality  which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year  Another speaker who will participate in tomorrow s Plenary Session is the Honorable Paul D  Fraim  Mayor of the City of Norfolk  Mayor Fraim is no stranger to VMI as he is a graduate of the Class of 1971 and currently serves as the President of the VMI Board of Visitors  I also want to acknowledge the significant accomplishments of Mr  Gerald McCarthy  who will retire shortly as Executive Director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment  His experience includes more than three decades of work  serving as the first executive director of the Governor s Council on the Environment  for Governor Linwood Holton  and later as chairman and administrator of the State Council on Environment  for Governor Mills Godwin  Subsequently he served as the first and only Executive Director of the Virginia Environmental Endowment  We thank him for his leadership and wish him well in retirement  I also welcome his replacement  Mr  Joseph Maroon  who is no stranger to the Environment Virginia Symposium  He has participated here many times as the Virginia Director of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and as the Director of the Virginia Department of Conservation  He is a recipient of the Environment Virginia Environmental Leadership Award  which has since been named for Captain Erchul  For two decades  this gathering has provided an important  forum  for examining the relationship between careful stewardship of the environment and Virginia s natural resources  and economic development for the prosperity and well being of the citizens of the Commonwealth  This year s theme   Charting Our Future  New Tools for Complex Challenges  sets the stage for sessions that will look into the future  At concurrent sessions on  Future Visioning  led by the Department of Environmental Quality  attendees will be asked to identify critical challenges that lay ahead for the Commonwealth  Another session will see the introduction of the  UVA Bay Game  a state of the art tool that engages players in designing collaborative solutions  There are always challenges when it comes to the environment  Notable among these are the effects of climate change  balancing the protection of the environment with the reasonable use of natural resources  and adequate funding for the job to be done  Today  because of the economic downturn we have sustained over the past five years  environmental stewardship has become even more challenging  Federal  state  and local budget reductions in Virginia have put pressure on funding for transportation  infrastructure  and K 12 public education  These constraints have forced the administration in Richmond and citizens in general to make tough choices about where limited taxpayer dollars should be directed  Sequestration has added to the challenge  This Symposium  as can be said for those that have preceded it  addresses the fiscal challenges that are shaping long term environmental priorities  I am especially glad to see that schools and colleges across our Commonwealth and across the nation are responding to the challenges facing us  Our colleges and universities are incorporating environmental concerns into many of their disciplines  The Virginia Military Institute prizes its strong environmental program in the sciences and engineering  and we are committed to the goal of educating leaders of character for the future  On behalf of the faculty  staff  and cadets of VMI  I extend to you a very warm welcome  I hope you have an enjoyable time at this symposium  and in historic Lexington  It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr  William Gill  who will introduce this morning s speaker  Mr  Gill is a Virginia Tech graduate and licensed professional engineer  He serves as a member of the symposium program advisory committee  He has worked for Smithfield Foods for more than 20 years  holding various project engineering and environmental positions  and is currently Assistant Vice President for Environmental Affairs at Smithfield Foods
