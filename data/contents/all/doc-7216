Security Use Policy Effective 1 June 2007 Purpose The purpose of this policy is to establish standards of secure use for removable data storage media  hereafter referred to as removable media  when sensitive data is involved    This standard applies to all VMI network users with regard to removable media including floppy disks  USB drives  CDs  DVDs  and any other physical media available used to transport data  Definitions Removable Media  CDs  DVDs  magnetic tapes  floppy disks  external hard drives  universal serial bus  USB  drives  also known as memory sticks  jump drives and thumb drives  and any other storage media intended for data portability separate from the system on which it originated  Sensitive data  Data with the highest level of protection including  but not limited to  data protected by law  data protected under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974  FERPA  data protected by legal contracts  security related data such as passwords  data containing personal information such as medical records  social security numbers  or other data which if available to unauthorized users  may harm an individual  group  or the Institute  Standards Removable media is commonly used to transfer electronic files from one computer to another  and as a mechanism to archive data  Security controls in place on VMI systems typically do not follow the data when it is copied to removable media  Users who place sensitive data on removable media must be aware of the security risks and recognize their responsibilities to protect the data  Removable media is typically small  portable  and more easily misplaced than permanent storage devices  Because of the nature of removable media a higher risk exists for inappropriate disclosure if the media is used to store sensitive data  Sensitive data should not be stored  even temporarily  on the internal hard drive of a laptop computer  If a laptop is to be used to work with sensitive data  the data should be stored on encrypted removable media  The following safeguards should be observed to protected Sensitive data stored on removable media  Users should avoid storage of sensitive data on
