   VMI Again Selected for Rose Parade The VMI Regimental Band and Pipes marches in the 2008 Rose Parade    File photo courtesy of Col  John Brodie  LEXINGTON  Va  Sept  29  2014   For only the second time in recent history  the combined VMI Regimental Band and Pipe Band have been selected to appear in the Tournament of Roses Parade  to be held on Jan  1  2016  in Pasadena  Calif   We re really excited about going again  said Col  John Brodie  band director  who led the band on its inaugural trip to the Rose Parade in 2008   It s a big honor for the band and for the school  Brodie explained that because so many organizations want to appear in the Rose Parade  the organizing committee asks that a group only apply once every four years  This time  the VMI band was selected from more than 100 bands around the country  For the 2016 application  Brodie sent a packet that included a video clip of the band s 2008 parade performance  along with letters of recommendation from Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  62  Institute superintendent  and Ellen Carroll  a retired federal judge who was a member of the 2008 Rose Bowl music committee   I think being there before really helped us out  said Brodie  From the perspective of the Rose Parade  the VMI band is unusual  Brodie explained  The Rose Parade does not have other bands that include pipes  Approximately 140 members of Band Company will be making the trip to Pasadena in late December 2015  Brodie said that in addition to marching in the parade  there will be time for sightseeing  and a gathering with West Coast VMI alumni is planned as well  Preparations for this parade  one of the oldest and most prestigious in the country  take several months  With Maj  Burt Mitchell  pipe band director  Brodie plans to fly to Pasadena to observe the 2015 Rose Bowl Parade  At some point in 2016  Tournament of Roses President Mike Matthiessen and his wife  Ann Matthiessen  will travel to VMI to watch a parade and assist with fundraising   VMI VMI Again Selected for Rose Parade The VMI Regimental Band and Pipes marches in the 2008 Rose Parade    File photo courtesy of Col  John Brodie  The VMI Regimental Band and Pipes
