Robo Tick Home Teaching Research Student Pages Personal The Problem Lyme disease has been on a steady increase for over a decade  The bacteria responsible for transmitting the disease immunosuppresses the infected tick  causing it to become a potential carrier of other diseases  and a similar rise in tick vectored illnesses have been reported by the CDC for Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever  Ehrlichiosis  and Babesiosis  The most common way to remove ticks from homes is to spray with the insecticide Permethrin  While this is extremely effective  it can also be dangerous  Permethrin is known to be toxic to fish  certain birds  cats  and some other animals  It is illegal in most states to spray it near streams for fear of runoff contaminating the water  A recent study funded by the US Army Medical Research Command shows permethrin is likely implicated in causing Gulf War Syndrome  Ticks are not distributed evenly over their habitat  instead they tend to disproportionately crowd a relatively narrow band at the junction of forest and lawn  This area  called the ecotone  is just roughly 10 feet wide and is the site of most human tick interactions  A  Robot tic  Solution   We developed a method to reduce tick population using robotics  We placed a hollow tube through the ecotone surrounding the property to be protected that emits CO2 through small holes drilled in its wall  Since the ticks are naturally attracted to CO2  the ticks consolidate from the ecotone to within a few inches of the tube  The tube also houses a wire that emits a low frequency magnetic field  We constructed a robot that is able to track that magnetic field and slowly travels around the tubing  dragging a denim skirt infused with permethrin  The ticks sense the vibration and slightly elevated  friction induced temperature of the skirt and attach to it  Although they recognize the skirt has no blood and detach within a few minutes  they will have already absorbed a toxic level of permethrin and will die within a few hours  Virtually no permethrin is left in the environment  except for trace amounts leeched from from the skirt and in the dead tick bodies  The top photo shows some of an

third generation is a huge improvement  mechanically it is far more robust  can generate three times the torque  and is designed using CNC equipment so it can be mass produced  Electronically it has improved navigation and speed control algorithms  and is simpler to operate since its onboard computer performs calibration functions that previously had to be set manually  A closeup of its penumatic hydraulic front end is shown below  Publications and Media Gaff H  White A  Leas K  Kelman P  Squire J C  Livingston D  Sullivan G  Baker E  and Sonenshine D  TickBot  A Novel Robotic Device for

test of the Generation III robot showing it s considerable torque and four wheel steering  The slight pause you see when it encounters an obstacle is not because it is torque limited  but rather because it is computing the correct amount of torque to apply to maintain a constant speed  It updates these calculations roughly one hundred times per second  Your browser does not support HTML5
