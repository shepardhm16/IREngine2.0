 David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Camp near Staunton  Va  June 8  1864   GENERAL  I have the honor to report that on my arrival at Harrisonburg  on the afternoon of the 2d instant  I found the enemy occupying a strong intrenched position at Mount Crawford  on the North River  where it is crossed by the Valley turnpike  his right at Rockland Mills  and his left at Bridgewater  I spent the following day in ascertaining the enemy s force and position  and early on the morning of the 4th  after sending a force of cavalry to amuse him  I moved my column by a side road and crossed the Shenandoah at Port Republic  This movement was so little expected that we found a large supply train of the enemy at this place  and our advance cavalry captured a part of it  with supplies and horses  I encamped about one mile south of Port Republic  and on the morning of the 5th  at an early hour  advanced on the Staunton road  At 6 a m  my advanced cavalry met that of the enemy  and after a sharp skirmish drove them  with a loss of 75 men killed  wounded  and missing  At the village of Piedmont  seven miles southwest of Port Republic  I found the enemy in force advantageously posted  The battle opened with artillery at 9 a m  the enemy using several guns of long range and heavy caliber  At 10 o clock the First Brigade of Infantry  under Colonel Moor  advanced on our right and drove the enemy from his advanced position in a wood behind his line of defenses constructed of fallen timber and fence rails  Colonel Thoburn  with the Second Brigade of Infantry  took position on elevated ground on our left  supporting the batteries and ready for action where most needed  At 11 30 the fine practice of our artillery had silenced the enemy s batteries  and the cavalry  under Major General Stahel  was massed in rear of the infantry on our right  At 1 o clock the First Brigade attacked the enemy s line in front  but failed to carry it  and fell back after a spirited contest  At 1 30 the enemy was observed to be massing his force on our right  opposite the first Brigade  and orders were immediately sent to Colonel Thoburn to move his brigade across the open valley between  and attack the enemy s position in flank  At 2 p m  the enemy made a determined attack on the First Brigade  which gallantly sustained itself  assisted by Von Kleiser s battery and a cross fire from Morton s and Carlin s batteries on our left  Meanwhile Thoburn s brigade  having crossed the valley  fell upon the enemy s exposed flank with decisive effect  crushing his whole line and driving a portion of his force over the steep bank into the river  which covered his left  Simultaneously Colonel Moor s brigade rushed over the works in front  and a brigade of cavalry  under Colonel Wynkoop  charged upon his right flank and rear  The enemy fled in confusion  leaving over 1 000 prisoners in our hands  including 60 officers  The killed and wounded are estimated at 600 men  Brig  Gen  William E  Jones  commanding forces  was killed on the field and his body fell into our hands  From papers found upon his person it is ascertained that the enemy s force was between 6 000 and 7 000 men  and 16 guns  among them two 20 pounder Parrotts  and one 24 pounder howitzer  In addition to his loss upon the field  the enemy in his precipitate retreat lost an equal number at least by straggling and desertion  General Vaughn  upon whom the command devolved  fell back upon Waynesborough with the wreck of his army  On the next day  June 6  I occupied Staunton without opposition  capturing 400 sick and wounded  who were paroled  and large quantities of commissary and

force under General McCausland and Col  William L  Jackson  stationed at Buffalo Gap  to oppose the advance of General Crook  on hearing of our occupation of Staunton  fell back precipitately and

William E  Jones  commanding forces  was killed on the field and his body fell into our hands  From papers found upon his person it is ascertained that the enemy s force was between 6 000 and 7 000 men  and 16 guns  among them two 20 pounder Parrotts  and one 24 pounder howitzer  In addition to his loss upon the field  the enemy in his precipitate retreat lost an equal number at least by straggling and desertion  General Vaughn  upon whom the command devolved  fell back upon Waynesborough with the wreck of his army  On the next day  June 6  I occupied Staunton without opposition  capturing 400 sick and wounded  who were paroled  and large quantities of commissary and ordnance stores  which were destroyed or distributed among the troops  All the railroad bridges and depots  and public workshops and factories in the town and vicinity  were also destroyed  A rebel force under General McCausland and Col  William L  Jackson  stationed at Buffalo Gap  to oppose the advance of General Crook  on hearing of our occupation of Staunton  fell back precipitately and escaped southward  General Crook  with his whole command  in fine condition  joined me to day  having brushed away the enemy s corps of observation and destroyed the Virginia Central Railroad west of this place  These results have been accomplished with a loss to this command of less than 500 men in killed and wounded  On the march and in action the troops have behaved admirably  The combined force  now in fine spirits and condition  will move day after to morrow to the accomplishment of its mission  I am

Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Camp near Staunton  Va  June 8  1864   GENERAL  I have the honor to report that on my arrival at Harrisonburg  on the afternoon of the 2d instant  I found the enemy occupying a strong intrenched position at Mount Crawford  on the North River  where it is crossed by the Valley turnpike  his right at Rockland Mills  and his left at Bridgewater  I spent the following day in ascertaining the enemy s force and position  and early on the morning of the 4th  after sending a force of cavalry to amuse him  I moved my column by a side road and crossed the Shenandoah at Port Republic  This movement was so little expected that we found a large supply train of the enemy at this place  and our advance cavalry captured a part of it  with supplies and horses  I encamped about one mile south of Port Republic  and on the morning of the 5th  at an early hour  advanced on the Staunton road  At 6 a m  my advanced cavalry met that of the enemy  and after a sharp skirmish drove them  with a loss of 75 men killed  wounded  and missing  At the village of Piedmont  seven miles southwest of Port Republic  I found the enemy in force advantageously posted  The battle opened with artillery at 9 a m  the enemy using several guns of long range and heavy caliber  At 10 o clock the First Brigade of Infantry  under Colonel Moor  advanced on our right and drove the enemy from his advanced position in a wood behind his line of defenses constructed of fallen timber and fence rails  Colonel Thoburn  with the Second Brigade of Infantry  took position on elevated ground on our left  supporting the batteries and ready for action where most needed  At 11 30 the fine practice of our artillery had silenced the enemy s batteries  and the cavalry  under Major General Stahel  was massed in rear of the infantry on our right  At 1 o clock the First Brigade attacked the enemy s line in front  but failed to carry it  and fell back after a spirited contest  At 1 30 the enemy was observed to be massing his force on our right  opposite the first Brigade  and orders were immediately sent to Colonel Thoburn to move his brigade across the open valley between  and attack the enemy s position in flank  At 2 p m  the enemy made a determined attack on the First Brigade  which gallantly sustained itself  assisted by Von Kleiser s battery and a cross fire from Morton s and Carlin s batteries on our left  Meanwhile Thoburn s brigade  having crossed the valley  fell upon the enemy s exposed flank with decisive effect  crushing his whole line and driving a portion of his force over the steep bank into the river  which covered his left  Simultaneously Colonel Moor s brigade rushed over the works in front  and a brigade of cavalry  under Colonel Wynkoop  charged upon his right flank and rear  The enemy fled in confusion  leaving over 1 000 prisoners in our hands  including 60 officers  The killed and wounded are estimated at 600 men  Brig  Gen  William E  Jones  commanding forces  was killed on the field and his body fell into our hands  From papers found upon his person it is ascertained that the enemy s force was between 6 000 and 7 000 men  and 16 guns  among them two 20 pounder Parrotts  and one 24 pounder howitzer  In
