ecology of invertebrate animals  While my primary research interest is in the evolution and diversity of free living nematodes  students in my lab also conduct research on other invertebrates  especially parasites  Free living marine nematodes Marine sediments support by far the greatest diversity of nematode species  and I aim to understand their diversity  evoluton  and taxonomy  Parasite ecology and evolution My students and I study a variety of parasitic worms  We have examined the diversity and distribution of leeches infecting turtles  the community of parasites in muskrats  and
