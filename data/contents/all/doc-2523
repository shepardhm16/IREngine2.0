Photo by Kelly Nye  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2014   Ronald Reagan s policies didn t drive the Soviet Union to capitulation  but rather set the stage for a negotiated end to the Cold War  said Jack F

special assistant for national security affairs to President Ronald Reagan and U S  ambassador to the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the breakup of the Soviet Union  spoke last night of partnership between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  former Soviet Politburo General Secretary  The talk took place at a dinner in Marshall Hall for participants in the conference   The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs During the Ronald Reagan Era  Matlock  who had previously served as the U S  ambassador to Czechoslovakia  drew upon firsthand knowledge to correct what he said were common misunderstandings about the foreign policy of the Reagan presidency  He outlined the president s framework for negotiations with Gorbachev  tying in lessons for application in today s political landscape  The primary strategy  he explained  was cooperation  not confrontation   Negotiations backed by strength brought the Cold War to an end  not military and economic pressure alone  Reagan s approach  said Matlock  was governed by three principles  realism  strength  and dialogue  He applied these principles to work toward his goals  which included reducing the number of nuclear weapons  respect for human rights  and improving the working relationship between the two countries  Challenging the legitimacy of the Soviet government  gaining military superiority  or forcing the collapse of the Soviet Union  said Matlock  were never on the agenda  though three events occurring in sequence often led people to think otherwise  the Cold War ended  the Communist Party lost control of the Soviet Union  and the Soviet Union shattered into 15 independent states  While there are some causal relationships among the three events  they do not relate to U S  diplomatic goals under Reagan   They are connected  but separate  he explained   Do not confuse three events with one   the end of the Cold War   The idea that we won the Cold War and they lost the Cold War    that we forced the breakup of the Soviet Union  trying to isolate Russia   the opposite is true  Matlock said   The Cold War ended not in victory by one side or the other  it ended in negotiation to the advantage of everyone  he explained  He said that Reagan negotiated from the knowledge that the arms race was  robbing  both countries  causing enormous investments in weapons that could never be used  For both countries   and both leaders understood this    It would have been a disaster if they had been  used  It was Reagan s willingness to talk to the people in power as people  and to find common ground for partnership  that opened the way to success  These principles are still needed in the diplomacy of today  Matlock said  The two day conference resumed this morning at 8 30 with panel

Soviet Union to capitulation  but rather set the stage for a negotiated end to the Cold War  said Jack F  Matlock Jr  whose roles in the policy and diplomatic maneuverings of the 1980s gave him a front row seat for the peaceful end to the 40 year military standoff  Former Ambassador Matlock  who was special assistant for national security affairs to President Ronald Reagan and U S  ambassador to the Soviet Union during the years leading up to the breakup of the Soviet Union  spoke last night of partnership between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev  former Soviet Politburo General Secretary  The talk took place at a dinner in Marshall Hall for participants in the conference   The Enduring Legacy  Leadership and National Security Affairs During the Ronald Reagan Era  Matlock  who had previously served as the U S  ambassador to Czechoslovakia  drew upon firsthand knowledge to correct what he said were common misunderstandings about the foreign policy of the Reagan presidency  He outlined the president s framework for negotiations with Gorbachev  tying in lessons for application in today s political landscape  The primary strategy  he explained  was cooperation  not confrontation   Negotiations backed by strength brought the Cold War to an end  not military and economic pressure alone  Reagan s approach  said Matlock  was governed by three principles  realism  strength  and dialogue  He applied these principles to work toward his goals  which included reducing the number of nuclear weapons  respect for human rights  and improving the working relationship between the two countries  Challenging the legitimacy of the Soviet government  gaining military superiority  or forcing the collapse of the Soviet Union  said Matlock  were never on the agenda  though three events occurring in sequence often led people to think otherwise  the Cold War ended  the Communist Party lost control of the Soviet Union  and the Soviet Union shattered into 15 independent states  While there are some causal relationships among the three events  they do not relate to U S  diplomatic goals under Reagan   They are connected  but separate  he explained   Do not

opposite is true  Matlock said   The Cold War ended not in victory by one side or the other  it ended in negotiation to the advantage of everyone  he explained  He said that Reagan negotiated from the knowledge that the arms race was  robbing  both countries  causing enormous investments in weapons that could never be used  For both countries   and both leaders understood this    It would have been a disaster if they had been  used  It was Reagan s willingness to talk to the people in power as people  and to find common ground for partnership  that opened the way to success  These principles are still needed in the diplomacy of today  Matlock said  The two day conference resumed this morning at 8 30 with panel discussions scheduled until noon    Daniel Stinnett  07  VMI Communications
