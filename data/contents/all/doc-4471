Championships in the spring  The club recently took 27 lifters to the Virginia State Championships in Vienna and 17 of them  including 10 state champions  returned to Lexington with national qualifying totals  the most in recent memory  at least since VMI Police Lt  David Henson became coach four years ago   This is the most we ve had qualify in one meet in a while  said Henson  who noted that 15 lifters advanced to the national tournament at last year s state meet   The guys did really well this year  They are hard working  Whenever we had the gym doors open  they were in there  To earn a trip to the national tournament  lifters had to amass a qualifying cumulative weight total  determined for each weight class and spread out among three lifts  the bench press  the squat and the deadlift   It s not easy to qualify for nationals  Henson said   There are so many powerlifters who don t get to go to nationals  It s not something  for which  you can just walk into the gym  train for a few months  and then get a qualifying total  Eric Johnson  16  the cadet in charge  and Salena Chiep  16  the first female assistant cadet in charge for the club  were among VMI s first place finishers  Johnson had one of the most impressive meets  amassing 1 578 pounds in the 205 pound weight class  At 114 pounds  Chiep lifted a total of 550 pounds  Mackenzie Harrmann  16 was among the other 1st Class cadets to turn in a first place effort  amassing 765 pounds at 138  Also placing first were Stephen Guse  16  1 056 pounds at 145  Josh Bowen  16  1 369 pounds at 182  and Michael Coppalino  16  1 084 pounds at 163  Competing in her first tournament  Mia Cangiano  18 finished with a total of 694 pounds to win the 158 pound weight class  Natalie Carroll  17 took first place at 125 with a total of 694 pounds  while Wyatt Fagan  18 totaled 1 298 pounds to win at 231  Emma Nobile  17  at 138  rounded out the list of VMI winners with her total of 512 pounds  Four members of the VMI squad placed second  Kenny Yuan  17 was the runner up at 145 with a 924 pound total  and Matthew Derito  16 lifted 1 204 pounds to place second at 182  Zach Holland  17  1 067 total  was second at 163  and Cody Ellis  17  1 243  was second at 205  William Mayes  17  1 221 at 182  Jason Poling  17  1 204 at 163  and Zack Taylor  17  1 045 at 163  rounded out VMI s list of qualifiers with their third place efforts  That s the list of VMI qualifiers   for now  The team  which is 50 members strong   one of the largest club sports teams on post   will compete in the Winter Classic in Pennsylvania in February  with those who have not qualified getting a last chance to earn a spot in the national tournament   I anticipate at least 25 going to nationals this year  said Henson   In the past we ve had kids win national championships  and we ve got a couple of kids on the team  who can win this year  The national tournament will be held April 14 17 in Providence  R I  Followers of the team can watch the national championships via live stream at the USA Powerlifting website   Chris Floyd  VMI    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX
