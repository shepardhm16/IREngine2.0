Contact ECBU Contact ECBU Courses EC306  International Economics The study of international trade focuses on transactions that  involve a physical movement of goods or a tangible commitment of economic resources   Krugman and Obstfeld  p  8  International trade uses the standard tools of economic analysis  It deals with interaction between sovereign states  and as such  it also focuses on government policies and examines their effect on international trade patterns The objective of the course is  therefore  to familiarize you with some of the key economic tools that can be used to analyze international trade related issues  We will examine various theories of trade  welfare implications of different trade policies  the political economy of trade policies  global trading arrangements  including GATT and WTO  the relationship between trade and various social and political issues  Some questions that we will seek to answer are  Why do countries trade  Why do countries use or abuse trade policy  Is trade always beneficial  EC202  Principles of Macroeconomics This course provides an introduction to the field of macroeconomics  i e  the study of the economy as a whole  Since macroeconomic conditions affect everyone in the economy  macroeconomics plays a key role in political debates and has particular relevance to public policy  The course will introduce the basic concepts and tools of macroeconomics and illustrate their applications to real world policy  It is designed to provide students with a framework that can be used to analyze aggregate  economy wide  issues such as unemployment  growth rate  inflation  and monetary and fiscal policy    EC435XW  Institutions and Economic Development   C C course Institutions are  humanly devised constraints that structure political  economic and social interactions   North 1991  p  97  They consist of formal rules  constitutions  laws  political systems  and informal constraints  social norms  customs  religious beliefs  trust  While formal rules can be changed quickly  informal constraints possess significant inertia and evolve over long periods of time  Moreover  a successful institutional arrangement requires a fit between formal rules and informal constraints  This course s objective is to explore what the determinants of institutions are  how institutions evolve  and how institutions affect economic development  Some specific questions the course will address are  How do differences between the common law and the civil law systems affect patterns of economic development  What is the significance of a country s colonial origin for present day economic performance  Do religious beliefs matter for economic growth  How does trust in political institutions or in people in general affect economic development  Does transplantation of formal institutions work or should countries develop indigenous institutions  Does international aid help or harm economic and institutional development  What are the origins of corruption and why is it more prevalent in some cultures than in others  Lt  Col  Valentina Dimitrova Grajzl Home Courses Curriculum Vita Research Links
