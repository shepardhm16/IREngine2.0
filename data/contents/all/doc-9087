Personal Home West Point Commission MIOBC Gulf HS Teach MIT My Roots I was born in London  England and lived in Sydney  Australia and Auckland  New Zealand before coming to America in the fourth grade  I mostly consider myself from New York since I lived 8 years there by the Finger Lakes and just north of New York City  although since arriving in the U S  I ve also lived in Phoenix  Denver  Ft  Monmouth  NJ  and Cambridge  MA  Military I was known as Jungle Jim as a cadet in West Point  I d like to think it was because I went to Jungle School in Panama  but it was really a comment on my room inspections  I commissioned as a lieutenant in the Military Intelligence Corps and went to the Military Intelligence Officers Basic Course in Sierra Vista  AZ  My first assignment was in the Gulf War  here are some haunting images from postwar Kuwait  High School Teacher I left the Army to go to MIT  but had a six month interlude teaching science and mathematics in Central Jersey Christian High School  This school was incredible  It was amazing to see how much young men and women can learn in a centered  loving environment  I cherished teaching there and nearly decided to stay rather than go to grad school  M I T  and Consulting At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology I began as a teaching assistant for Steve Burns  whose ability to fabricate low cost biomedical equipment for third world countries sparked my interest in bioengineering  I became a research assistant for Elazer Edelman and developed mathematical models and instrumentation to discover how endovascular stents expand  Stents are essentially pencil lead thick hollow slotted tubes that are threaded inside atherosclerotic arteries  Most are then expanded by a small balloon  although some self expand  and remain permanently inside the artery to scaffold it open  They have revolutionized cardiac health care  although approved by the FDA for only a decade they already account for nearly a million procedures per year in the US alone  Unfortunately  their very popularity has brought many legal suits in an effort to monopolize the stent manufacturing business  and towards the end of my doctorate I worked as an engineering consultant for legal firms to prevent this from occurring  Virginia Military Institute I teach in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at VMI  a four year college known for its engineering program and for its history of graduating military officers  Like the service academies  academics are the primary goal and cadets are taught in a military environment that fosters teamwork  confidence  and personal responsibility  Unlike the service academies  nearly all the faculty hold doctorates and average more than ten year s teaching experience  I teach Introduction to Electrical Engineering  Circuits II  Signals and Systems  Digital Signal Processing  a hybrid seminar industry elective  and also advise many independent study projects including the ones shown here in pages created by cadets  My Home I married Laura on a sunny day at West Point in 1990  this is me and my best man  and best friend  apart from Laura  Frank Illuzzi waiting for her to show on the church steps well over two decades ago  We have two boys  Kevin and Ryan  who are involved in more activities than I can possibly list  My sons and I earned black belts from the American Freestyle Karate Lexington studio  here are some of the katas for those affiliated with the studio  We also have Suzi  a Lab ish stray that found us through Wade Bell when she was about 4 months old  and Pattie the Pug who showed up on our driveway one morning and never left  We are members of St  Patrick Church in Lexington  For fun I invent things with my kids that occasionally don t explode  co manage several startups like this  and play keyboards in the classic rock The Coprolite Band
