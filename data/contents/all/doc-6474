LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  5  2014   The Hall Poindexter House was demolished this morning in preparation for the construction of the New Indoor Training Facility at the intersection of Diamond and Main streets  Phase I of VMI s Corps Physical Training Facilities project  expected to be completed in July 2016  The house was constructed in 1877 as part of a group of six similar houses known as Preston Row  It has not been used as a residence since the 1970s and most recently housed a first floor barbershop before its sale to VMI in 2005  The structure was once a part of the historic Diamond Hill neighborhood  and likely housed members of Lexington s African American community from its construction and through much of the 1900s  Before planning to demolish the house  VMI s construction office made efforts to find a party willing to acquire and relocate it   We offered the Hall Poindexter House up for sale to anyone who wanted to relocate it  and they had to present a plan on how and where they were going to move it  said Col  Keith Jarvis  82  deputy director of construction   There were no offers at all   no interest from anybody  At that point we went through the normal process to get permits in place to demolish it  The house is the first of two structures slated for demolition at the construction site  The second  a concrete block structure at 309 N  Main St  formerly used as VMI s wellness center  will be torn down later this month  Materials salvaged from the houses will be recycled under guidelines that qualify the new training facility for LEED certification   The brick chimney  the fieldstone foundation  and the tin roof were the components that were worth segregating and recycling  said Jarvis of the Hall Poindexter House   309 N  Main  is almost all block  so that will be able to be   recycled  A third structure  the Knights of Pythias building  is being moved to VMI property on the edge of the construction site  The building is being preserved because of its historic connection with the African American community in Lexington  The 350 ton structure has been raised from its foundations and will be moved along Main Street during the fall semester to new foundations being prepared adjacent to Ballard and Parker Service Center  Before that happens  the overhead utilities along Main Street  for which crews are currently installing conduit  will be buried  That effort has an estimated completion date of mid September    John Robertson IV  VMI Communications   Marketing News and Features Construction News Institute Report Photos   Videos Cindy

IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  5  2014   The Hall Poindexter House was demolished this morning in preparation for the construction of the New Indoor Training Facility at the intersection of Diamond and Main streets  Phase I of VMI s Corps Physical Training Facilities project  expected to be completed in July 2016  The house was constructed in 1877 as part of a group of six similar houses known as Preston Row  It has not been used as a residence since the 1970s and most recently housed a first floor barbershop before its sale to VMI in 2005  The structure was once a part of the historic Diamond Hill neighborhood  and likely housed members of Lexington s African American community from its construction and through much of the 1900s  Before planning to demolish the house  VMI s construction office made efforts to find a party willing to acquire and relocate it   We offered the Hall Poindexter House up for sale to anyone who wanted to relocate it  and they had to present a plan on how and where they were going to move it  said Col  Keith Jarvis  82  deputy director of construction   There were no offers at all   no interest from anybody  At that point we went through the normal process to get permits in place to demolish it  The house is the first of two structures slated for demolition at the construction site  The second  a concrete block structure at 309 N  Main St  formerly used as VMI s wellness center  will be torn down later this month  Materials salvaged from the houses will be recycled under guidelines that qualify the new training facility for LEED certification   The brick chimney  the fieldstone foundation  and the tin roof were the components that were worth segregating and recycling  said Jarvis of the Hall Poindexter House   309 N  Main  is almost all block  so that will be able to be   recycled  A third structure  the Knights of Pythias building  is being moved to VMI property on the edge of the construction site  The building is being preserved because of its historic connection with the African American community in Lexington  The 350 ton structure has been raised from its foundations and will be moved along Main Street during the fall semester to new foundations being prepared adjacent to Ballard and Parker Service Center  Before that happens  the overhead utilities along Main Street  for which crews are currently installing conduit  will be buried  That effort has an estimated completion date of mid September    John Robertson IV  VMI      House Razed to Make Way for Training Facility The Hall Poindexter House is demolished to make way
