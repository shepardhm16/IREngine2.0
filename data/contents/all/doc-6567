of Study   Engineering   ECE   Robot Sorter Project Navigation the Biggest Challenge in Robot Sorter Project A group of eight electrical engineering majors is gearing up for a robotics competition with a machine so skilled it seems to have sprung from the realm of science fiction  The cadets  all in their 1st Class year  are enrolled in Col  Dan Barr  74 s systems validation course  which serves as the capstone course for electrical engineering majors  The group has designed and built  and is now fine tuning  a cat sized robot that can sort blocks by color and size while operating on a flat black surface slightly larger than a pool table  The work of the autonomous logistics robot is meant to simulate activity at a port  where cargo is sorted and then loaded for shipment by rail  sea  or air  The group  which goes by the team name  Blockwork Orange  will compete against 50 to 60 teams from other colleges and universities at the I EEE SoutheastCon Hardware Competition  to be held April 5 7 in Jacksonville  Fla  Barr has seen VMI teams consistently place in the top quarter at this competition ever since he took over teaching the class in 2008  The old saying that Rome wasn t built in a day might apply to robots as well  Work on the capstone course s requirements actually begins during the second semester of the cadets  2nd Class year  In that semester  the future engineers enroll in Systems Design No  1  which involves the study of concepts and functions  It s a class that involves more thinking than doing   They start thinking about it  not touching it  said Barr   They might order some parts over the summer  In the first semester of their 1st Class year  the cadets enroll in Systems Design No  2  which involves building the robot and the tabletop area in which it will operate  plus writing software that will be used to control the robot  The class in which the cadets are now enrolled  Systems Validation  involves testing and fine tuning their creation  with the goal of a successful run at the April competition foremost in everyone s mind  And while the capstone course is heavy on technical skills  the cadets have found that they learn just as much about teamwork as they do about debugging hardware and software   The biggest thing I learned from this was dividing and conquering  said Cadet Carl Bird  who serves as technical lead on the project   We have such a great group of gifted people  Properly positioning those people so they can excel and use those skills was definitely the biggest thing  It s just this lesson that the capstone course and the two preceding it are designed to teach  said Barr   This sequence of courses  prepares the cadets for engineering careers where teamwork on projects having complex requirements is key  he said  That teamwork is still very much ongoing as the cadets work to fine tune their creation  So far  members of Blockwork Orange have found that while it s relatively simple to get a robot to sort blocks by color   a feat that s accomplished by the machine s four LED color sensors  which pick up light frequencies   getting it to move in precisely the right direction at the right moment is much more challenging   The hardest part has been navigation  by far  said Bird   It s a level playing field  and there s nothing physical for the robot to base itself off of  When you re picking up something small like  a block  distance matters a lot  Cadet Stuart Hughes  who serves as project manager  agreed that getting the navigation working smoothly is a must  because in the actual competition  entrants aren t allowed to touch their creations during each robot s five minute run  To refine the robot s ability to find the blocks  the cadets are planning to add a gyroscope  Despite the hiccups remaining  though  Hughes is excited about the upcoming competition   There s some pretty strong schools in the mix  so it ll be pretty cool to see how we match up  he noted    Mary Price  VMI  VMI

Biggest Challenge in Robot Sorter Project A group of eight electrical engineering majors is gearing up for a robotics competition with a machine so skilled it seems to have sprung from the realm of science fiction  The cadets  all in their 1st Class year  are enrolled in Col  Dan Barr  74 s systems validation course  which serves as the capstone course for electrical engineering majors  The group has designed and built  and is now fine tuning  a cat sized robot that can sort blocks by color and size while operating on a flat black surface slightly larger than a pool table  The work of the autonomous logistics robot is meant to simulate activity at a port  where cargo is sorted and then loaded for shipment by rail  sea  or air  The group  which goes by the team name  Blockwork Orange  will compete against 50 to 60 teams from other colleges and universities at the I EEE SoutheastCon Hardware Competition  to be held April 5 7 in Jacksonville  Fla  Barr has seen VMI teams consistently place in the top quarter at this competition ever since he took over teaching the class in 2008  The old saying that Rome wasn t built in a day might apply to robots as well  Work on the capstone course s requirements actually begins during the second semester of the cadets  2nd Class year  In that semester  the future engineers enroll in Systems Design No  1  which involves the study of concepts and functions  It s a class that involves more thinking than doing   They start thinking about it  not touching it  said Barr   They might order some parts over the summer  In the first semester of their 1st Class year  the cadets enroll in Systems Design No  2  which involves building the robot and the tabletop area in which it will operate  plus writing software that will be used to control the robot  The class in which the cadets are now enrolled  Systems Validation  involves testing and fine tuning their creation  with the goal of a successful run at the April competition foremost in everyone s mind  And while the capstone course is heavy on technical skills  the cadets have found that they learn just as much about teamwork as they do about debugging hardware and software   The biggest thing I learned from this was dividing and conquering  said Cadet Carl Bird  who serves as technical lead on the project   We have such a great group of gifted people  Properly positioning those people so they can excel and use those skills was definitely the biggest thing  It s just this lesson that the capstone course and the two preceding it are designed to teach  said Barr   This sequence of courses  prepares the cadets for engineering careers where teamwork on projects having complex requirements is key  he said  That teamwork is still very much ongoing as the cadets work to fine tune their creation  So far  members of Blockwork Orange have found that while it s relatively simple to get a robot to sort blocks by color   a feat that s accomplished by the machine s four LED color sensors  which pick up light frequencies   getting it to move in precisely the right direction at the right moment is much more challenging   The hardest part has been navigation  by far  said Bird   It s a level playing field  and there s nothing physical for the robot to base itself off of  When you re picking up something small like  a block  distance matters a lot  Cadet Stuart Hughes  who serves as project manager  agreed that getting the navigation working smoothly is a must  because in the actual competition  entrants aren t allowed to touch their creations during each robot s five minute run  To refine the robot s ability to find the blocks  the cadets are planning to add a gyroscope  Despite the hiccups remaining  though  Hughes is excited about the upcoming competition   There s some pretty strong schools in the mix  so it ll be pretty cool to see how we match up  he noted    Mary Price  VMI Engineering Division ECE Home Degrees
