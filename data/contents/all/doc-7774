majors traveled to Richmond to tour the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank and to talk with Ray Owens  an economist working for the Fed  The trip was part of Col  Gutermuth s Money and Banking course  which covers the Federal Reserve System in detail  This was the second trip VMI has made to the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank  ODE and SBD made a similar trip in the fall  Since 9 11  security has been very tight at the Fed  so only certain areas were available for viewing  The law enforcement center there watches every area of the bank with cameras feeding live video in the main control center  Security guards are everywhere  and accompanied us for part of the tour  Interestingly  these security officers are similar to federal agents in that they can be sent to any one of the 12 district banks across the country  or their branches  and have the same authority regardless of location  The Richmond Fed actually sent some of its officers to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to maintain security there  One of the most interesting areas in the bank was the  cash area  where millions and millions of dollars pass through every day  Bills are checked for rips  writing  tape  and level of cleanliness and pulled from circulation if not  up to snuff  They are counted  bundled  and sent either to the massive vault deep within the bowels of the bank  or sent off to commercial institutions via armored cars  We were allowed into the board room and sat around the horseshoe shaped table just as the directors might do during one of their meetings   Cadet Fredericks sat in the president s chair  and several cadets almost tipped over backwards in the cushy seats  We learned how the meetings are conducted and what types of people serve as directors of the district bank  Amanda Gibson  one of the tour guides  explained that employees of the Fed are NOT federal government employees  But they do enjoy lots of benefits  including a dining area overlooking the city and the James River  Employees also have access to a superb work out center  where they can take a break during the day to exercise  They even have a health center to provide basic medical care during working hours  A great place to work for anyone looking to change jobs  The actual tour of the Fed lasted an hour  The group then met with Dr  Owens who explained what the Fed does and its changing philosophy about what policies the Fed should follow   Having worked for the Fed for over 20 years  he explained how  over time  the Fed has had to adjust to the ever changing forces affecting our economy  I was personally surprised to learn that the Fed no longer targets monetary aggregates  M1  M2  etc  due the difficulties in measuring  money  Rather  the Fed targets interest rates without necessarily worrying about the actual supply of money  He explained it as  only worrying about the vertical axis and disregarding the horizontal axis  Some of you econ majors will know what this means  So  while detailed maps and directions were provided to the cadets  and yet some still ended up on the other end of Richmond for a while  everyone arrived safely  had a fun and informative tour  and then  most  headed off for an extended weekend  spent studying  I m sure  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families
