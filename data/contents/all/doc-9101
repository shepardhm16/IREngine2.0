Undergraduate Research Home Teaching Research Advising Personal Students have produced an extraordinary variety of quality work in various independent research projects  Like any engineering project  much of the work lies in the documentation  and I require cadets to provide an oral presentation and submit a written project report and a web page for every project undertaken  The following pages show a sampling of the research work of some of the students I have advised  These are truly some of the finest men and women with whom I have had the pleasure of collaboration    Tick Rover Gen III Nathan Howard  Stuart Hughes  and John Ruhl   13 We are building the third generation of the Tick Rover with the generous aid of the VMI Foundation  The model has been improved from Generation II in many ways including improved velocity sensing  higher torque motors  response to being flipped over  anti fouling axials  and computer regulation of the base station  The student team won second place in the URS undergraduate research conference for engineering  After testing in in early June by the Old Dominion University team of Drs  Dan Sonenshine and Holly Gaff it was featured in a number of newspaper articles and television reports  click here and expand the Popular Media Television section  Tick Rover Gen II Tommy Kendzia and Ben Absher   12 In 2012 Tommy Kendzia and Washington and Lee student Ben Absher constructed an improved version of the first generation tick rover originally tested in 2006  This second generation robot was designed to be rugged enough to withstand independent laboratory testing for two weeks at Fordham University  The robot was demonstrated at the Virginia Academy of Science and the MARCUS undergraduate research conference at Sweet Briar  link Sniper Fire Identification Timothy Graziano   09 This device identifies the sonic signature of a gunshot using digital signal processing  and measures the audible strength of the sound on an LED  The intent was to synthesize a network of three of these to provide a wearable device that could immediately triangule the position of sniper fire in an urban battlefield situation  Tim earned second place in the VMI Undergraduate Reseach Symposium in engineering for the device  and presented at BigSURS 2010 at Radford College  link Seismic Communication Will Flathers   07 The Seismic Communicator uses seismic waves to allow miners trapped in an underground mine collapse to inform rescue teams of their positions and vital statistics  Tested to more than 200  in the Natural Bridge Caverns  this project was a feature segment on Discovery Channel Canada  won first place in the IEEE sectional paper competition  and is patented and licensed  link Endovascular Stents Raevon Pulliam and Lisa Martinez  07 Washington   Lee premed student Lisa Martinez teamed with VMI mechanical engineers Raevon Pulliam and Ted Davis to investigate a novel endovascular stent weave pattern inspired by ancient Celtic knots  Their work was featured on local TV WSLS and published presented at the 2008 National Council of Undergraduate Research  link Hearing Impairment Simulator G  Will Flathers  07 The Hearing Impairment Simulator allows parents of hearing disabled children to hear as their children hear  Parents enter their child s audiology chart and record their own voice or a pre recorded sound for processing  The project is co advised by Roger Ruth  M D  president of the American Academy of Audiology  won second place among engineering posters at the VMI URS 2006 and was featured on Channel 10 News  Roanoke  WSLS  link Tick Collecting Robot Justin Woulfe  Barry Hammond  and Dennis Crump  05 The Autonomous Tick Rover collects and exterminates ticks while traversing an area  The robot follows a chemoattractant tube that attracts ticks to the robot s path  It won first place in the VMS Section s 2005 IEEE student paper s contest and a Wetmore Research Grant  Patent rights were filed in 2006 naming the cadets and their advisors as the primary inventors  link Internet Aware Medical Refrigerator Matthew York  04  Paul Kuwick  05  Tom Largi  05  and Dennis Crump  06 The Internet Aware Medical Refrigerator monitors how frequently a patient takes a medication  e g  insulin  as shown during field testing by a diabetic patient  If an unexplained delay is detected it sends a warning email to the patient s family and doctor  It won first place in engineering in the 2004 VMI Undergraduate Research Symposium  link Museum of Science Optical Multiplexer Demo Paul Kuwik and Tom Largi  05 Kuwik and Largi designed this demonstration to show how multiple different signals can be combined onto a single communications line  such as on a computer network or telephone wire  Combining optics  microprocessors  and analog control circuitry it was displayed in the 2003 VMI URS Symposium and earned a Wetmore Research Grant  link Museum of Science Optical Multiplexer Demo Paul Kuwik and Tom Largi  05 The Computerized Parking Garage routes cars in a crowded garage to an optimal parking space  The system combines electrical and computer engineering and mathematics in an algorithm and internet based hardware to provide a solution to this difficult problem  Students have a patent on the technology and are seeking licensure  It won first place in engineering in the 2003 VMI Undergraduate Research Symposium  link Smart Catheter Matt Brooks and Steve Lee  02 The Smart Catheter Project involved constructing biomedical catheters with integrated sensors and the hardware and software necessary to display the results on a laptop computer  The work was funded by a grant from MIT and resulted in first place sectional and regional 2002 IEEE Student Paper Competition awards  one of seven such awards in the country  a Hinman Research Award  and an honors thesis for Brooks  link Museum of Science Laser Communication Display Matt Brooks  02 and Brian Holt  05 Brooks  Holt  and the ECE class of 2001 designed this demonstration of laser based communication systems for the Science Museum of Western Virginia  It won third place in the 2002 VMI Undergraduate Research Symposium  link
