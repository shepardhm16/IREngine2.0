the diplomatic agenda    Photo courtesy of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2011   A discussion on the ways that the United States and China are cooperating and competing in Africa took place on Nov  4  during the sixth panel discussion of  The Eagle and The Dragon in Africa  conference  On the panel were J  Peter Pham  director of the Michael S  Ansari Africa Center at the Atlantic Council  and David Shinn  adjunct professor at the Elliot School of International Affairs at George Washington University  It was chaired by Col  Jim Hentz  professor of international studies at Virginia Military Institute  Shinn noted the range of common goals that the United States and China have in Africa  Both nations encourage economic development  promote stability in government  and seek to defeat terrorist organizations   If the United States  and China s interests in China overlap  then there can be collaboration  said Shinn  Shinn went on to enumerate areas in which there is room for collaboration between the United States and China  including United Nations peacekeeping missions  promoting health initiatives  and supporting agricultural development  Despite the opportunities and shared interests  Shinn noted that influence in Africa is shifting in China s favor   The West  due in large part to budgetary constraints  is either holding steady or even scaling back in Africa  while China and some other countries continue to press forward on all fronts  said Shinn   Chinese influence grows  while Western influence is static and  in some cases  even in decline  Recognizing the potential benefits to African nations of functioning relationships with the United States and with China  Pham noted that African nations should steer the development of those relationships   I would emphasize   the need for African agency  said Pham   It s not about just what America is doing for Africa or what China is doing  We have to engage Africans as actors  African governments  and civil society sectors within those  nations  and bring them into this dialogue  Pham warned of looking at China or the United States as monoliths  pointing out that the influence of both the China and the United States in Africa is a result of the sum of actions taken by government entities  businesses  and individuals  Hentz explained the difficulties that African nations have in leveraging their interests against the interests of the governments of China and the United States   In any bilateral relationship  the giant is going to win  said Hentz   It s almost impossible for an individual state in Africa to out negotiate the United States  China  or the EU  While African countries have more leverage when dealing with businesses  there are limits to the benefits businesses can provide  Pham used the example of how U S  oil extraction in Nigeria can t bring a microchip factory to Nigeria   Who is it exactly that wants to extract the oil from Nigeria  From the U S  side it s Exxon Mobil and Chevron  said Pham   Exxon Mobil and Chevron are  to the best of my knowledge  not in the microchip business  So  asking Exxon Mobil for a microchip factory doesn t quite work  The only undergraduate to present during the conference was Joseph Riley  a Jefferson Scholar at the University of Virginia  Deborah Brautigam  author of The Dragon s Gift  The Real Story of China in Africa  spoke alongside Riley in the seventh and final panel  which was chaired by Yoon Jung Park  senior research associate at Rhodes University   John Robertson IV  VMI    VMI
