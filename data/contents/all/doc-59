chemistry with a thorough foundation in chemistry  mastery of modern chemical instrumentation  excellent analytical and mathematical skills and the ability to think things through and solve problems  These skills are highly sought after in every career field  The department offers two degree tracks  the B S  degree and the B A  degree in chemistry  The B S  degree provides the most comprehensive preparation for further work or study in chemistry or a related field such as  Chemical Engineering Material Science Environmental Science Pharmacology The Chemistry Department s B S  degree is approved by the American Chemical Society and cadets fulfilling the requirements for a B S  are certified as having met the standards of professional training by the society  The B A  degree provides cadets with an opportunity to pursue other interests in preparation for a career of their choosing while providing a solid foundation in the basic areas of chemistry  This degree requires cadets to choose another focus area outside of chemistry and complete either a minor  concentration or certification  Faculty members will work closely with B A  majors to design a program that best meets the cadets  career goals  Career choices could correspond to the following focus areas  Medical  Dental Schools Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Military or Intelligence Agencies International Studies Minor  National Security Minor  Arabic Minor Law Enforcement or Forensics Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Business MBA Business or Economics Minor Math Science Teacher Teacher Certification Program Faculty members believe that close interaction with cadets in the classroom and in the chemical laboratory is critical in the development of good chemistry majors  This personal mentoring occurs in many ways but especially in our small classes and during undergraduate research projects  All majors are encouraged to participate in an undergraduate research experience under the guidance of a faculty member either in a 10 week summer program  or during the academic year  The majority of chemistry majors participate in at least one undergraduate research experience  Most of these cadets will present their research at a local or regional professional meeting  and a smaller number will have their results published  Chemistry majors also have the opportunity to work as an industrial intern with a company during the summer  Majors who have demonstrated excellence in the study of chemistry are invited to participate in the departmental honors program during their first class year  Cadets who accept the invitation will be engaged in more extensive research under the close supervision of a faculty sponsor  The laboratory facilities and instrumentation housed in Maury Brooke Hall provide majors with the modern techniques needed to learn and practice the science of chemistry both in structured courses and labs and also in independent research  Instrumentation includes liquid and gas chromatographs  several infrared  visible  ultraviolet  and fluorescence spectrometers  a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer  a single crystal X ray diffractometer  a differential scanning calorimeter a microwave reactor  a dual potentiostat with rotating ring disc electrode  and atomic absorption and flame emission spectrometers  The department also maintains a computer facility for molecular modeling and chemistry tutorials  Programs Chemistry  B A  Chemistry  B S  Courses CHEMISTRY Department of Chemistry

thorough foundation in chemistry  mastery of modern chemical instrumentation  excellent analytical and mathematical skills and the ability to think things through and solve problems  These skills are highly sought after in every career field  The department offers two degree tracks  the B S  degree and the B A  degree in chemistry  The B S  degree provides the most comprehensive preparation for further work or study in chemistry or a related field such as  Chemical Engineering Material Science Environmental Science Pharmacology The Chemistry Department s B S  degree is approved by the American Chemical Society and cadets fulfilling the requirements for a B S  are certified as having met the standards of professional training by the society  The B A  degree provides cadets with an opportunity to pursue other interests in preparation for a career of their choosing while providing a solid foundation in the basic areas of chemistry  This degree requires cadets to choose another focus area outside of chemistry and complete either a minor  concentration or certification  Faculty members will work closely with B A  majors to design a program that best meets the cadets  career goals  Career choices could correspond to the following focus areas  Medical  Dental Schools Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Military or Intelligence Agencies International Studies Minor  National Security Minor  Arabic Minor Law Enforcement or Forensics Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Business MBA Business or Economics Minor Math Science Teacher Teacher Certification Program Faculty members believe that close interaction with cadets in the classroom and in the chemical laboratory is critical in the development of good chemistry majors  This personal mentoring occurs in many ways but especially in our small classes and during undergraduate research projects  All majors are encouraged to participate in an undergraduate research experience under the guidance of a faculty member either in a 10 week summer program  or during the academic year  The majority of chemistry majors participate in at least one undergraduate research experience  Most of these cadets will present their research at a local or regional professional meeting  and a smaller number will have their results published  Chemistry majors also have the opportunity to work as an industrial intern with a company during the summer  Majors who have demonstrated excellence in the study of chemistry are invited to participate in the departmental honors program during their first class year  Cadets who accept the invitation will be engaged in more extensive research under the close supervision of a faculty sponsor  The laboratory facilities and instrumentation housed in Maury Brooke Hall provide majors with the modern techniques needed to learn and practice the science of chemistry both in structured courses and labs and also in independent research  Instrumentation includes liquid and gas chromatographs  several infrared  visible  ultraviolet  and fluorescence spectrometers  a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer  a single crystal X ray diffractometer  a differential scanning calorimeter a microwave reactor  a dual potentiostat with rotating ring disc electrode  and atomic absorption and flame emission spectrometers  The department also maintains a

department is to provide cadets who major in chemistry with a thorough foundation in chemistry  mastery of modern chemical instrumentation  excellent analytical and mathematical skills and the ability to think things through and solve problems  These skills are highly sought after in every career field  The department offers two degree tracks  the B S  degree and the B A  degree in chemistry  The B S  degree provides the most comprehensive preparation for further work or study in chemistry or a related field such as  Chemical Engineering Material Science Environmental Science Pharmacology The Chemistry Department s B S  degree is approved by the American Chemical Society and cadets fulfilling the requirements for a B S  are certified as having met the standards of professional training by the society  The B A  degree provides cadets with an opportunity to pursue other interests in preparation for a career of their choosing while providing a solid foundation in the basic areas of chemistry  This degree requires cadets to choose another focus area outside of chemistry and complete either a minor  concentration or certification  Faculty members will work closely with B A  majors to design a program that best meets the cadets  career goals  Career choices could correspond to the following focus areas  Medical  Dental Schools Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Military or Intelligence Agencies International Studies Minor  National Security Minor  Arabic Minor Law Enforcement or Forensics Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Business MBA Business or Economics Minor Math Science Teacher Teacher Certification Program Faculty members believe that close interaction with cadets in the classroom and in the chemical laboratory is critical in the development of good chemistry majors  This personal mentoring occurs in many ways but especially in our small classes and during undergraduate research projects  All majors are encouraged to participate in an undergraduate research experience under the guidance of a faculty member either in a 10 week summer program  or during the academic year  The majority of chemistry majors participate in at least one undergraduate research experience  Most of these cadets will present their research at a local or regional professional meeting  and a smaller number will have their results published  Chemistry majors also have the opportunity to work as an industrial intern with a company during the summer  Majors who have demonstrated excellence in the study of chemistry are invited to participate in the departmental honors program during their first class year  Cadets who accept the invitation will be engaged in more extensive research under the close supervision of a faculty sponsor  The laboratory facilities and instrumentation housed in Maury Brooke Hall provide majors with the modern techniques needed to learn and practice the science of chemistry both in structured courses and labs and also in independent research  Instrumentation includes liquid and gas chromatographs  several infrared  visible  ultraviolet  and fluorescence spectrometers  a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer  a single crystal X ray diffractometer  a differential scanning calorimeter a microwave reactor  a dual potentiostat with rotating ring disc electrode  and atomic absorption and flame emission spectrometers  The department also maintains a computer facility for molecular modeling and chemistry tutorials  Programs Chemistry  B A  Chemistry  B S  Courses CHEMISTRY Department of

who major in chemistry with a thorough foundation in chemistry  mastery of modern chemical instrumentation  excellent analytical and mathematical skills and the ability to think things through and solve problems  These skills are highly sought after in every career field  The department offers two degree tracks  the B S  degree and the B A  degree in chemistry  The B S  degree provides the most comprehensive preparation for further work or study in chemistry or a related field such as  Chemical Engineering Material Science Environmental Science Pharmacology The Chemistry Department s B S  degree is approved by the American Chemical Society and cadets fulfilling the requirements for a B S  are certified as having met the standards of professional training by the society  The B A  degree provides cadets with an opportunity to pursue other interests in preparation for a career of their choosing while providing a solid foundation in the basic areas of chemistry  This degree requires cadets to choose another focus area outside of chemistry and complete either a minor  concentration or certification  Faculty members will work closely with B A  majors to design a program that best meets the cadets  career goals  Career choices could correspond to the following focus areas  Medical  Dental Schools Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Military or Intelligence Agencies International Studies Minor  National Security Minor  Arabic Minor Law Enforcement or Forensics Concentration in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Business MBA Business or Economics Minor Math Science Teacher Teacher Certification Program Faculty members believe that close interaction with cadets in the classroom and in the chemical laboratory is critical in the development of good chemistry majors  This personal mentoring occurs in many ways but especially in our small classes and during undergraduate research projects  All majors are encouraged to participate in an undergraduate research experience under the guidance of a faculty member either in a 10 week summer program  or during the academic year  The majority of chemistry majors participate in at least one undergraduate research experience  Most of these cadets will present their research at a local or regional professional meeting  and a smaller number will have their results published  Chemistry majors also have the opportunity to work as an industrial intern with a company during the summer  Majors who have demonstrated excellence in the study of chemistry are invited to participate in the departmental honors program during their first class year  Cadets who accept the invitation will be engaged in more extensive research under the close supervision of a faculty sponsor  The laboratory facilities and instrumentation housed in Maury Brooke Hall provide majors with the modern techniques needed to learn and practice the science of chemistry both in structured courses and labs and also in independent research  Instrumentation includes liquid and gas chromatographs  several infrared  visible  ultraviolet  and fluorescence spectrometers  a nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometer  a single crystal X ray diffractometer  a differential scanning calorimeter a microwave reactor  a dual potentiostat with rotating ring disc electrode  and atomic absorption and flame emission spectrometers  The department also maintains a computer facility for molecular modeling and chemistry tutorials  Programs Chemistry  B A  Chemistry  B S  Courses CHEMISTRY Department of Chemistry
