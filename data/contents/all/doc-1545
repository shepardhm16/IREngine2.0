interested academia  and individuals interested in implementing sustainable stormwater solutions for new or existing properties  Workshop Description Workshop A  1 00 p m    3 15 p m  Rainwater Harvesting Systems  Design  Implementation and Potential Instructors  David Crawford  Sarah Lawson  Benjamin Sojka  The goal of this workshop is to increase knowledge and awareness about potential benefits of rainwater harvesting systems and introduce workshop participants to the design concept and implementation of modern rainwater harvesting systems      A rainwater harvesting system  RWH  is defined as rooftop rainwater capture and various uses  indoor and outdoor  of captured rainwater  A modern rainwater harvesting system is considered a decentralized water infrastructure which provides a significant opportunity for sustainable management of water resources  particularly in urban settings where building rooftops constitute 40  or more of impervious areas  There is much interest in water reuse to increase sustainability of water supplies  It s ideal to manage water storage within a RWH system in order to increase stormwater runoff reduction benefits  The content for this workshop will describes and describe the following topics  Rainwater harvesting system technology  rainwater capture  filtering  tank storage  plumbing   codes  cost and maintenance Rainwater harvesting system design Rainwater harvesting case studies for stormwater runoff control  potable water saving and energy conservation Challenges facing implementation of rainwater harvesting systems Workshop A Participants  Takeaway Understanding the importance of rainwater systems as component of integrated and sustainable water resources management in urban and sub urban environments Learning about the technology of modern rainwater harvesting systems  codes and regulations An understanding of how rainwater harvesting systems work  and their key design variables  An understanding of the main cost drivers of rainwater harvesting systems and how to assess benefits Coffee Break  3 15 p m    3 30 p m  Workshop B  3 30 p m    4 45 p m  Porous Pavement  The Triple Bottom Line   Practical Implementation Instructors  Steve Sunderman and Thomas E  Sproul The goal of this workshop is to increase knowledge and awareness about potential benefits of Porous paving as a stormwater management strategy and as a means to comply with new environmental mandates  To comply with new environmental mandates  many local jurisdictions are encouraging low impact development and imposing stormwater utility fees for impervious surface areas of properties  Porous paving systems are widely recognized as an extremely effective LID stormwater BMP   This workshop will address the following questions  Describes how porous paving is a sustainable  Triple Bottom Line  strategy for low impact development Explains best engineering strategies for designing porous paving as an extremely effective BMP Illustrates examples of practical implementation of porous paving BMP s  How can porous paving  as a BMP  minimize initial and long term costs for all stakeholders  How can porous paving achieve the intent of stormwater quantity   quality control regulations  What hurdles hinder implementation of porous paving as a full BMP and how can we overcome hurdles  Workshop B Participants  Takeaway Recognize porous paving as a sustainable LID strategy that achieves the Triple Bottom Line  socially  economically and environmentally How to design   implement porous paving as a practical stormwater BMP sign   implement porous paving as a practical stormwater BMP Recognize innovative   effective porous paving examples How comply with intent of Virginia s quantity and quality control regulations How to minimize life cycle costs  including stormwater utility fees  Wrap Up Discussion   Q A  4 45 p m    5 00 p m  Instructors  Background   Experience Workshop  Innovations in Stormwater Management
