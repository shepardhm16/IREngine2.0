give vmiaa org   Investments at VMI FAQs Why are all endowments that in some way support VMI managed by one body  To ensure the most cost efficient operations and effective investment management possible  all endowments that support VMI as well as the George C  Marshall Foundation are managed together and have been for many years  First performed by the VMI Investment Committee  this work has been carried out by VMI Investment Holdings LLC since 2009  Why did VMI Investment Holdings LLC come into being  In 2009  after enduring a decade and a half in which two  bubbles  burst  the leaders of the VMI Alumni Agencies  the Institute  and the George C  Marshall Foundation decided that more dynamic management was needed for what can best be called the VMI Endowment  Does VMI Investment Holdings LLC directly manage the endowment  No  In 2009  it was decided to hire an independent investment firm to manage it  After an extensive search and a lengthy evaluation process  Cliffwater LLC  a nationally recognized firm that specializes in aiding institutional investors  was chosen for the task  Of course  such a management choice in no way relieves VMI Investment Holdings LLC of its fiduciary responsibilities  What is the involvement of VMI Investment Holdings LLC in the management process  Cliffwater LLC routinely reports to VMI Investment Holdings LLC  and there are quarterly meetings in which members of the VMI Investment Holdings LLC meet face to face with Cliffwater representatives  What is the overall investment approach  Before 2009  investments that supported VMI were weighted heavily toward equities and bonds  While this meant impressive gains when  say  the stock market was booming  it translated into serious losses when the bottom dropped out of the equities market  The current overall policy goal is to protect against major downturns  The new allocation entails more fixed income and fixed income associated investments as well as what are termed  defensive alternative investments  Recently  it was decided to allocate some funds to private equity investments  What has the endowment s recent performance been  At the end of Fiscal Year 2014  the market value of the VMI Endowment was  371 1 million  Using the Fiscal Year 2009 market value of  234 7 million as a benchmark  this reflects an increase of  136 4 million or 58  But the stock market has been performing strongly over the past few years  Shouldn t that mean a return to bigger investments in equities  Admittedly  if the investment allocation were weighted more heavily toward equities  especially U S  equities  the performance of the endowment might be stronger at this particular time  However  the enduring health of the VMI Endowment is essential to the lasting success of the Institute  So  the current strategy is seen as the best way to generate more support for VMI as well as add value to the VMI Endowment in the long term  How much support does the endowment provide to the Institute  Since 2004  the VMI Endowment has provided more than  100 million in support to the Institute  It has done so in part because the distribution rate has been kept relatively high at 4 8   most institutional endowments  rate is 4  In those years  VMI s need for increased private support overcame the need to grow the endowment which also affected the growth rate in its market value  How can the endowment grow faster and keep providing increased support to VMI  First  by adhering to a sound  long term investment strategy that protects against market volatility as much as possible  Second  more growth in the endowment would allow VMI Investment Holdings LLC to reduce the distribution rate and return more funds to the endowment s corpus  Another way is by adding to the corpus through successful fundraising  In this regard  the trend in fundraising is positive  In Fiscal Year 2014  the VMI Family gave  34 2 million in gifts and commitments in support of the Institute  and many of these gifts and commitments are earmarked for new and existing endowments  Stewardship   Financial Statements Information Policies Investments at VMI Investments at VMI   FAQ VMI Foundation

for what can best be called the VMI Endowment  Does VMI Investment Holdings LLC directly manage the endowment  No  In 2009  it was decided to hire an independent investment firm to manage it  After an extensive search and a lengthy evaluation process  Cliffwater LLC  a nationally recognized firm that specializes in aiding institutional investors  was chosen for the task  Of course  such a management choice in no way relieves VMI Investment Holdings LLC of its fiduciary responsibilities  What is the involvement of VMI Investment Holdings LLC in the management process  Cliffwater LLC routinely reports to VMI Investment Holdings LLC  and there are quarterly meetings in which members of the VMI Investment Holdings LLC meet face to face with Cliffwater representatives  What is the overall investment approach  Before 2009  investments that supported VMI were weighted heavily toward equities and bonds  While this meant impressive gains when  say  the stock market was booming  it translated into serious losses when the bottom dropped out of the equities market  The current overall policy goal is to protect against major downturns  The new allocation entails more fixed income and fixed income associated investments as well as what are termed  defensive alternative investments  Recently  it was decided to allocate some funds to private equity investments  What has the endowment s recent performance been  At the end of Fiscal Year 2014  the market value of the VMI Endowment was  371 1 million  Using the Fiscal Year 2009 market value of  234 7 million as a benchmark  this reflects an increase of  136 4 million or 58  But the stock market has been performing strongly over the past few years  Shouldn t that mean a return to bigger investments in equities  Admittedly  if the investment allocation were weighted more heavily toward equities  especially U S  equities  the performance of the endowment might be stronger at this particular time  However  the enduring health of the VMI Endowment is essential to the lasting success of the Institute  So  the current strategy is seen as the best way to generate more support for VMI as well as add value to the VMI Endowment in the long term  How much support does the endowment provide to the Institute  Since 2004  the VMI Endowment has provided more than  100 million in support to the Institute  It has done so in part because the distribution rate has been kept relatively high at 4 8   most institutional endowments  rate is 4  In those years  VMI s need for increased private support overcame the need to grow the endowment which also affected the growth rate in its market value  How can the endowment grow faster and keep providing increased support to VMI  First  by adhering to a sound  long term investment strategy that protects against market volatility as much as possible  Second  more growth in the endowment would allow VMI Investment Holdings LLC to reduce the distribution rate and return more funds to the endowment s corpus  Another way is by adding to the corpus through successful fundraising  In this regard  the trend in fundraising is positive  In Fiscal Year 2014  the VMI Family gave  34 2 million in gifts and commitments in support of the Institute  and many of these gifts and commitments are earmarked for new and existing endowments  Stewardship   Financial Statements
