Study   Natural Science   Mathematics   Applied Mathematics   Seeing the Beauty of the Equations Seeing the Beauty of the Equations Cadets recently experienced a connection between art and math in an interdisciplinary project involving the construction of a fractal   A fractal is a geometric shape that repeats itself over and over on both smaller and larger scales  So if you zoomed in or zoomed out  the picture would look identical  Lt  Col  Meagan Herald  associate professor of applied mathematics  told cadets during a recent visit to a Language of Art class studying the presence of geometric shapes in artwork   Math  can be very beautiful  and if you cannot see it in the equations  maybe you can see it in the art  she observed   Fractals are used in video games  and  computer generated graphics    things that most people find entertaining and artistic  The class  taught by Maj  Julie Brown  assistant professor English  Rhetoric  and Humanistic Studies  learned the basic mathematical concepts behind the fractals they see in art  Herald also showed them how to construct a cube shaped fractal out of business cards  The fractals Brown s class made are part of a larger project combining fractals made by Herald s math classes and extending beyond  The project  MegaMenger  sponsored by Queen Mary University in London and MoMath   The National Museum of Mathematics   in New York  seeks to build a virtual Level 4 fractal  with schools sharing their Level 3 constructions through social media   We re trying to get a lot of people that aren t necessarily fond of math to participate just to see that math is not that bad  explained Herald   I have one cadet who finds  making fractals  extremely relaxing  She has been taking a lot of cards and working really diligently on it  Herald collected 50 000 cards in preparation for the project  The construction process begins with cubes  each made from six business cards  Once 20 of the cubes are made  they are combined to form a Level 1 fractal  This process takes about an hour  said Herald  Twenty of the Level 1 fractals make a Level 2  and 20 Level 2 fractals make a Level 3  The project s culminating event was a big build Oct  25 and 26  when cadets who d been building fractals outside class brought them to Preston Library for seven hour build sessions  combining their individual work into a Level 3 fractal that measured about 5 feet square  Back in Brown s Language in Art class  the cadets are relating their experience with fractals to geometric art from an earlier era   We re working on a period in art   1950s and 1960s   where it is abstract    You see artists like Donald Judd who are working with cubes  trying to remove any sign or vestige of the artist having done the work  explained Brown   Judd  would send out a set of parameters for his artwork to a manufacturing company and they made the art  So since we re thinking about forms of geometric abstraction this week I thought it would be good to have them come in and do some hands on experimentation with that  Brown hopes the experience with fractals will prompt cadets in her class to consider different forms of art outside the traditional realm   It breaks down the idea of the genius of the single artist because this is a collaborative project  but it s still art    so it challenges our assumptions about what counts  Brown explained  The cadets  efforts will be on display Nov  18 when middle school students visiting post for the AMC 8 math contest will have the opportunity to view the Level 3 fractal  The Level 4 fractal  alas  will exist only in the cybersphere  Though it s not a physically coherent structure  Herald noted  the whole wide world will make it complete  To see more photos  visit
