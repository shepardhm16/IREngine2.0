talks with moderator Col  David Gray today in Gillis Theater    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  2  2015   Former New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly addressed a wide battery of urban and national security concerns in a talk given to a standing room only audience at Virginia Military Institute earlier today  A 50 year veteran of public service  Kelly became police commissioner in 2002  just months after the Sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  and would go on to become the longest serving commissioner in the city s history  Under his leadership  violent crime in the nation s largest city fell by 40 percent  Kelly was invited to VMI by the H B  Johnson Jr  26 Distinguished Lecture Series  Members of the Leadership Book Program recently read his just published memoir  Vigilance  My Life Serving America and Protecting Its Empire City  Prior to his talk  Kelly discussed his life s work  and the book  during a breakfast gathering with members of the book club  Kelly s talk at the Institute took the form of a moderated question and answer session  with Col  Dave Gray  director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  serving as the moderator  In attendance were not only a large number of cadets and interested community members  but also a dozen or more police officers from surrounding jurisdictions  While wide ranging  the questions tended to focus on lessons Kelly had learned from his years not only at the NYPD  where he established the first counterterrorism bureau at any municipal police department  but also his years as a U S  Marine  which included time spent in combat during the Vietnam War  Asked about the leadership traits he d learned in the Marine Corps  Kelly talked about many of the qualities a leader should have  among them justice  decisiveness  dependability  tact  loyalty  and enthusiasm   Leaders are made  not born  observed Kelly   You learn basic tenets in the military  and you use them the rest of your life  Kelly recalled that as a company grade officer in Vietnam  he not only had the opportunity to put his leadership skills to the test  but also to learn lessons that would bear fruit down the road at the helm of a police force larger than the FBI  He noted that in many ways  a crime ridden area is little different from a combat zone  When Gray asked Kelly about leadership of one s peers  a vital skill for cadets at VMI  the former commissioner replied that going  back to basics  was the way to go   Treat people fairly  he commented   Praise in public  criticize in private  Kelly did draw a distinction between the military  in which commissioned officers start ahead of enlisted personnel  and police departments  in which everyone starts at the same level   You have to make people understand in a nice way that you re the boss  he said  Problem solving was another central focus of the discussion  Asked how he d lowered New York City s crime rate  which was once one of the highest in the country  Kelly talked about the need to simply have more manpower   which  in New York City s case  amounted to obtaining sufficient funding to hire 5 000 more officers  But those officers didn t just sit behind desks  or cruise around in patrol cars  Community policing  in which police officers work with community members to identify and solve problems  was key to Kelly s crime fighting strategy  At the same time  Kelly allowed that many people have a negative view of police and thus don t see them as potential allies   What you strive for is mutual respect  said Kelly  who is now president of the risk management services division for a commercial real estate company with an international presence   Mutual problem solving can build that respect  On a larger level  Kelly had to address the issue of terrorism head on during his tenure as police commissioner   We knew we had to do something different  in the wake of the terrorist attacks that stunned a nation and left more than 3 000 people dead  said Kelly  Kelly reached outside of the traditional system to hire individuals who didn t have a police background  including a former CIA director and a retired lieutenant general in the Marine Corps  In addition  Kelly s Real Time Crime Center included listening outposts in 11 foreign countries  with personnel specifically trained in counter terrorism operations  Kelly noted that as a result of these and other efforts  at least 16 terrorist plots have been foiled since Sept  11  2001  Efforts to fight crime are  of course  fraught with the delicate balance between police acting on a reasonable suspicion that an illegal act has been or will be committed and preserving the civil liberties of a suspect  Kelly was asked about New York City s policy of  stop  question  frisk  in which police officers stop individuals suspected of committing a crime  question them  and frisk them for weapons  Critics of the program have claimed that this procedure unfairly targets African Americans and other minorities  In his response  Kelly pointed out that the U S  Supreme Court sanctioned this policy in the 1968 case Terry v  Ohio   Stop  question and frisk  is a tool that has to be in the tool kit of every police officer  said Kelly  Furthermore  the former commissioner noted that statistics have borne out that the NYPD is not engaging in racial profiling  He stated that historically  69 percent of the violent crimes in New York City have been committed by African Americans  but only 53 percent of the stop  question  and frisk stops have targeted individuals of that race  Kelly also voiced support for the use of body cameras by police  saying that they can help deter violent crimes  Near the end of the interview  Kelly took a handful of questions from his audience  Cadet Charles Borinstein  17 asked about the difference between a leader who can make change happen and one who cannot  In his response  Kelly said of the Sept  11 attacks   Don t let a good crisis go to waste  He noted the difficulty of making change in a unionized organization such as the NYPD  but said this challenge was counterbalanced by a  very supportive  Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the obvious need to do things differently to prevent another terrorist attack   You have to make the people affected by the change see it in their self interest  Kelly noted  The next questioner  Cadet Trey Rose  16  asked Kelly to discuss the threat of cyber terrorism   what form it would likely take and how it could be prevented   Cyber  terrorism  is the elephant in the corner  replied Kelly  who mentioned that the nation s electrical grid is particularly vulnerable to a cyber attack  Kelly also noted that far too many individuals are leaving themselves open to cyber crime each day  as studies have shown that the most common passwords used in America is  123456  or simply  password  Just before the program concluded  Gray asked Kelly if the former commissioner had any advice for cadets planning a career in either law enforcement or the military  Describing a career in those fields as  an immediate opportunity to do good  and  a great way to make a living  Kelly counseled   If you re at all inclined in that area  go ahead and give it a shot    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title

Commissioner Discusses Urban and National Security Ray Kelly talks with moderator Col  David Gray today in Gillis Theater    VMI Photo by H  Lockwood McLaughlin  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  2  2015   Former New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly addressed a wide battery of urban and national security concerns in a talk given to a standing room only audience at Virginia Military Institute earlier today  A 50 year veteran of public service  Kelly became police commissioner in 2002  just months after the Sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  and would go on to become the longest serving commissioner in the city s history  Under his leadership  violent crime in the nation s largest city fell by 40 percent  Kelly was invited to VMI by the H B  Johnson Jr  26 Distinguished Lecture Series  Members of the Leadership Book Program recently read his just published memoir  Vigilance  My Life Serving America and Protecting Its Empire City  Prior to his talk  Kelly discussed his life s work  and the book  during a breakfast gathering with members of the book club  Kelly s talk at the Institute took the form of a moderated question and answer session  with Col  Dave Gray  director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  serving as the moderator  In attendance were not only a large number of cadets and interested community members  but also a dozen or more police officers from surrounding jurisdictions  While wide ranging  the questions tended to focus on lessons Kelly had learned from his years not only at the NYPD  where he established the first counterterrorism bureau at any municipal police department  but also his years as a U S  Marine  which included time spent in combat during the Vietnam War  Asked about the leadership traits he d learned in the Marine Corps  Kelly talked about many of the qualities a leader should have  among them justice  decisiveness  dependability  tact  loyalty  and enthusiasm   Leaders are made  not born  observed Kelly   You learn basic tenets in the military  and you use them the rest of your life  Kelly recalled that as a company grade officer in Vietnam  he not only had the opportunity to put his leadership skills to the test  but also to learn lessons that would bear fruit down the road at the helm of a police force larger than the FBI  He noted that in many ways  a crime ridden area is little different from a combat zone  When Gray asked Kelly about leadership of one s peers  a vital skill for cadets at VMI  the former commissioner replied that going  back to basics  was the way to go   Treat people fairly  he commented   Praise in public  criticize in private  Kelly did draw a distinction between the military  in which commissioned officers start ahead of enlisted personnel  and police departments  in which everyone starts at the same level   You have to make people understand in a nice way that you re the boss  he said  Problem solving was another central focus of the discussion  Asked how he d lowered New York City s crime rate  which was once one of the highest in the country  Kelly talked about the need to simply have more manpower   which  in New York City s case  amounted to obtaining sufficient funding to hire 5 000 more officers  But those officers didn t just sit behind desks  or cruise around in patrol cars  Community policing  in which police officers work with community members to identify and solve problems  was key to Kelly s crime fighting strategy  At the same time  Kelly allowed that many people have a negative view of police and thus don t see them as potential allies   What you strive for is mutual respect  said Kelly  who is now president of the risk management services division for a commercial real estate company with an international presence   Mutual problem solving can build that respect  On a larger level  Kelly had to address the issue of terrorism head on during his tenure as police commissioner   We knew we had to do something different  in the wake of the terrorist attacks that stunned a nation and left more than 3 000 people dead  said Kelly  Kelly reached outside of the traditional system to hire individuals who didn t have a police background  including a former CIA director and a retired lieutenant general in the Marine Corps  In addition  Kelly s Real Time Crime Center included listening outposts in 11 foreign countries  with personnel specifically trained in counter terrorism operations  Kelly noted that as a result of these and other efforts  at least 16 terrorist plots have been foiled since Sept  11  2001  Efforts to fight crime are  of course  fraught with the delicate balance between police acting on a reasonable suspicion that an illegal act has been or will be committed and preserving the civil liberties of a suspect  Kelly was asked about New York City s policy of  stop  question  frisk  in which police officers stop individuals suspected of committing a crime  question them  and frisk them for weapons  Critics of the program have claimed that this procedure unfairly targets African Americans and other minorities  In his response  Kelly pointed out that the U S  Supreme Court sanctioned this policy in the 1968 case Terry v  Ohio   Stop  question and frisk  is a tool that has to be in the tool kit of every police officer  said Kelly  Furthermore  the former commissioner noted that statistics have borne out that the NYPD is not engaging in racial profiling  He stated that historically  69 percent of the violent crimes in New York City have been committed by African Americans  but only 53 percent of the stop  question  and frisk stops have targeted individuals of that race  Kelly also voiced support for the use of body cameras by police  saying that they can help deter violent crimes  Near the end of the interview  Kelly took a handful of questions from his audience  Cadet Charles Borinstein  17 asked about the difference between a leader who can make change happen and one who cannot  In his response  Kelly said of the Sept  11 attacks   Don t let a good crisis go to waste  He noted the difficulty of making change in a unionized organization such as the NYPD  but said this challenge was counterbalanced by a  very supportive  Mayor Michael Bloomberg and the obvious need to do things differently to prevent another terrorist attack   You have to make the people affected by the change see it in their self interest  Kelly noted  The next questioner  Cadet Trey Rose  16  asked Kelly to discuss the threat of cyber terrorism   what form it would likely take and how it could be prevented   Cyber  terrorism  is the elephant in the corner  replied Kelly  who mentioned that the nation s electrical grid is particularly vulnerable to a cyber attack  Kelly also noted that far too many individuals are leaving themselves open to cyber crime each day  as studies have shown that the most common passwords used in America is  123456  or simply  password  Just before the program concluded  Gray asked Kelly if the former commissioner had any advice for cadets planning a career in either law enforcement or the military  Describing a career in those fields as  an immediate opportunity to do good  and  a great way to make a living  Kelly counseled   If you re at all inclined in that area  go ahead and give it a shot    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni

McLaughlin LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  2  2015   Former New York Police Department Commissioner Ray Kelly addressed a wide battery of urban and national security concerns in a talk given to a standing room only audience at Virginia Military Institute earlier today  A 50 year veteran of public service  Kelly became police commissioner in 2002  just months after the Sept  11  2001  terrorist attacks  and would go on to become the longest serving commissioner in the city s history  Under his leadership  violent crime in the nation s largest city fell by 40 percent  Kelly was invited to VMI by the H B  Johnson Jr  26 Distinguished Lecture Series     Members of the Leadership Book Program recently read his just published memoir  Vigilance  My Life Serving America and Protecting Its Empire City  Prior to his talk  Kelly discussed his life s work  and the book  during a breakfast gathering with members of the book club  Kelly s talk at the Institute took the form of a moderated question and answer session  with Col  Dave Gray  director of VMI s Center for Leadership and Ethics  serving as the moderator  In attendance were not only a large number of cadets and interested community members  but also a dozen or more police officers from surrounding jurisdictions  While wide ranging  the questions tended to focus on lessons Kelly had learned from his years not only at the NYPD  where he established the first counterterrorism bureau at any municipal police department  but also his years as a U S  Marine  which included time spent in combat during the Vietnam War  Asked about the leadership traits he d learned in the Marine Corps  Kelly talked about many of the qualities a leader should have  among them justice  decisiveness  dependability  tact  loyalty  and enthusiasm   Leaders are made  not born  observed Kelly   You learn basic tenets in the military  and you use them the rest of your life  Kelly recalled that as a company grade officer in Vietnam  he not only had the opportunity to put his leadership skills to the test  but also to learn lessons that would bear fruit down the road at the helm of a police force larger than the FBI  He noted that in many ways  a
