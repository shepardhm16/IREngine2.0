chart  Both frames show an area on the sky approximately 2 x 2 degrees  or a grid of 16 full moons   Andromeda Galaxy and Orion Nebula Images    Images of Comets Orion Nebula Images Using the photographic 5 inch refractor  we have experimented mostly with Fujichrome 400 film  The image below was obtained with a 30 minute exposure  The refractor is mounted on the 20 inch reflector  which serves as a tracking platform in this instance  and a guide star was chosen  with small corrections to the tracking  The transparency was scanned on a flatbed scanner with a transparency adaptor  with backlight  which allows scanning 120 size negatives or transparencies    The Orion Nebula  Messier 42  The famous Orion nebula  in the winter sky  is an area in our Milky Way with formation occurring now  This view shows the correct orientation on the sky  see the corresponding sky chart below The Orion Nebula  Messier 42 This object  and other celestial objects  cannot be seen by just looking
