cavalry unit at VMI  In 1848  VMI s Superintendent Francis H  Smith arranged with a patron to acquire some ten to twenty horses to be stabled at VMI with the view of providing practical instruction in horse artillery drill  The question of horse drawn artillery and cavalry drill was again discussed in the Superintendent s annual report in 1858  Smith wrote   It has been ascertained that the parents of at least thirty cadets are willing to supply temporarily a horse for each  provided the expense of keeping the same can be borne by the Institute  When no horses were available  cadets themselves served as draft animals  Artillery instruction under Major Thomas J  Jackson   Stonewall   was an exhausting affair  with students attempting to maneuver the cannon in response to Jackson s shouted commands  In retaliation  cadets frequently performed pranks such as withdrawing the linchpins from the cannon wheels  or hiding annoying bells on the caisson  The ROTC Era  In December 1916 Superintendent Edward West Nichols informed the VMI community that three units of ROTC   cavalry  field artillery  and infantry   were to be established at the Institute under the National Defense Act of June 1916 The government agreed to furnish horses  forage  and the officers and men necessary to lead the mounted unit  it was left to the institution to provide stables and drill fields A campaign was initiated in early 1917 to solicit contributions from VMI Alumni in support of new program  On July 7  1919  100 horses arrived at VMI along with a detachment of twenty troopers from the 13th Cavalry to care for the animals and provide instruction for the cadets  The stables were ready for use on November 1  1919 and mounted drills started immediately  VMI also established Polo and Horse Show Teams  as well as a Hunt Club  and recreational riding became a part of cadet life in the 1920 s and 1930 s  World War II and the age of mechanization brought an end to horses at VMI  Horsemanship had been taught at the Institute from 1919 until 1942  When horse artillery was stopped in late 1942  the guns were disposed of and the horses transferred from artillery to cavalry  With the end of the cavalry unit in 1946  VMI officials worked out arrangements to retain a small stable of mounts for continued riding instruction and for formal military ceremonies  A small voluntary cavalry troop continued to take part in special reviews  About forty horses remained and made their final appearance at a garrison review during graduation week  June 1948  With the departure of the horses  the stables were remodeled into a building for use by the military science department  an indoor riding hall  built in in 1941  became a field house for basketball and indoor track  If you
