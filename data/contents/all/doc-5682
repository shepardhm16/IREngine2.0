panel session in VMI s  The Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  conference presented an in depth presentation on efforts of the United States Agency for International Development and a more discursive discussion of the need to engage with the African peoples  both focused on U S  approaches to sustainable development in Africa  All four panelists touched on the theme that involvement of the African people is essential  Panel chair Dr  Paul Hebert opened the discussion with a comment on where to start in the international efforts toward sustainable development   There is one platform that could provide a forum for cooperation between China and the United States  he said   and that is the international forum related to the Millennium Development Goals that have been established through the United Nations and endorsed by all of the U N  member states  including China and the United States  These goals are  to end poverty and hunger  to have universal education  to achieve gender equality  child health  maternal health  to combat HIV and AIDS  and to achieve in those goals environmental sustainability and then to have a platform for global partnerships  said Hebert  who was the recipient last spring VMI s Jonathan Daniels Humanitarian Award for his humanitarian work  much of which took placed under the auspices of the United Nations  Hebert established the need for sustainable development  noting that 26 of the 54 countries in Africa rank in the lowest group on the Human Development Index  in which the bottom 10 are all African countries  Hebert defined sustainable development as a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment  a definition further developed by U S  Army Lt  Col  Nancy Jean Louis  who noted that this kind of development requires that the world be seen as a system  a responsibility of civil society as a whole  shared by governments  citizens  institutions  academia  and public and private organizations  During her detailed description of the USAID efforts and successes  Jean Louis said the agency was a prime beneficiary of the work of the U S  Africa Command  founded in 2008  for which she is the representative to USAID   Without security  development is just not going to be sustainable because you will lose your gains  she said  Echoing Jean Louis  remark that development is the responsibility of civil society as a whole  Christopher LaMonica  associate professor of comparative politics at the U S  Coast Guard Academy opened his talk by echoing the elephant metaphor first explored in an earlier panel session   The issue is engaging the elephant  he said   We re going to have to speak to the Africans to determine their needs and the best use of our limited resources  The African peoples  he noted  remember U S  Cold War era policies in Africa  proxy wars  support of dictatorships  and conditionality   We supported monsters  he said   and civil society in Africa suffered as a result  Citing several case study countries  LaMonica noted that the  other elephant in the room  is oil  explaining that where oil is discovered  the economy of the country is completed transformed  with sectors other than oil  such as agriculture   virtually wiped out  Discussant Aaron Tesfaye  professor of political science at William Paterson University  agreed in the session s concluding remarks that the African peoples are the key to sustainable development  Early post colonial governments behaved as the colonial governments had  putting power in the hands of a few African leaders who ignored political structures and indigenous social institutions and cultures   In terms of sustainable development  Africa will not be saved by benevolent individuals    donor nations  or government experts  said Tesfaye   Africa can move forward only if it focuses internally and utilizes the energy of its people  At one time  that energy won people of Africa their independence  It can achieve a second liberation   Development  he added   is a process people do for themselves    Democracy  by making the will of the people the supreme law of development has the potential to unleash their energies but only if they have some genuine decision making powers over their lives   Sherri Tombarge  VMI    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX
