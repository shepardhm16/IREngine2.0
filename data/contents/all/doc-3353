24450 Institute Report  April 2010 First class Cadet Jacob Cox took second place in the science poster division of the recent Undergraduate Research Symposium at the Virginia Military Institute  but he conducted much of his research on film electrolytes and silicon nanowire anodes 3 000 miles away  Last summer  Cox was selected to participate in the National Science Foundation Solid State Chemistry Program with scientists at the University of California Los Angeles  Nanosystems Chemistry and Engineering Research   NanoCER   program  NanoCER supports the NSF program by working in teams that develop new materials  devices and applications in nanotechnology  Cox s team focused on developing an electrolyte that could be used in a three dimensional battery   The way batteries have been designed in the past simply doesn t allow them to power tiny devices effectively  said Cox   As technology gets smaller and smaller  we re losing our ability to actually power those devices  but a battery that has a 3 D architecture should work extremely well on a tiny scale  All batteries  regardless of their design  have an anode  a cathode  and a separating layer  While the solution seems simple  the challenge for the team at UCLA is to design a separating layer that works successfully with the anode and cathode prototypes they ve developed  Cox also worked on a second project that involved etching a silicon wafer with hydrofluoric acid and silver nitrate to form an array of silicon nanowires   It was rough doing two projects at once  but it was really rewarding  and I made a ton of progress  said Cox   Actually  I found myself spending more time in the lab than the grad students  Thanks to the NSF Solid State Chemistry Program  I now have a much better feel for how cutting edge research is conducted at large research labs  a much better understanding of what grad school is like  and insight into what a career in research might look like   Also  the research Dr  Joe Nemanick and I conducted  on the silicon wafer  should be published sometime within the next year  Throughout the eight week experience  Cox presented his work four times  the last was an hour long presentation to his research group  which was comprised of three other undergraduate students and 15 graduate students and post doctoral researchers  That was good preparation for the recent URS poster session and a presentation he made at the Southeast Regional Meeting of the American Chemical Society last October  Maj  Daniel McCain  Cox s mentor at VMI  is pleased with what he has accomplished during his cadetship and that he was able to participate in such a rewarding experience off Post  In fact  the NSF stipend didn t cover all of Cox s expenses  so VMI s chemistry department supported part of his housing costs so he could participate in the program   I did the NSF Solid State Chemistry Program when I was in college  and I know that it helped me decide that I wanted a career in chemistry  said McCain   Jacob is an exceptional student and could go anywhere and achieve anything he desires  The chemistry department has always placed a high value on research as one of the best ways of educating cadets  and most of our chemistry majors do research with a faculty member on Post at some point during their cadetship  but Jacob took the initiative in seeking this unique off Post opportunity  and we wanted to facilitate that  With URS behind him  Cox is finalizing his Institute Honors thesis on enzyme kinetics  Since last spring  he and McCain have been studying an enzyme in humans called PP2C  which is involved in a large number of signaling sequences in the body  They hope the data collected in this project will lead to a better understanding of cellular processes and eventually drug treatments for a variety of diseases  While such a project complements Cox s interest in going to medical school and pursuing research professionally  the time demands of the project have been difficult for a cadet who also is involved in many extracurricular activities  He s held rank for the past three years and is an Institute EMT and volunteers once a week with the Lexington Rescue Squad  He spent a semester at Oxford the summer after his 4th Class year and the spring semester of the next at the Auckland University of Technology  He also is a member of the English Honors Society and has written poetry for the Sounding Brass and the VMI Poetry Symposium  Cox said participating in undergraduate eesearch has made things harder at times   he recently logged approximately four hours each day in the lab finalizing work for his Honors thesis while juggling his extracurricular commitments and preparing for graduation  but the work is paying off  If he can secure funding for his travel and living expenses  he plans to spend a year after graduation with a research team at the University of Yaounde in Cameroon  Africa  that is working to develop new drugs to treat African sleeping sickness  This life threatening disease is endemic to 36 countries in sub Saharan Africa and  according to the World Health Organization  threatens an estimated 60 million people   Despite the time commitment  undergraduate research has really enhanced my education and given me some opportunities I wouldn t have had otherwise  said Cox   I wouldn t have been accepted into the NSF program last summer  and Dr   Barthelemy  Nyasse probably wouldn t be so open to letting me work in his lab next year if I didn t have these research experiences  Also  it s allowed me to get much closer to my professors than I otherwise would have  and Maj  McCain and I have become good friends  Most importantly  Cox said  his research has enhanced his understanding of science   Science isn t done by reading through a book and working the problems at the end of each chapter  he said   It s done in the lab  It s all about research and publications  and my work here has taught me that  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents   Families   Cadets   Non discrimination
