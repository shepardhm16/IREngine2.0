philosophy  he said   We don t make progress  If anything  what we re trying to do is show people that progress is not always what they need  Agam Segal s classes  which this year will include logic  Greek and medieval philosophy  and one on minds and machines  challenge cadets to question what they think they know  An example  he said  is skepticism of other minds   How do you know that I see anything  You have your senses to sense with  but you don t have mine  How do you know that anyone else senses anything    Maybe you are the only sensing person in the world  the only one with a mind  In broad terms  he said  philosophy begins when students find themselves someplace bizarre and unfamiliar  it helps them find a way back  Along the way  they learn to find meaning   A lot of what philosophers do is try to restore safety  said Agam Segal  Imagine a fly entering a bottle with honey inside  The fly cannot find the way out and becomes trapped  But  he said   The way is open  The bottle is not sealed  There always is a way out  Solving a philosophical problem is not making progress  rather it s returning to a place we have been in before  a place that is familiar to us  Agam Segal  a native of Israel who came to VMI from Auburn University  brings to his classroom his own experience in the Israeli military  He notes that the kind of thinking he asks of his students can be of particular value to those heading for military careers  Students facing moral questions are very like that fly in the bottle  he said   When the world doesn t make sense in terms of good and bad  then the world becomes foreign and frightening  and cadets are thinking about ethics all the time    Having the right language  knowing how to make sense of your question  is important  Just being able to recognize that you re stuck is tremendously important  Agam Segal has been helping them do just that in the classroom and at meetings of the cadet Ethics Club  formerly the Philosophy Club  for which he and philosophy professor Duncan Richter serve as faculty advisers  The club  which meets weekly to discuss topics of interest to the cadets  such as the ethics of drones  has been growing  Agam Segal said he encourages cadets to play devil s advocate  to argue against themselves  and to force themselves to explain and give examples  Thus they learn to see themselves through self examination   When students discover that they can do philosophy  he said   it s like discovering a new sense  The new professorship in philosophy was funded through a grant from the Jackson Hope Fund
