and sun filled day  Virginia Military Institute celebrated the 175th anniversary of its founding yesterday with the placement of a time capsule  a convocation speech by Gov  Terry McAuliffe  and a parade by the Corps of Cadets  The day s events began with a morning ceremony in LeJeune Hall  during which members of the Corps of Cadets placed items into a time capsule  which will be displayed in the VMI Museum until it is opened 50 years from now  in 2064  To Become a Citizen Soldier  Biographer Discusses Col  J T L  Preston on Founders Day LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  12  2014   As part of the Founders Day ceremonies at Virginia Military Institute yesterday  author Randolph Shaffner visited post to discuss his new book  The Father of VMI  A Biography of Col  J T L  Preston  C S A  Preston  a prominent 19th century Lexington citizen  led an effort in the 1830s to have a state arsenal staffed by bored and ill behaved young men transformed into a new kind of military school based on the Roman ideal of the citizen soldier  In his remarks  Shaffner noted that while Preston is well known as the founder of VMI  and those in his inner circle have been the subject of many biographies  there has been very little written about him   and during his lifetime  that was just as Preston liked it  as the Lexington attorney was well known for his eschewal of fame and even recognition  Shaffner noted that Preston was ambitious almost from birth  graduating from Washington College  now Washington and Lee University  at the tender age of 17  and going on to study law at Yale College  now Yale University  In Lexington  he was known for his prodigious memory and high skill as a debater   Thoroughly trained in rhetoric and oratory  he could mold  sway  lead  pressure  and define almost any cause  said Shaffner of Preston   His friends knew him personally as a man of iron will  strong personality  high character  and lofty purposes  In cultivating such a character  Preston drew upon the model of Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus  a Roman who was twice called from his farm to serve his country in time of war  and George Washington  who himself had emulated Cincinnatus   Preston had Cincinnatus in mind when he defined VMI as something different from West Point  said Shaffner   The concept of the citizen soldier was one that J T L  Preston adopted from his knowledge of early Roman history when he attempted to define VMI as we know it today  Shaffner noted that whereas the United States Military Academy has as its goal producing professional soldiers  the new school Preston was championing was designed to produce graduates who would be citizens first and soldiers second   As Preston defined it  VMI was the first school in the South to aim at defining moral and spiritual maturity under the military system of discipline  said Shaffner   VMI lives as an embodiment of this man s mind and heart  Copies of The Father of VMI  A Biography of Col  J T L  Preston  C S A  are available at the VMI museum shop and also at the museum shop at the Stonewall Jackson House   Mary Price   Among the 22 items in the black plastic container are items reflective of cadet life today  including a 1st Class private belt buckle  the original VMI buckle in use since the 19th century  a class dyke belt buckle  which is worn by 4th class cadets  3rd class cadets  and 2nd class privates  a Rat Bible  and the class year patches worn on the sleeves of cadet duty jackets  Other notable items include a football from VMI s first Southern Conference win  over Furman University in November 1931  a map of the George Washington National Forest  the location of the 4th Class field training exercises  and a room inspection or  bone sheet  familiar to generations of VMI alumni  The time capsule  a project that has been in the works since the fall of 2013  is only the third such capsule known to be placed at VMI in the Institute s nearly two centuries of existence  The first was placed at the foot of the statue Virginia Mourning Her Dead in 1903  and opened in 1932  The second  which is yet to be opened  was placed at the foot of the statue of Confederate Gen  Thomas J   Stonewall  Jackson outside of barracks in 1989  when the Institute was celebrating its 150th anniversary   Time capsules seemed to address our need to remember the past and speak to the future at the same time  noted Cadet Will Connerley  president of the Class of 2015  addressing a small crowd gathered in the foyer of LeJeune Hall for the placement ceremony  In his remarks  Connerley pondered the adult lives yet to be lived by the cadets now enrolled at VMI   What do we wish to say to generations yet unborn  asked Connerley rhetorically   What will our legacy be  as represented by our time capsule    When we return for our 50th reunion and open the capsule  we will have fulfilled in many yet unforeseen ways the promise of duty to country and service to our fellow man that awaits us   Never Be Afraid to Fail  Speaking at an afternoon convocation in VMI s Cameron Hall  McAuliffe urged the VMI Corps of Cadets to think big and take chances as they move Virginia s economy into the 21st century  McAuliffe  who is in his first year in office  told the audience of cadets  faculty  members of the Board of Visitors  and others that Virginia s economy has been dependent on Department of Defense spending for many years  but that economic lifeblood is rapidly diminishing   We have to diversify  our economy  said McAuliffe  noting that defense spending in the commonwealth has declined by over  9 billion in the past three years alone  If sequestration comes through as expected  he noted   90 billion in defense spending will likely be cut  In urging the cadets to reach for their goals  McAuliffe noted that his parents were too poor to send him to college  so he went to work sealing driveways at 14  Over the years  McAuliffe would find himself at the helm of many business ventures   and not all were destined to succeed   Never be afraid to fail  the former chair of the Democratic National Committee counseled his cadet listeners   Think big  Take chances  McAuliffe can t be accused of giving advice he didn t follow himself  By the time he was 30  McAuliffe had become the nation s youngest bank chairman  and by 2009 he was leading Hillary Clinton s campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination  That same year  he noted  he met defeat in his first run for governor   but that didn t stop him from running again   I wanted to take those big risks and big gambles  and you do  too  said McAuliffe   That s why you came to VMI  In his remarks  delivered on Veterans Day   a holiday that was established well after VMI s founding   McAuliffe also touched on veterans  issues  specifically the need to end homelessness among veterans and the need for more health care options for those who ve served  Pausing for emphasis before delivering the news  McAuliffe told his listeners that Virginia ranks last in the nation in its number of veterans  hospitals per capita   Veterans  have to wait too long and drive too far to get health care  he stated   We re going to end that under my term as governor  Speaking to the cadets in the audience who are planning to commission in the armed services  McAuliffe pledged   Your commonwealth is going to have your back while you re in the service  Concluding his remarks  McAuliffe began to hint that he had a special gift to share with the cadets   and the Corps began to roar with anticipation  well knowing that the governor  as commander in chief  has the power to grant amnesty for penalty tours and confinements  McAuliffe did grant amnesty   but only in exchange for a promise of hard work and dedication from the Corps   Never forget the legacy you are inheriting as the next generation of citizen soldiers to graduate from this proud institution  McAuliffe reminded the cadets   Look into the Future with Confidence  Celebrated each year since the Institute s beginning  Founders Day marks the anniversary of a snowy Monday   Nov  11  1839   when the first cadets arrived to relieve the command at what had been a state arsenal  The new school s success was far from certain  Gen  J H  Binford Peay III  VMI superintendent  reminded his listeners at Tuesday s convocation  as there had been an economic downturn in the late 1830s which dried up state funding  The founders   Gen  Francis H  Smith  French engineer Claudius Crozet  and prominent Lexington attorney Col  J T L  Preston   were not to be deterred  Peay observed   But they persevered and they succeeded  and the Institute has moved on through many other financial crises   to reach a new level of excellence that even the forward looking founders could never have imagined  Just as McAuliffe would go on to tell the cadets  the founders of VMI had thought big  and taken chances   All three men had one characteristic in common  said Peay   They looked into the future with confidence  not only for the new college which they had helped organize  but also for the nation    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni
