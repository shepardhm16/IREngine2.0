Best Bang for the Buck  category    VMI File Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Aug  24  2015   Virginia Military Institute has been ranked 26th in the Southeast region in the  Best Bang for the Buck  category and 1st nationally among all liberal arts colleges for ROTC participation in the 2015 Washington Monthly college rankings  released today  The intent of the  Best Bang for the Buck  category is to showcase schools that enable students of modest means to obtain an education at a reasonable price  In that category  over 1 500 schools from around the country are rated using five criteria  student loan default rate  graduation rate  graduation rate performance  the percentage of Pell Grant recipients  and net price of attendance  In the 2015 rankings  VMI is placed just behind the College of William   Mary and just ahead of The Citadel  Virginia Tech was ranked 34th  Using data from the federal government  Washington Monthly reports VMI s student loan default rate for the years 2008 to 2011 as 3 5 percent  The Institute s six year graduation rate for first time students for the time period of 2010 to 2012 was 70 percent  Graduation rate performance is the difference between the school s predicted graduation rate and its actual graduation rate  It s calculated using a formula that includes the percentage of Pell Grant recipients and students receiving student loans  the average ACT SAT score  the admit rate  the racial ethnic and gender makeup of the student body  the number of students  overall and full time  and institutional characteristics such as whether a college is primarily residential  VMI scored a 17 in this category  which was compiled using data from 2010 to 2012  At VMI from 2009 to 2012  6 5 percent of the Corps of Cadets received Pell Grants  which are federal funds given to the neediest students  The average net cost of attendance at VMI for cadets receiving any form of financial aid was  12 409  That figure is based on data from 2009 to 2012  Washington Monthly has been rating colleges since 2005  with the  Best Bang for the Buck  category included since 2012  The magazine also publishes a college guide in book format
