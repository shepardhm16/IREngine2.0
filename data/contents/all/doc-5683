Republic of China    Photo courtesy of the Center for Leadership and Ethics  LEXINGTON  Va  Nov  4  2011   The fourth panel in the conference  The Eagle and the Dragon in Africa  touched on two U S  government strategic goals in Africa  said retired U S  ambassador to Chad Louis J  Nigro Jr  the panel chair  mitigation of the effects of conflict and prevention of conflict  Addressing the first  Dr  Reuben Brigety  deputy assistant secretary of the Bureau of Population  Refugees and Migration in the U S  Department of State  gave a broad overview of the population currently in need of care and the challenges the bureau faces and the strategies it employs in efforts to meet that need  Though the number of refugees  those who cross international borders to find safety  has decreased over the last 15 years  the number of internally displaced people  also known as IDPs  who have left their homes to find safety but remain in their home countries  has doubled in that time   Which means that  broadly speaking  the number of IDPs that we are concerned about all around the world is increased dramatically largely as a result of an increase in non international armed conflict or other sorts of disturbances  said Brigety  This kind of conflict is the dominant kind of war in Africa  said VMI s own Col  Jim Hentz  professor of international studies  who followed Brigety on stage  International wars  he said  are rare in Africa  civil wars  where a group challenges the government or attempts to secede  are also rare  But wars in Africa are not simply random inexplicable violence  they follow a pattern Hentz calls  wars across states  they tend to take place on the periphery of weak states and spread across borders  they may or may not involve the government   participants may be militia groups and other hybrids  and there is no linear progression from war to state  as took place during the formation of the nations of Europe  These wars across states may be prolonged  as in the Democratic Republic of Congo  which  Hentz said  has been at war since 1996 and is no closer to statehood than at the start of the fighting   Every refugee situation in the world is either precipitated or prolonged by armed conflict  Brigety had pointed out  And these wars generate  apparently  even greater numbers of internally displaced people than refugees   For IDPs  generally speaking  the host government still has responsibility for protecting them    even if it is from the host government that they flee  And they aren t protected by international law in the same way that refugees are  making the job of his bureau and other agencies seeking to mitigate the effects of these conflicts more difficult  said Brigety  Even for refugees  durable solutions   return to safety in the home country  integration in the adopted country  or resettlement in a third country   are extremely difficult to achieve  Brigety said  The United States  he said  is the largest resettlement country in the world  by far  but even so only a small percentage  the most vulnerable  are resettled  Hentz and Brigety offered the audience an understanding of the big picture of war and peace in Africa  while discussant Anna Linn Persson  brought the perspective of the situation on the ground in the DRC  where she works as senior civilian observer for MONUSCO   the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Showing slides of people she has met in her work  she asked the question  what do they need  And answered it  What does the police officer need  He needs a salary  so he does not have to charge individuals for his services  he needs fuel  so he can use the vehicle parked out front to get to the scene of the looting before the looters get away or are killed by a mob taking law into their own hands  What does the civil servant need  He needs electricity so he can use his computer  What do the women need  They need their sons to come home to take their places in the household  they need to not live in fear of violence  of rape  From the point of view of the individual citizen of DRC  said Persson   He or she doesn t really care that much where help comes from  whether it comes from the United States or China or somewhere else  And  she said   What the people of the DRC need are leaders that care for the people and the resources and take the responsibility for protection for the civilians   Sherri Tombarge   VMI    VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title
