Literacy a Prerequisite Dr  Neil deGrasse Tyson offers the closing address to VMI s STEM education conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  3  2012   VMI s STEM education conference ended with a bang  as Dr  Neil deGrasse Tyson  director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History  brought conference attendees and cadets to their feet in a passionate round of applause  During the course of his talk  Tyson examined what happens when communities and nations care about aptitude in STEM fields and what happens when they don t   The talk should be titled  Adventures in Science Illiteracy  said Tyson   I ll be bringing you examples of what I ve seen in my walks through life that drive home why I think science literacy is not just important for STEM literacy in general   It  not just important for the training of the mind  it s important for all manner of subjects  including national security  including economic competitiveness  so it s not just for personal intellectual enlightenment  It goes much deeper than that  Tyson noted recent infrastructure failures  including the levies in New Orleans breaking during Hurricane Katrina  the Interstate 35 bridge collapse  and steam pipes rupturing in New York City   Let s wake up and smell what s going on here  said Tyson   People die when this happens  In addition to looking at tangible issues like crumbling infrastructure  Tyson examined some of the products of irrationality in America  such as fear of the number 13 and the belief that the world will end later this year   Here s a book  How To Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction  I bought this book  I read this book  I heeded its advice  That s why I m here to talk to you  said Tyson   Somebody got this put on

enthusiasm for science around the world   In Germany they have math on their currency  said Tyson   If you re a kid looking at that  you wouldn t understand it when you first saw it  You might be curious about it  It might trigger later an interest in what you end up studying  There was a time when that kind of national enthusiasm was present in America  Tyson pointed out that when America had a strong space program  it wasn t necessary to set up special initiatives  such as this very conference  to convince individuals that STEM fields are interesting   In the 1960s we didn t need such programs because we were going to the moon  We were reaching for an unreachable target that all of history said could not be done  said Tyson   People were climbing over themselves to get into the physics classes  into the math classes  Tyson sees hope in the next generation of graduates to reverse the trend of STEM illiteracy   All of you are uniquely positioned to not only reverse that trend  but restore America to what so many of us remember it to be firsthand  and so many of the rest of us read about  those days where America essentially led the world in every possible way we could

Literacy a Prerequisite Dr  Neil deGrasse Tyson offers the closing address to VMI s STEM education conference    VMI Photo by John Robertson IV  LEXINGTON  Va  Oct  3  2012   VMI s STEM education conference ended with a bang  as Dr  Neil deGrasse Tyson  director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History  brought conference attendees and cadets to their feet in a

should be titled  Adventures in Science Illiteracy  said Tyson   I ll be bringing you examples of what I ve seen in my walks through life that drive home why I think science literacy is not just important for STEM literacy in general   It  not just important for the training of the mind  it s important for all manner of subjects  including national security  including economic competitiveness  so it s not just for personal intellectual enlightenment  It goes much deeper than that  Tyson noted recent infrastructure failures  including the levies in New Orleans breaking during Hurricane Katrina  the Interstate 35 bridge collapse  and steam pipes rupturing in New York City   Let s wake up and smell what s going on here  said Tyson   People die when this happens  In addition to looking at tangible issues like crumbling infrastructure  Tyson examined some of the products of irrationality in America  such as fear of the number 13 and the belief that the world will end later this year   Here s a book  How To Defend Yourself Against Alien Abduction  I bought this book  I read this book  I heeded its advice  That s why I m here to talk to you  said Tyson   Somebody got this put on shelves  What country is this  and what year is this  Tyson displayed currencies from other countries which feature those nations  contributions to science as a way of demonstrating the national enthusiasm for science around the world   In Germany they have math on their currency  said Tyson   If you re a kid looking at that  you wouldn t understand it when you first saw it  You might be curious about it  It might trigger later an interest in what you end up studying  There was a time when that kind of national enthusiasm was present in America  Tyson pointed out that when America had a strong space program  it wasn t necessary to set up special initiatives  such as this very conference  to convince individuals that STEM fields are interesting   In the 1960s we didn t need such programs because we were going to the moon  We were reaching for an unreachable target that all of history said could not be done  said Tyson   People were climbing over themselves to get into the physics classes  into the math classes  Tyson sees hope in the next generation of graduates to reverse the trend of STEM illiteracy   All of you are uniquely positioned to not only reverse that trend  but restore America to what so many of us remember it to be firsthand  and so many of the rest of us read about  those days where America essentially led the world in every possible way we could measure it  It s in your hands to make that happen again   John Robertson IV   VMI  Related Articles State Secretary of Education Opens VMI STEM Conference   Teaching Math and Science to the World
