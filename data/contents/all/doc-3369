Institute grants written approval for the research to be conducted  Research involving the use of educational tests  cognitive  diagnostic  aptitude  achievement  survey procedures  interview procedures or observation of public behavior  unless   a  information obtained is recorded in such a manner that human subjects can be identified  directly  or through identifiers linked to the subjects  and  b  any disclosure of the human subjects  responses outside the research could reasonably place the subjects at risk for criminal or civil liability or be damaging to the subjects  financial standing  employability  or reputation  NOTE  Sensitive survey research is not exempt  A sensitive survey is one that deals with sensitive or highly personal aspects of the subject s behavior  life experiences or attitudes  Examples include chemical substance abuse  sexual activity or attitudes  sexual abuse  criminal behavior  sensitive demographic data  detailed health history  etc  The principal determination of sensitivity is whether or not the survey research presents a potential risk to the subject in terms of possible precipitation of a negative emotional reaction  An additional risk consideration is  of course  whether or not there is risk associated with a breach of confidentiality should one occur  With respect to potential psychological risk associated with a survey  the presence or absence of subject identifiers is not necessarily a consideration since the risk may be primarily associated with the sensitive nature of the survey as opposed to being dependent upon confidentiality  Subject identifiers do  however  become a factor when confidentiality is an issue  NOTE  When children are involved as subjects in research using survey or interview procedures  the research is not exempt  NOTE  When children are involved as subjects in research using observation techniques  the research is not exempt  NOTE  Observation research involving sensitive aspects of a subject s behavior is not exempt  Research involving the use of educational tests  cognitive  diagnostic  aptitude  achievement  survey procedures  interview procedures  or
