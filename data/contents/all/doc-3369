there is risk associated with a breach of confidentiality should one occur  With respect to potential psychological risk associated with a survey  the presence or absence of subject identifiers is not necessarily a consideration since the risk may be primarily associated with the sensitive nature of the survey as opposed to being dependent upon confidentiality  Subject identifiers do  however  become a factor when confidentiality is an issue  NOTE  When children are involved as subjects in research using survey or interview procedures  the research is not exempt  NOTE  When children are
