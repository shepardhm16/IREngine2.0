oldest of the engineering professions  broadest in scope  and parent of all other branches of engineering  The curriculum  includes courses that permit our graduates to pursue any of the specialty areas in Civil Engineering  Cadets may choose to concentrate in one of  the sub disciplines of Civil Engineering or select courses across all topic areas for a more general focus  High School Preparation Prepare by taking the full college preparatory program augmented by as many math and science courses as your schedule permits  Courses in engineering drawing  drafting  and computer programming are recommended  but they should not be taken in lieu of elements of the college preparatory sequence          The Power of EngineeringA team of cadets majoring in civil engineering at VMI
