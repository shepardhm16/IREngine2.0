Paradigm with a Problem  The current mathematics publishing paradigm produces quality textbooks  but they come with significant shortcomings  They are cumbersome and static   New edition  update cycles are often tied more to ensuring continued profit for publishers than to ensuring valuable content  and the books are expensive  Writing these textbooks makes great demands on authors  who typically juggle authorship with teaching  research  and committee responsibilities  And  ultimately  the effort must be collaborative  drawing on comments from colleagues who review the texts and complemented by the work of professional editors and graphic artists  And even then a quality product is not ensured  The open textbook movement addresses some of these shortcomings by offering flexible  low cost alternatives  The source files are open under generous copyright restrictions  allowing users to edit the text to suit their purposes  The update cycle is geared toward fixing mistakes and adding valuable content  not toward making a profit  The APEX Solution The Affordable Print and Electronic TeXtbook  APEX  model for writing textbooks  developed here at VMI  provides a way to produce high quality  inexpensive textbooks  without burdening an individual author with the weight of the entire project  In APEX  a group of like minded colleagues collaborates so that the commitment of time and resources for each individual is manageable  Some write the text  while others write exercises or produce graphics  Some edit  ensuring the text has consistent voicing  while still others write LaTeX or other macros or review the text  The APEX concept was developed at VMI during the production of matrix algebra and MATLAB Mathcad texts  Each was written primarily by one author  with minimal collaboration from others Then  in the fall of 2011  with course releases made possible by the award of a Jackson Hope New Directions in Teaching and Research grant  professor of applied mathematics Col  Gregory Hartman implemented the APEX model  working with three colleagues to write  and a fourth to edit  a calculus text  The textbook covers Calculus I through Calculus III and is used in VMI s calculus courses  Contributing authors are Col  Troy Siemers and Lt  Col  Dimplekumar Chalishajar of VMI s Department of Applied Mathematics and Brian Heinold  Department of Mathematics and Computer Science  Mount Saint Mary s University  the editor is Jennifer Bowen  Department of Mathematics and Computer Science  The College of Wooster  For more information about APEX

level class  provides an introduction to programming and problem solving using both MATLAB and Mathcad  A balanced selection of introductory exercises and real world problems  i e  no  contrived  problems  including examples and screenshots  guides the student  who does not need prior knowledge of MATLAB or Mathcad to complete the course  This text is covered by the Creative Commons

college level treatment of standard calculus topics  beginning with limits and ending with iterated  multivariable  integration  The material is presented in a traditional format  designed to make the transition from popular calculus books easier  Suitable for most Calculus I  II  and III courses  the text is currently in use in VMI s MA 123  124  and 215  as well as Calculus and Analytic Geometry I  II  and III  The entire text can be purchased in three volumes from Amazon com  15 each  search for  APEX calculus  The texts are black and white to reduce costs  Older versions are also available  More information can be found at www apexcalculus com  Color versions of each volume  available as PDFs below  are more aesthetically pleasing  though the black and white versions  also below  are better suited for printing    Calculus I  Covers limits  derivatives  and an introduction to integration   Used in MA 123  Color   Black and White Calculus II  Covers integration  techniques and applications of integration  sequences  and series   Used in MA 124  Color   Black and White   Calculus III  Covers conic sections  parametric equations  polar coordinates and functions  vectors and vector related functions  and multivariable functions  including partial derivatives and iterated integration   Used in MA 215  Color   Black and White Calculus I  II  III Color Black and White   Source Files The source files can be found at github com APEXCalculus  To get the whole book  run the file Calculus tex  Calculus I is created with CalculusI tex  etc  Running these  tex files is not for the faint of heart  they are designed to run under XeLaTeX using the Calibri font  Anyone interested in working with the authors to clean up the TeX code is invited to contact them  This text is
