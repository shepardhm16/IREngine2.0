Affordable Print and Electronic TeXtbooks Textbook Publishing   A Paradigm with a Problem  The current mathematics publishing paradigm produces quality textbooks  but they come with significant shortcomings  They are cumbersome and static   New edition  update cycles are often tied more to ensuring continued profit for publishers than to ensuring valuable content  and the books are expensive  Writing these textbooks makes great demands on authors  who typically juggle authorship with teaching  research  and committee responsibilities  And  ultimately  the effort must be collaborative  drawing on comments from colleagues who review the texts and complemented by the work of professional editors and graphic artists  And even then a quality product is not ensured  The open textbook movement addresses some of these shortcomings by offering flexible  low cost alternatives  The source files are open under generous copyright restrictions  allowing users to edit the text to suit their purposes  The update cycle is geared toward fixing mistakes and adding valuable content  not toward making a profit  The APEX Solution The Affordable Print and Electronic TeXtbook  APEX  model for writing textbooks  developed here at VMI  provides a way to produce high quality  inexpensive textbooks  without burdening an individual author with the weight of the entire project  In APEX  a group of like minded colleagues collaborates so that the commitment of time and resources for each individual is manageable  Some write the text  while others write exercises or produce graphics  Some edit  ensuring the text has consistent voicing  while still others write LaTeX or other macros or review the text  The APEX concept was developed at VMI during the production of matrix algebra and MATLAB Mathcad texts  Each was written primarily by one author  with minimal collaboration from others Then  in the fall of 2011  with course releases made possible by the award of a Jackson Hope New Directions in Teaching and Research grant  professor of applied mathematics Col  Gregory Hartman implemented the APEX model  working with three colleagues to write  and a fourth to edit  a calculus

Electronic TeXtbooks Textbook Publishing   A Paradigm with a Problem  The current mathematics publishing paradigm produces quality textbooks  but they come with significant shortcomings  They are cumbersome and static   New edition  update cycles are often tied more to ensuring continued profit for publishers than to ensuring valuable content  and the books are expensive  Writing these textbooks makes great demands on authors  who typically juggle authorship with teaching  research  and committee responsibilities  And  ultimately  the effort must be collaborative  drawing on comments from colleagues who review the texts and complemented by the work of professional editors and graphic artists  And even then a quality product is not ensured  The open textbook movement addresses some of these shortcomings by offering flexible  low cost alternatives  The source files are open under generous copyright restrictions  allowing users to edit the text to suit their purposes  The update cycle is geared toward fixing mistakes and adding valuable content  not toward making a profit  The APEX Solution The Affordable Print and Electronic TeXtbook  APEX  model for

review the texts and complemented by the work of professional editors and graphic artists  And even then a quality product is not ensured The open textbook movement addresses some of these shortcomings by offering flexible  low cost alternatives  The source files are open under generous copyright restrictions  allowing users to edit the text to suit their purposes  The update cycle is geared toward fixing mistakes and adding valuable content  not toward making a profit The APEX Solution The APEX Solution The Affordable Print and Electronic TeXtbook  APEX  model for writing textbooks  developed here at VMI  provides a way to produce high quality  inexpensive textbooks  without burdening an individual author with the weight of the entire project In APEX  a group of like minded colleagues collaborates so that the commitment of time and resources for each individual is manageable  Some write the text  while others write exercises or produce graphics  Some edit  ensuring the text has consistent voicing  while still others write LaTeX or other macros or review the text The APEX concept was developed at VMI during the production of matrix algebra and MATLAB Mathcad texts  Each was written primarily by one author  with minimal collaboration from others Then  in the fall of 2011  with course releases made possible by the award of a Jackson Hope New Directions in Teaching and Research grant  professor of applied mathematics Col  Gregory Hartman implemented the APEX model  working with three colleagues to write  and a fourth to edit  a calculus text  The textbook covers Calculus I through Calculus III and is used in VMI s calculus courses  Contributing authors are Col  Troy Siemers and Lt  Col  Dimplekumar Chalishajar of VMI s Department of Applied Mathematics and Brian Heinold  Department of Mathematics and Computer Science  Mount Saint Mary s University  the editor is Jennifer Bowen  Department of Mathematics and Computer Science  The College of Wooster For more information about APEX  please contact Col  Troy Siemers or Col  Gregory Hartman Col  Troy Siemers Col  Gregory Hartman APEX Texts APEX Texts Fundamentals of Matrix Algebra

integration  The material is presented in a traditional format  designed to make the transition from popular calculus books easier  Suitable for most Calculus I  II  and III courses  the text is currently in use in VMI s MA 123  124  and 215  as well as Calculus and Analytic Geometry I  II  and III Calculus Calculus The entire text can be purchased in three volumes from Amazon com  15 each
