served as the thirty seventh president  His foreign policy accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East  Online video system requirements  QuickTime 7 player  or equivalent  More

in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle

served as the thirty seventh president  His foreign policy accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East  Online video system requirements  QuickTime 7 player  or equivalent  More

in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle

accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned

isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and

accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East  Online video system requirements  QuickTime 7 player  or equivalent  More information on this video  http www pbs org wnet historyofus  http

accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East  Online video system requirements  QuickTime 7 player  or equivalent  More information on this video  http www pbs org wnet historyofus  http

served as the thirty seventh president  His foreign policy accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East  Online video system requirements  QuickTime 7 player  or equivalent  More

foreign policy accomplishments rank his tenure as one of the most dynamic in presidential history  Inheriting the war in Vietnam from previous administrations  Nixon first sought a military solution  but then turned to diplomacy to end United States  involvement  By approaching Communist China in a historic visit in 1972  Nixon drove a wedge into the powerful Soviet Chinese block  which began to diplomatically isolate the various Communist dominated countries around the world  This strategy not only ended the war in Vietnam  1973  but also led to the first nuclear arms treaty with the Soviet Union and limited the spread of Soviet influence in the Middle East  Online video system requirements  QuickTime 7 player  or equivalent   More information on this video  http www pbs org wnet
