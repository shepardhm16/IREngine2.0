EWB chapter was established  work began immediately  The VMI group linked up with students from Washington   Lee and began designing the new water and irrigation system for the people of Pampoyo  Since the group hadn t actually visited the site the work was challenging  With help from a professional chapter of Engineers Without Borders  the group managed to pull together a hearty design for the system and collectively developed a solid plan for implementation  The design was simple  but the difficulty of implementation was yet to be seen  none of us understood the implication of performing manual labor at 13 000  feet  Either way  the goal was the same  help those in need and provide a preferential option for the people of Pampoyo  With that goal in mind  the work came easy  Let me start by first explaining the problem  Pampoyo  once a bustling small town in the Andes Mountains was dying  their way of life  agriculture and livestock was being compromised  The only source of water in the area was contaminated with heavy metals such as lead  silver and copper due to mine tailings waste from years of unregulated mining in the area  The contamination was causing issues in the community that had far reaching consequences  The water was used for irrigation of the crops  watering of the livestock and sadly enough  drinking  Child mortality in the area was close to 50  and the community was noticing personal health issues  The nearest hospital was a three hour walk into the nearest town of Potosi and crops and livestock were dying from poor water quality and refusal to drink  The population in the town was dwindling either from illness or from people simply moving away to find work and a better way of life  The town cried out for help  and EWB VMI heard the call  Working tirelessly  the students designed a two phase project  Phase I   build a catchment basin  or dam  to capture clean spring water upstream of the contamination and install 2 000 feet of 1 5 inch polyethylene pipe and Phase II   install an additional 8 000 feet of polyethylene pipe and two 6 000 liter tanks for water storage and distribution to the town and the crops  The group was supervised by professional engineers and plans were drawn up  The next step was to raise the funds for materials  construction and travel  By all accounts  a daunting task if work was being conducted in the U S   A project of this size would have easily cost more than  250 000  The fundraising goal for Phase I  a mere  5 000  Students reached out to family  friends and alumni via social media and local rotary clubs helped to raise a substantial portion of the money  The VMI Civil Engineering department was also very helpful with fundraising efforts as well  Funds were raised and travel to Pampoyo was set for July 2011   Funds are currently being raised for Phase II  the installation of 8 000 feet of polyethylene pipe and two 6 000 liter tanks  Distribution piping will also be purchased and installed  The new goal    30 000  your support is appreciated  Stay tuned for the next post   Travel to Pampoyo and Implementation of the Plan  Tweet 4 Comments November 5  2011 Blog Comments Liz Moore November 8  2011 at 3 21 pm   Reply I really appreciate this post  as someone who is 100  on board with the project  I still did not fully understand the gravity of the situation and how contaminated the water was and its overall affects  As a non engineer and non scientist  I appreciate the easy to understand explanation of the project and the outcomes  The work of the group and how much you accomplished in such a short amount of time is both impressive and inspiring  I am so excited  great strides in research and hands on work at VMI  an illustration of what being a citizen soldier is all about  and providing much needed and deserved clean natural resources to Pampoyo  I love this  You have my support VMI EWB  Tim Moore November 8  2011 at 11 21 pm   Reply Thanks Liz  your comments inspire us to continue our efforts for Pampoyo  With supporters like you  we can continue to deliver the much needed support the people of Pampoyo deserve  Thanks again for your kind words  Carrie Wortham November

usually get the head nod in agreement  Most people these days are so busy they don t remember the last time they truly relaxed or did something for someone else  That s how I was feeling anyway  as I became involved in a humanitarian effort to provide clean water for an impoverished village in Bolivia  After a discussion with my professor  MAJ Tim Moore  and a few conversations with some friends  the Virginia Military Institute s first international community service club was formed  The VMI and Washington and Lee Chapter of Engineers Without Borders  a nonprofit organization that encourages people of all backgrounds to provide clean water and sanitation for underdeveloped communities all over the world  coordinated the efforts of students of all majors  faculty  and professionals to build an irrigation system in Pampoyo  Bolivia  After months of designing  planning  and fundraising  our club made a trip to South America to help install the dam and piping system  The Bolivians in Pampoyo now have clean water to drink and to water their animals  After that trip and returning to VMI for my senior year  I have a new appreciation for work and what it means to be busy  I thought I was going to Bolivia to change people s lives by providing clean water for their families and livestock  but I realize that it was my life that was in need of the change  My involvement in Engineers Without Borders had been mediocre  Sure  I was acting president and helping organize the trip and fundraising  but my heart was not in line with my actions  I was too consumed by my school work  athletics  and society s idea of achievement  Bolivia  simply put  realigned my motives and goals  I ask myself  What is the value of work  whether it by studying for a test  sitting in an office  or digging a dam  when you are driven by an external force that gives you no sense of purpose  I am still asking myself that question as I look to post graduation  but I now know that without an answer  I will just be busy  I am confident that the people of Bolivia will faithfully remind me how my heart and mind aligns  Tim Moore November 29  2011 at 2 02 am   Reply Well said Carrie  thanks for your
