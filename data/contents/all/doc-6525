Encourages Cadets to Apply Their Skills The old saying that an inventor should be able to build a better mousetrap just might be appropriate in VMI s mechanical engineering department   but instead of mousetraps  3rd Class cadets in that department are building devices to crush soda cans this year   To be a good engineer  you have to marry theory with application  said Col  Jon Michael Hardin  professor of mechanical engineering  To this end  a recent initiative in the department encourages cadets to apply their engineering skills to real world projects from the beginning of their

fun engineering is   The practice of engineering is just a hoot  It s just plain fun  After becoming chair of the department in 2010  Hardin wasted little time in revamping the curriculum toward more application  and hopefully more enjoyment as well  through an experiential learning approach  By the fall of 2011  a small group of 4th Class cadets was building hovercrafts  which travel along land or water on a cushion of air  By the next year  that project was expanded to include all 4th Class mechanical engineering majors  This year s 3rd Class cadets got their first taste of hands on engineering during the hovercraft project last year  This past fall  they learned about statics  or the relationship between forces in a structure  and used their newfound knowledge to design can crushers  Now  as part of their solid mechanics class  they are working in the shop to build them   The cadets are  invested in it  said Col  Jay Sullivan  professor of mechanical engineering  who taught statics in the fall and is now teaching the solid mechanics class   It s their own design  their own analysis  The can crusher  is not a book problem  he added   It s their own problem  Likely because of this  said Hardin  the cadets have shown an interest that s truly contagious  While the cadets were designing their can crushers in the fall  he said   I would walk out into the study area

cadets put their engineering skills to use as early as possible  they believe  will help with retention and motivation  Last year  the department surveyed its 4th Class cadets about their like or dislike of open ended problem solving  and also their likelihood of switching majors  The results  which were presented to the American Society of Engineering Educators  showed a very clear relationship between enjoyment of open ended problem solving and a cadet s desire to continue with the major   We saw it as an assessment tool of aptitude  interest  and inclination said Hardin   Eventually  all engineering becomes much more open ended  Ultimately  said Hardin and Sullivan  the goal is to have all of the department s coursework tied to time in a design studio  which would stress real world application of engineering principles from the moment 4th Class cadets begin their coursework  Bringing this concept to full fruition will require physical space  and while they consider possible solutions to the space problem  Hardin and Sullivan have proceeded to implement the idea behind the studio   The physical manifestation of the design studio may be a ways off yet  noted Sullivan   but the design studio ideas we have integrated into our curriculum are already making a difference in the way our students think about engineering  Hardin added   Kids have a tendency to compartmentalize the information by course  not seeing that it s connected  We want them to see   These are tools we want you to use  Learning mechanical engineering  the department head noted  is not unlike learning a language  Just as the ultimate goal of studying a foreign language is to be able to communicate in that language  the ultimate goal of studying engineering is to be able to solve problems with structures in the real world  And just as a language major has learned a grammar and syntax  the engineer has learned skills and concepts   I want them to understand what they have in

Skills ME Initiative Encourages Cadets to Apply Their Skills The old saying that an inventor should be able to build a better mousetrap just might be appropriate in VMI s mechanical engineering department   but instead of mousetraps  3rd Class cadets in that department are building devices to crush soda cans this year   To be a good engineer  you have to marry theory with application  said Col  Jon Michael Hardin  professor of mechanical engineering  To this end  a recent initiative in the department encourages cadets to apply their engineering skills to real world projects from the beginning of their cadetships   Engineering education can be challenging  for sure  continued Hardin  who has been teaching at VMI since 1998   But early on  I realized that what was missing from it was just how much fun engineering is   The practice of engineering is just a hoot  It s just plain fun  After becoming chair of the department in 2010  Hardin wasted little time in revamping the curriculum toward more application  and hopefully more enjoyment as well  through an experiential learning approach  By the fall of 2011  a small group of 4th Class cadets was building hovercrafts  which travel along land or water on a cushion of air  By the next year  that project was expanded to include all 4th Class mechanical engineering majors  This year s 3rd Class cadets got their first taste of hands on engineering during the hovercraft project last year  This past fall  they learned about statics  or the relationship between forces in a structure  and used their newfound knowledge to design can crushers  Now  as part of their solid mechanics class  they are working in the shop to build them   The cadets are  invested in it  said Col  Jay Sullivan  professor of mechanical engineering  who taught statics in the fall and is now teaching the solid mechanics class   It s their own design  their own analysis  The can crusher  is not a book problem  he added   It s their own problem  Likely because of this  said Hardin  the cadets have shown an interest that s truly contagious  While the cadets were designing their can crushers in the fall  he said   I would walk out into the study area and the  cadets  would say   Colonel Hardin  Colonel Hardin  come over here  Let me show you this  It s just that kind of can t stay still enthusiasm that Hardin and Sullivan want to see  Letting cadets put their engineering skills to use as early as possible  they believe  will help with retention and motivation  Last year  the department surveyed its 4th Class cadets about their like or dislike of open ended problem solving  and also their likelihood of switching majors  The results  which were presented to the American Society of Engineering Educators  showed a very clear relationship between enjoyment of open ended problem solving and a cadet s desire to continue with the major   We saw it as an assessment tool of aptitude  interest  and inclination said Hardin   Eventually  all engineering becomes much more open ended  Ultimately  said Hardin and Sullivan  the goal is to have all of the department s coursework tied to time in a design studio  which would stress real world application of engineering principles from the moment 4th Class cadets begin their coursework  Bringing this concept to full fruition will require physical space  and while they consider possible solutions to the space problem  Hardin and Sullivan have proceeded to implement the idea behind the studio   The physical manifestation of the design studio may be a ways off yet  noted Sullivan   but the design studio ideas we have integrated into our curriculum are already making a difference in the way our students think about engineering  Hardin added   Kids have a tendency to compartmentalize the information by course  not seeing that it s connected  We want them to see   These are tools we want you to use  Learning mechanical engineering  the department head noted  is not unlike learning a language  Just as the ultimate goal of studying a foreign language is to be able to communicate in that language  the ultimate goal of studying engineering is to be able to solve problems with structures in the real world  And just as a language major has learned a grammar and syntax  the engineer has learned skills and concepts   I want them to understand what they have in their toolbox  said Sullivan  By  Mary Price IR   March 2014 Engineering Division Mechanical Engineering Degrees   Programs Courses ASTM Standards ME Laboratories Cooperative Eng  Center ME Advising
