provides us a timely opportunity to discuss leadership  strategy  and international security affairs between 1981 and 1989  There are some real differences between the Cold War issues and contemporary

at the Reagan Conference General J H  Binford Peay  III  Superintendent Nov  3  2014 Distinguished guests  Cadets  students  ladies and gentlemen  welcome to the Virginia Military Institute and to this conference on leadership and national security affairs during the Reagan presidency  and on the influence of the Reagan era on today s national security issues  When this conference was first envisioned  few perhaps realized just how far current tensions between East and West would escalate  Russian actions and ambitions in Ukraine and veiled threats to a number of former Soviet Republics have us talking  once more  of an East West confrontation and give added importance to our understanding of the final years of the Cold War  This conference  titled  The Enduring Legacy  provides us a timely opportunity to discuss leadership  strategy  and international security affairs between 1981 and 1989  There are some real differences between the Cold War issues and contemporary challenges
