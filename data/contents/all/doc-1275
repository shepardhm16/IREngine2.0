Do After graduating from VMI in 1997  I found myself diving into a job and looking for a place to call home  Accepting a commission in the U S  Air Force Reserves and working as an environmental consultant was fantastic  but my soul needed somewhere to breathe  I went on with my life  spending 8 years in the Air Force Reserves and working for almost 10 years before deciding that getting my PhD was next on the list  While working on my PhD at Virginia Tech  I came across many organizations and opportunities to provide field level engineering support in developing countries  I chose to work in El Salvador and Haiti  Nothing can prepare a person for what they may see in one of these countries and no experience can really compare to Haiti  the poorest country in the western hemisphere
