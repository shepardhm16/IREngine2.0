Reports of Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Harper s Ferry  August 8  1864  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here  On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland  On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West  On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant  D  HUNTER

Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland  On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West  On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant  D  HUNTER  Major General  ADJUTANT GENERAL U S  ARMY  ADDENDA  WAR DEPARTMENT  June 14  1864 10 a m

 O R  SERIES I VOLUME XXXVII 1  S  70  MAY 26  JUNE 29  1864 The Lynchburg Campaign  No  1 Reports of Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Harper s Ferry  August 8  1864  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here  On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden

destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with

appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland  On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West  On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant  D  HUNTER  Major General  ADJUTANT GENERAL U S  ARMY  ADDENDA  WAR DEPARTMENT  June 14  1864 10 a m

Part 2 Hunter s Raid on VMI  June 1864 Union Operations Report  June 6   July 14  1864 This text is from the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies  O R  SERIES I VOLUME XXXVII 1  S  70  MAY 26  JUNE 29  1864 The Lynchburg Campaign  No  1 Reports of Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Harper s Ferry  August 8  1864  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here  On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I

we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the

VOLUME XXXVII 1  S  70  MAY 26  JUNE 29  1864 The Lynchburg Campaign  No  1 Reports of Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Harper s Ferry  August 8  1864  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here  On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained

Report  June 6   July 14  1864 This text is from the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies  O R  SERIES I VOLUME XXXVII 1  S  70  MAY 26  JUNE 29  1864 The Lynchburg Campaign  No  1 Reports of Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Harper s Ferry  August 8  1864  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here  On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland  On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West  On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant  D  HUNTER

since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a

totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland  On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West  On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant  D  HUNTER  Major General  ADJUTANT GENERAL U S  ARMY

including operations June 2 July 14  HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  Harper s Ferry  August 8  1864  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va  On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here  On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry  Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery  He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns  This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned  On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days  While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy  On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss  On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg  On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames  On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty  Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them  To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched  General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive  Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works  During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon  Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade  Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up  After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m  From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle  I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake  We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made  About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed  During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night  On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report  On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by way of Staunton and Harrisonburg  In favor of the route via Lewisburg to Charleston  Kanawha  it was urged that the road was clear and practicable  and that while the country would furnish little or nothing in the way of supplies  yet we had ample stores at Meadow Bluff and Gauley River  As the question of supplies was one that involved the existence of the army the Kanawha route was decided upon  and messengers immediately sent forward to have supplies sent out from these points to meet the troops  On the night of the 24th we rested at the Greenbrier White Sulphur Springs  From this point I ordered a regiment of cavalry to follow the supply train going toward Beverly  and assist Colonel Putnam in its defense if necessary  On the 25th passed through Lewisburg and halted in the evening near Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge  On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command  Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked  Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland  On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West  On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant  D  HUNTER  Major General  ADJUTANT GENERAL U S  ARMY

Campaign  No  1 Reports of Maj  Gen  David Hunter  U S  Army  commanding Department of West Virginia  including operations June 2 July 14 Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies   HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA  GENERAL  I have the honor to submit the following report of operations in this department since my last  of date June 8  forwarded from Staunton  Va my last On the day after the defeat of Jones at Piedmont  I marched on Staunton  June 6  and occupied the town without opposition  the enemy  with the shattered remnant of his army  having retreated to Waynesboro and Rockfish Gap  in the Blue Ridge  ready to fall back on Charlottesville and Gordonsville if pursued  At Staunton I destroyed a large amount of public stores  consisting of shoes  saddles  harness  and clothing  3 cannon and about 1 000 stand of small arms  also several extensive establishments for the manufacture of army clothing and equipments  I also had the Virginia Central Railroad entirely destroyed for several miles east and west of the town  burning all the depot buildings  shops  and warehouses belonging to the road  About 500 prisoners  for the most part wounded and invalids  fell into our hands here On the 8th I was joined by the forces under Generals Crook and Averell  about 10 000 men  with two batteries  This command  returning from a successful raid on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad and moving to join me at Staunton  had struck the line of the Virginia Central at Goshen and had totally destroyed this road as they marched to the point of junction  making in all a total destruction of the road for a distance of fifty miles  From this point I sent back by way of Buffalo Gap and Beverly a convoy of wagons  prisoners  and refugees  guarded by 800 men whose term of enlistment had expired  the whole under the command of Col  A  Moor  of the Twenty eighth Ohio Volunteer Infantry Having rested and reorganized the combined forces under my command I started on the 10th toward Lexington  moving up the Valley in four columns by roads nearly parallel  The infantry division under General Crook  and the cavalry division under General Averell  moving on the right hand road  were opposed by McCausland  with about 2 000 mounted men and a battery He was easily driven  however  and on the 11th took refuge in the town of Lexington  behind the North River  a tributary of the James  Generals Crook and Averell arriving about midday on the 11th  found the bridge across this stream burnt  and the crossing disputed by sharpshooters and artillery  The infantry division under General Sullivan  which moved on the road to the left  and which I accompanied in person  had met with no enemy thus far  but at the sound of Crook s guns moved rapidly forward and took position in front of the town  I found the enemy s sharpshooters posted among the rocks and thickets of the opposite cliffs and in some store houses at the bridge  and also occupying the buildings of the Virginia Military Institute  which stood near the river  Their artillery was screened behind the buildings of the town  and on some heights just beyond it the whole position was completely commanded by my artillery  thirty guns This unsoldierly and inhuman attempt of General McCausland to defend an indefensible position against an overwhelming force by screening himself behind the private dwellings of women and children  might have brought justifiable destruction upon the whole town  but as this was not rendered imperative by any military necessity  I preferred to spare private property and an unarmed population  Instead of crushing the place with my artillery  I sent General Averell with a brigade of cavalry to cross the river some distance  and fall upon the enemy s flank and rear  Before this movement was completed  the enemy perceived it and hastily retired on the road toward Buchanan  The battalion of Cadets  about 250 muskets  took part in the defense and retired by the Balcony Fails road toward Lynchburg  I was told that Colonel Smith  principal of the Institute  and commanding the Cadets  protested against the attempted defense as entirely futile  purposeless  and unnecessarily exposing the town and its helpless inhabitants to danger and destruction  In occupying this place a few prisoners were taken  5 pieces of cannon  with numerous caissons and gun carriages  some small arms  and a quantity of ammunition fell into our hands and were destroyed  6 barges laden with commissary stores  artillery ammunition  and 6 pieces of cannon were captured and destroyed on the James River Canal near the town  A number of extensive iron works in the vicinity were burned On the 12th I also burned the Virginia Military Institute and all the buildings connected with it  I found here a violent and inflammatory proclamation from John Letcher  lately Governor of Virginia  inciting the population of the country to rise and wage a guerrilla warfare on my troops  and ascertaining that after having advised his fellow citizens to this course the ex Governor had himself ignominiously taken to flight  I ordered his property to be burned under my order  published May 24  against persons practicing or abetting such unlawful and uncivilized warfare  Having had information that a train of 200 wagons  loaded with supplies and guarded by two regiments of infantry  was en route following our march  I delayed one day in Lexington to allow it time to overtake us  I had also begun to feel anxious in regard to Duffi  from whom I had not definitely heard for two days While awaiting news from Duffi  on the 13th I sent Averell forward to Buchanan with orders to drive McCausland out of the way and  if possible  secure the bridge over the James River at that place  Before starting General Averell detached a party of 200 picked men  with orders to ride around Lynchburg  cutting the railroad communication and obtaining all possible information of the enemy On the afternoon of the 13th General Duffi  arrived and made a report of his operations in person  On the 10th he had moved from Staunton simultaneously with the other columns  A regiment sent to demonstrate toward Waynesboro drove the enemy through that place and then followed the division by the road running southward along the western base of the Blue Ridge  Driving a small force from White s Gap  General Duffi  crossed the ridge and came upon the Charlottesville and Lynchburg railroad  menacing Lynchburg from the vicinity of Amherst Court House  and breaking the road at Arrington Station  He was followed from Waynesboro by a large mounted force under Imboden  who  however  never hazarded a general attack  and who was signally defeated in every attempt to harass or impede the movements of our troops  In addition to the damage done to the railroad  General Duffi  captured 100 prisoners  about 500 horses  and destroyed large quantities of stores and a considerable portion of Imboden s train  He returned by Tye River Gap  without serious loss On this day I received positive information from a scout that Breckinridge was in command of the rebel forces at Rockfish Gap  while from prisoners and others we had rumors that a formidable rebel force was hastening toward the Valley from Richmond  and that Sheridan had met with a reverse near Louisa Court House  At the same time I had assurance that there was no considerable force of the enemy in or near Lynchburg On the morning of the 14th I moved with my whole command toward Buchanan  and on arriving there found it occupied by Averell  He had driven McCausland sharply from the place  capturing some prisoners and a number of canal barges laden with stores  but had not succeeded in saving the bridge  As there was a convenient and accessible ford at hand the advance of the army was not retarded by its loss  In view of this fact and of the danger incurred to private property the inhabitants of the village protested against the burning of the bridge  but McCausland  with his characteristic recklessness  persisted in the needless destruction  involving eleven private dwellings in the conflagration  The farther progress of this needless devastation was stopped by the friendly efforts of our troops  who extinguished the flames On the 15th I moved from Buchanan  crossing the Blue Ridge by the Peaks of Otter road  This road was blockaded by felled trees  and our advance feebly contested by some light parties of the enemy  It was  however  easily cleared  and on the evening of the same day my cavalry occupied Liberty  the county town of Bedford  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  twenty four miles from Lynchburg  At this point the detachment of picked men  200  which had been sent out by General Averell from Lexington to make the circuit of Lynchburg  reported  having accomplished their perilous undertaking with trifling loss  Moving eastward from Lexington they crossed the Blue Ridge and struck the Charlottesville railroad near Amherst Court House  tearing up the track for a short distance  Thence moving southeastward they crossed the James River below Lynchburg  destroying the South Side Railroad for a short distance  and burning two trains at Concordia Station  from thence making a circuit within a few miles of Lynchburg they turned westward  meeting the advance of the main army at Liberty Neither from this scouting party nor from other sources could we obtain any clear or reliable information in regard to the enemy  Through rebel channels we had exaggerated rumors of disasters to our armies both under Sherman and Grant  Some reported that Sheridan had been defeated near Louisa Court House  while others said that he was already in Lynchburg  Negro refugees just from the town represented that it was occupied only by a few thousand armed invalids and militia  and that its inhabitants in the greatest panic were fleeing with their movable property by every available route  At the same time  from other sources equally worthy of respect  we were assured that all the rebel forces of West Virginia were concentrated there under Breckinridge  and that Ewell s corps of veteran troops  20 000 strong  had already re enforced them To develop the truth I determined to advance on Lynchburg immediately  Early on the 16th General Duffi  moved with his cavalry on the Forestville road  sending a strong reconnaissance toward Balcony Falls to ascertain the truth of a report which located a considerable force of the enemy at that point  General Crook s division of infantry moved by the railroad  destroying it effectually as they marched General Averell led the advance on the Bedford turnpike  followed by Sullivan s infantry  the reserve artillery  and the baggage train  General Averell continued to drive McCausland before him  but in the afternoon reported that the enemy had been re enforced  and was becoming stubborn  Encamped at night near the Bedford turnpike  seven miles east of Liberty  my cavalry advance near the Great Otter River  From this point I sent back the supply train of 200 wagons which had overtaken us at Lexington  Colonel Putnam  with his regiment of Ohio 100 days  volunteers  was detailed to guard it  and the train put under the direction of Captain McCann  assistant quartermaster  This train was accompanied by a large number of loyal refugees  both whites and negroes  and the route proposed for its return to our lines was by way of New Castle  Sweet Springs  Lewisburg  and Charleston  Kanawha  During the night received information from General Averell that he had had a sharp contest with the enemy at New London and had driven him  but that he had evidently been re enforced and was becoming aggressive Early in the morning of the 17th orders were given for the troops to move  but the march was delayed for several hours at the Great Otter River  owing to the difficulty in crossing the artillery  and in consequence we did not overtake the enemy until 4 o clock in the afternoon  At that hour Averell s advance came upon the enemy  strongly posted and entrenched at Diamond Hill  five miles from Lynchburg  He immediately attacked  and a sharp contest ensued  Crook s infantry arriving at the same time  made a brilliant advance upon the enemy  drove him from his works back upon the town  killing and wounding a number and capturing 70 men and 1 gun  It being too late to follow up this success  we encamped upon the battle field  The best information to be obtained at this point of the enemy s forces and plans indicated that all the rebel forces heretofore operating in the Valley and West Virginia were concentrated in Lynchburg  under the command of General Breckinridge  This force was variously estimated at from 10 000 to 15 000 men  well supplied with artillery  and protected by strong works During the night the trains on the different railroads were heard running without intermission  while repeated cheers and the beating of drums indicated the arrival of large bodies of troops in the town  yet up to the morning of the 18th I had no positive information as to whether General Lee had detached any considerable force for the relief of Lynchburg  To settle the question on this morning  I advanced my skirmishers as far as the toll gate on the Bedford road  two miles from the town  and a brisk fire was opened between them and the enemy behind their works  This skirmishing with musketry  occasionally assisted by the artillery  was kept up during the whole of the forenoon Their works consisted of strong redoubts on each of the main roads entering the town about three miles apart  flanked on either side by rifle pits protected by abatis  On these lines the enemy could be seen working diligently as if to extend and strengthen them  I massed my two divisions of infantry in front of the works on the Bedford road ready to move to the right or left as required  the artillery in commanding positions  and Averell s cavalry division in reserve  Duffi  was ordered to attack resolutely on the Forestville road  our extreme left  while Averell sent two squadrons of cavalry to demonstrate against the Campbell Court House road on our extreme right  This detachment was subsequently strengthened by a brigade Meanwhile I reconnoitered the lines  hoping to find a weak interval through which I might push with my infantry  passing between the main redoubts  which appeared too strong for a direct assault  While the guns were sounding on the two flanks  the enemy  no doubt  supposing my center weakened by too great extension of my lines  and hoping to cut us in two  suddenly advanced in great force from his works  and commenced a most determined attack on my position on the Bedford turnpike  Although his movement was so unexpected and rapid as almost to amount to a surprise  yet it was promptly and gallantly met by Sullivan s division  which held the enemy in check until Crook was enabled to get his troops up After a fierce contest of half an hour s duration  the enemy s direct attack was repulsed  but he persistently renewed the fight  making repeated attempts to flank us on the left and to push between my main body and Duffi s division  In this effort he was completely foiled  and at the end of an hour and twenty minutes was routed and driven back into his works in disorder and with heavy loss  In the eagerness of pursuit  one regiment  One hundred and sixteenth Ohio entered the works on the heels of the flying enemy  but being unsupported  fell back with trifling loss  Our whole loss in this action was comparatively light  The infantry behaved with the greatest steadiness  and the artillery  which materially assisted in repelling the attack  was served with remarkable rapidity and efficiency  This affair closed about 2 p m From prisoners captured we obtained positive information that a portion of Ewell s corps was engaged in the action  and that the whole corps  20 000 strong  under the command of Lieutenant General Early  was either already in Lynchburg or near a  hand  The detachment sent by General Averell to operate on our right had returned  reporting that they had encountered a large body of rebel cavalry in that quarter  while Duffi  although holding his position  sent word that he was pressed by a superior force  It had now become sufficiently evident that the enemy had concentrated a force of at least double the numerical strength of mine  and what added to the gravity of the situation was the fact that my troops had scarcely enough of ammunition left to sustain another well contested battle I immediately ordered all the baggage and supply trains to retire by the Bedford turnpike  and made preparations to withdraw the army as soon as it should become sufficiently dark to conceal the movement from the enemy  Meanwhile  as there still remained five hours of daylight  they were ordered to maintain a firm front  and with skirmishers to press the enemy s lines at all points  I have since learned that Early s whole force was up in time to have made a general attack on the same afternoon  18th an attack which under the circumstances would probably have been fatal to us but rendered cautious by the bloody repulse of Breckinridge  and deceived by the firm attitude of my command  he devoted the afternoon to refreshment and repose  expecting to strike a decisive blow on the following morning  As soon as it became dark I quietly withdrew my whole force  leaving a line of pickets close to the enemy  with orders to remain until 12 o clock  midnight  and then follow the main body  This was successfully accomplished without loss of men or material  excepting only a few wounded who were left in a temporary hospital by mistake We bivouacked that night at a point seven miles east of Liberty  and the following day  19th  at our leisure  moved toward Buford s Gap  occupying the town of Liberty until late in the afternoon unmolested by the enemy  who in all probability had not suspected the movement until daylight  About 4 p m  the rear guard under Averell was attacked by the enemy s advance of cavalry and mounted men and driven  after a spirited action  through the town and back on my main body  The infantry prepared to receive the enemy in position about one mile west of Liberty  but no attack was made About midnight we resumed  our march and next morning  20th  entered Buford s Gap  General Duffi  who had gone forward to take possession of this passage through the Blue Ridge  found it disputed by a small body of the enemy  which he swept out of his way with little difficulty  The march was continued to Bonsack s Station  on the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad  destroying bridges  water tanks  and depot buildings on that road as we moved  The enemy coming up to our rear guard on the afternoon of this day made some feeble demonstration  but was easily repulsed During the night our march was continued to Salem  destroying all the bridges  contents  and depot buildings on the railroad  We arrived at Salem about sunrise on the 21st  About 9 a m  the enemy made a demonstration against our rear guard  While opposing his advance in that direction our baggage train and reserve artillery were sent off by the New Castle road  and through some inadvertence the proper guard did not accompany the artillery  While our attention was directed to the rear of the column a detachment of the enemy s cavalry fell upon the artillery en route and got possession of two batteries  spiking the guns  disabling the carriages  and carrying off the horses  They were presently driven off by our cavalry  losing some 30 men  killed  wounded  and prisoners  and the guns were recaptured  Owing to the loss of horses and the breaking of the carriages we were obliged to abandon 8 pieces with their limbers and caissons  after burning all their carriages  From Salem the enemy s cavalry followed us to Catawba Valley  where we rested that night On the following morning his advance was ambuscaded and roughly handled  and from that date the army pursued its course unmolested  On the night of the 22d we rested at New Castle  At this place I was informed that Early was concentrating his forces at Salem  Our scouts also brought reports that the enemy in large force was moving between us and the White Sulphur Springs  Cavalry reconnaissances toward Fincastle  Covington  and Sweet Springs failed to discover any trace of an enemy in force or any grounds for the report On the 23d moved from New Castle to the Sweet Springs  On account of the difficulties of the road and the intense heat of the day we lost a good many horses on this march  At the Sweet Springs I ascertained that the supply train and convoy under Colonel Putnam had been attacked by guerrillas  led by one Thurmond  and that it had turned aside from the Lewisburg route and had taken the road to Beverly  From this point it was suggested that we should move northward by the Warm Springs and the Valley of the South Branch of Potomac  a route lying west of and running parallel to the Valley of the Shenandoah  By this route the army would have reached the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at New Creek and Cumberland  It was objected that by this road the troops would find it impossible to collect necessary supplies and run risks of being cut off by the enemy coming in by

Meadow Bluff  I ascertained that the officer left in command at this post with 400 men had become alarmed at some demonstrations by guerrillas  and had  with baggage and supplies  fallen back to Gauley Bridge On the 27th  between Meadow Bluff and Gauley  met the supply train with 70 000 rations for the troops  they arrived in good time to prevent suffering  and their appearance was greeted by hearty cheers  Halted for the night near Gauley Bridge  Remained here on the 28th and 29th  allowing time for stragglers to come up and to refresh and organize the command Arrived at Charleston  Kanawha  on the 30th June  and remained until July 3  reorganizing and refitting the troops  and gathering up steamers to transport the army by water to Parkersburg  Feeling assured that the enemy would take advantage of the absence of these troops to make some demonstrations in the Valley  every nerve was strained to hasten their movement  But the obstacles were for a time insurmountable  After their recent fatigues neither men nor animals were in any condition for a farther march  and the excessive heat of the weather would have rendered such an attempt ruinous to the army  Transportation by water  if practicable  would save time  and rest the men and horses  Yet  on account of the long drought  the Ohio River was reported to be so low as to be impassable to the smallest boats  nevertheless  all the light draught boats that could be found were seized and the troops embarked Arriving at Parkersburg on the afternoon of July 4  I received information that the enemy had appeared in force in the Valley  had driven Sigel out of Martinsburg  and were demonstrating against our railroad guards at several points west  The movement of the troops by the river route was pressed forward with the utmost diligence and zeal  yet the difficulties were even greater than at first appeared  The men had to be disembarked at the Shallows and marched around  at other points the boats could not pass  even when thus lightened  and small boats above the bars received and transported the men to other points  where they were in their turn obliged to stop  In this way the troops got in slowly  but withal sooner and in better condition than if they had attempted to march by land  The baggage trains and cavalry came to Parkersburg by the land route  At this place I remained until July 8 superintending and hastening the transportation of the troops by rail to New Creek and Cumberland On the night of the 8th took the cars for Cumberland and arrived there on the morning of the 9th at 10 a m  Reports from various sources indicated that the enemy was in Maryland with the greater part of his force moving toward the Monocacy  Imboden s attempts on the railroad at Sir John s and at South Branch and Patterson s Creek had been repulsed  and Sullivan  occupying Hedgesville with infantry and cavalry  reported no enemy visible in the Shenandoah Valley  On the 10th Sullivan occupied Martinsburg with his cavalry  Remained in Cumberland until the 14th of July pressing forward the troops  who continued to arrive slowly from the West On the 14th took cars on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad  reaching Martinsburg about midday  At this place General Sigel reported in person with a detailed account of his operations and the military situation  Reached Harper s Ferry on horseback the same night  I have the honor to be  very respectfully  your most obedient servant D  HUNTER  Major General  ADJUTANT GENERAL U S  ARMY  ADDENDA  WAR DEPARTMENT  June 14  1864 10 a m
