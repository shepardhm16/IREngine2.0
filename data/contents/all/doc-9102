Autonomous Tick Collecting Robot by Justin Woulfe  Barry Hammond  and Dennis Crump  06 Ticks are a heath hazard  they infest our pets and vector human diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever and Lyme disease  We propose a robotics based solution to reduce tick populations  The ecotone  a fifteen foot wide swath defining the boundary between cultivated lawn and woods  is the ticks  natural habitat  A flexible perforated tube is routed around the ecotone that emits a chemoattractant such as carbon dioxide  drawing ticks from the ecotone into a narrowly defined path  A robot is programmed to travel around this path collecting and exposing ticks to promethren  a common insecticide  The chemoattractant tube also houses a signal wire that the robot follows using inductive sensors to navigate the path  sweeping the entire ecotone  Sensor information is relayed to a microcontroller which  using a fuzzy logic algorithm  keeps the robot directly over the tube and the attracted ticks  The robot stops every lap in a specially designed shed to be recharged  cleaned  and UV sterilized  If continued for three months  the ticks  life cycle will be broken leaving the protected area tick free for years  Simple modifications permit the system to target other pests  such as aphids  termites  and cockroaches  The students earned an undergraduate research grant to fund development  and wrote a paper on the device which won first place in the Virginia Mountain Section of the annual IEEE Student Papers Contest  and then won second place in the IEEE Region 3 contest   one of the 6 regions in the country  The device was co advised by James Squire and David Livingston from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at VMI  Jay Sullivan from the Department of Mechanical Engineering at VMI  and Daniel Sonenshine from the Department of Biology at Old Dominion University  The device is patented naming the students and their advisors as inventors  and the intellectual property is currently being marketed  View videos of it on the Discovery Channel and WSLS by going here and choosing  Popular Media TV Radio  Back
