biology  including plant and animal biology  conservation  and ecology  The program also is intended to promote hands on experiences through undergraduate research  internships in related fields  or immersion in a designated intensive field oriented class  The ECOS option does not affect the credit hours required for the B S  or B A  in biology  however  14 credit hours must be obtained from the
