Birdsong Cadet Sarah Hunziker  13 spent last summer recording and cataloging the songs of tree swallows in an effort to understand the meanings behind their vocalizations    The research was conducted under the mentorship of biology professor Col  Dick Rowe and sponsored by the Swope Summer Scholars Program  which consists of eight weeks of intensive research  Hunziker  who is considering graduate studies in marine biology  is currently completing the analysis of the birdsongs for her capstone project   I know that if I go to graduate school  field research is something I m very interested in doing  said Hunziker   It was a really good experience and was really eye opening to what my life could be like for the next few years  The research was conducted at the biology department s new field site at the Sky Farm area in McKethan Park  where birdhouses were set in the spring to attract the migrating tree swallows  The tree swallows were present by the summer  and a high sensitivity microphone was used to record the swallows  songs   We were trying to get as close as we could to the birds in order to isolate just one bird and record its vocalizations  said Rowe   By paying attention to what the birds were doing when they were vocalizing  we can start to understand what those songs mean  All of those calls were carefully cataloged along with the various contexts in which they were made   I took extensive field notes  and the recorders allow you to mark different parts of the tape  said Hunziker   I could mark the tape and then say in my notes  I was x amount of feet from the nest box and they were dive bombing me and the recorder  so I would pair up the recordings with the context  By documenting the context along with the recordings  researchers can begin to identify meaning behind the songs  Using sound analysis software helped to visualize and quantify minute differences in the calls   There s a huge amount of information in these calls  It s very subtle  and that s where the software comes in  said Rowe  By comparing tiny differences in the duration  amplitude  and pauses  researchers can find and quantify variations in the songs that may not be readily noticeable by the human ear   We can look at it like a sentence  notes are like letters  syllables are like words  and a song is like a sentence  said Rowe   We suspect that there are some really complicated things going on  To get the best data  research was conducted at sunrise  when the birds are most active  Since the site was so close to post  four or five trips a week were possible for the entirety of the two month research period  All that time in the field created a mountain of data to be analyzed   For every minute you spend in the field there are ten or so on the computer  playing it back  sorting through it  and cutting out background noise and other birds that I don t need  said Hunziker  From those hours of recording  Hunziker isolated what she suspected were alarm calls and strung them together in one recording  Playing that recording back to the swallows triggered aggressive flight patterns   Within 30 seconds we had tree swallows circling and diving at the tape recorder trying to figure out where the threat was  said Rowe   It was very clear that this was an alarm call and that there was some kind of recruitment piece in there  Now that the alarm calls have been identified and documented  the next round of research will seek to determine what kind of information is contained within those alarm calls  Recent research has established that the alarm calls of both mammals and birds are referential  that is  they are able to convey information about the nature of the threat  Referential alarm calls refer to types of threats and will differ depending on the predator that triggered the calls  These referential calls are opposed to risk based calls  which simply relate to the proximity or intensity of the threat   It s possible that tree swallows just have risk based alarm calls  said Rowe   On the other hand  they may be saying  we have a snake  we have an owl  or we have a bluebird problem  Future research projects on this subject would seek to determine whether tree swallow calls are referential by setting up scenarios and monitoring the birds  responses   If they give a certain call in response to a hawk  and we play that song back to them in the absence of a hawk  do they act as if a hawk is around  said Rowe   So you have to set up behavioral scenarios to correlate behaviors with a song  The migratory swallows

Meaning in Birdsong Research Project Finds Meaning in Birdsong Cadet Sarah Hunziker  13 spent last summer recording and cataloging the songs of tree swallows in an effort to understand the meanings behind their vocalizations    The research was conducted under the mentorship of biology professor Col  Dick Rowe and sponsored by the Swope Summer Scholars Program  which consists of eight weeks of intensive research  Hunziker  who is considering graduate studies in marine biology  is currently completing the analysis of the birdsongs for her capstone project   I know that if I go to graduate school  field research is something I m very interested in doing  said Hunziker   It was a really good experience and was really eye opening to what my life could be like for the next few years  The research was conducted at the biology department s new field site at the Sky Farm area in McKethan Park  where birdhouses were set in the spring to attract the migrating tree swallows  The tree swallows were present by the summer  and a high sensitivity microphone was used to record the swallows  songs   We were trying to get as close as we could to the birds in order to isolate just one bird and record its vocalizations  said Rowe   By paying attention to what the birds were doing when they were vocalizing  we can start to understand what those songs mean  All of those calls were carefully cataloged along with the various contexts in which they were made   I took extensive field notes  and the recorders allow you to mark different parts of the tape  said Hunziker   I could mark the tape and then say in my notes  I was x amount of feet from the nest box and they were dive bombing me and the recorder  so I would pair up the recordings with the context  By documenting the context along with the recordings  researchers can begin to identify meaning behind the songs  Using sound analysis software helped to visualize and quantify minute differences in the calls   There s a huge amount of information in these calls  It s very subtle  and that s where the software comes in  said Rowe  By comparing tiny differences in the duration  amplitude  and pauses  researchers can find and quantify variations in the songs that may not be readily noticeable by the human ear   We can look at it like a sentence  notes are like letters  syllables are like words  and a song is like a sentence  said Rowe   We suspect that there are some really complicated things going on  To get the best data  research was conducted at sunrise  when the birds are most active  Since the site was so close to post  four or five trips a week were possible for the entirety of the two month research period  All that time in the field created a mountain of data to be analyzed   For every minute you spend in the field there are ten or so on the computer  playing it back  sorting through it  and cutting out background noise and other birds that I don t need  said Hunziker  From those hours of recording  Hunziker isolated what she suspected were alarm calls and strung them together in one recording  Playing that recording back to the swallows triggered aggressive flight patterns   Within 30 seconds we had tree swallows circling and diving at the tape recorder trying to figure out where the threat was  said Rowe   It was very clear that this was an alarm call and that there was some kind of recruitment piece in there  Now that the alarm calls have been identified and documented  the next round of research will seek to determine what kind of information is contained within those alarm calls  Recent research has established that the alarm calls of both mammals and birds are referential  that is  they are able to convey information about the nature of the threat  Referential alarm calls refer to types of threats and will differ depending on the predator that triggered the calls  These referential calls are opposed to risk based calls  which simply relate to the proximity or intensity of the threat   It s possible that tree swallows just have risk based alarm calls  said Rowe   On the other hand  they may be saying  we have a snake  we have an owl  or we have a bluebird problem  Future research projects on this subject would seek to determine whether tree swallow calls are referential by setting up scenarios and monitoring the birds  responses   If they give a certain call in response to a hawk  and we play that song back to them in the absence of a hawk  do they act as if a hawk is around  said Rowe   So you have to set up behavioral scenarios to correlate behaviors with a song  The migratory swallows have now vacated McKethan Park for the winter but are expected back in time for next summer s research  By   John Robertson IV  IR   Dec  2012 Life
