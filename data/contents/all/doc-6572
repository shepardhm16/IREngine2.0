Psychology Research Suggests It s True Facebook helps people connect with friends and is perceived as a fun diversion  However  according to research conducted by Lt  Col  Scott Frein and cadets in the psychology department  it is actually impairing memory and making users less happy   My primary interest in research is the effects of writing intervention on physical and psychological well being  said Frein  In his cognition class  he covers studies that have shown excessive electronic media use   television  computers  and video games   is correlated with ADHD  Over the past few years  cadets in his classes have shown an interest in discovering how this applies specifically to Facebook  Samantha Jones  12 approached him about studying the effects of Facebook use on cadets  This would eventually become her Summer Undergraduate Research Institute project in 2011  Cadets participating in the study were divided into two groups   heavy Facebook users   those on Facebook for an hour or more per day   and those who used Facebook for less than an hour  They were then given a memory test in which they were shown words they were to remember and then given a distractor task   in this case  math problems   for one minute   Heavy Facebook users did significantly worse on the memory test    and honestly I was really surprised by this  Frein said  When the distractor task was increased from one minute to five minutes  there was an even steeper drop in heavy Facebook users  recall  There was no difference in the group with low Facebook usage  This research was advanced by Tyler Cross  14 in the fall of 2013 when heavy Facebook users were compared to those who reported heavy YouTube or general Internet usage  Again  heavy Facebook users did much worse on memory tests  while general Internet usage showed virtually no effect on memory  The problem with this type of research is that it really cannot tell why this is happening  only that there is a correlation between Facebook usage and memory  Nevertheless  Frein has a few ideas on the uniqueness of Facebook   We re teaching people to focus on very small amounts of information for very short times as they go from post to post    the more you use Facebook  the more you re training yourself that  I don t have to remember this stuff  he said   They are becoming less and less efficient at remembering information because they re out of practice  In addition to memory impairment  another study by Patrick Goulden  13 in the summer and fall of 2012 sought to discover the correlation between Facebook usage and overall happiness  For this study  cadets were again divided into two groups   they sat in a room and either checked their Facebook for 30 minutes or they sat in a room and talked to one of their friends for 30 minutes   The people that used Facebook for 30 minutes showed a significant drop in their level of positive emotions  explained Frein   Those that were in the talking group reported less stress  and  anxiety and an increase in self esteem  To gauge this  cadets were surveyed about how they were feeling before and after the 30 minute sessions  Frein hypothesizes that the reason cadets felt worse after checking their Facebook is the  positivity bias  that exists on the website  Users generally only post the good events and news in their lives  and other users compare their lives to these seemingly perfect standards  Despite the negative emotions brought on by Facebook  when given the choice  cadets participating in the study almost always chose the scenario that would let them check their Facebook for 30 minutes  When he has visited other college campuses  Frein has observed that this is not unique to VMI   When I was in college  it was loud between classes   people were talking  he said   Now I see large groups of students walking in total silence as they re all on their phones or iPads  We re losing those face to face interactions which make people happier and feel better about themselves   I understand the logic    I m feeling down so I want to connect with my friends because they make me feel better  but the asynchronous timing in the connection is not producing the results people want  he said  Frein and his cadet researchers have received positive feedback when presenting the results of their research at conferences the past few years  Jones and Cross went to the national convention of the Association of Psychological Science  while Goulden presented at the Virginia Social Science Association  Their findings have also been published in Computers in Human Behavior  If there is one take away from these studies  Frein hopes it is an increased awareness of the power of face to face conversation in a world that is becoming more and more reliant on electronic communication   If you have a few free minutes  have a conversation with somebody  he concluded  By  Daniel Stinnett  07 IR   Oct  2014   VMI Foundation Keydet Club
