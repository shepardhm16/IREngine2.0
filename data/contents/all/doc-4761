USDA ARS  Corvallis  Oregon  and Dee Denver  Oregon State U  was published in PLoSOne  Using Mitogenomic and Nuclear Ribosomal Sequence Data to Investigate the Phylogeny of the Xiphinema americanum Species Complex    PHOTO  Peter Mullin Ontologies Workshop at NESCent I spent the week of July 29  August 2  2013 at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center attending the Ontologies for Evolutionary Biology workshop  Ontologies are controlled  relational vocabularies that can be used to organize biological data so it can be easily searched and linked to other data  I am interested in extending what s already been done for the C  elegans anatomy ontology to include the diversity of other nematodes  American Society of Parasitologists meeting In late June  2013 I attended the American Society of Parasitologists meeting in Quebec City  Canada  I presented some research done collaboratively with one of my undergraduate students  Kristin Forgrave  12  and colleagues at U  Mass  Lowell and U  New Hampshire    Ecology  Taxonomy  and Evolution of the Chaetogaster limnaei  Oligochaeta  Annelida  Species Complex  I also managed to finally get a picture with both my graduate school mentors  Bill Font  masters  and Steve Nadler  Ph D    two people who have made a huge and positive impact on my life  Bill Font  Ashleigh Smythe  and Steve Nadler at the 2013 ASP meeting in Quebec City  Canada  Smythe lab students present their research In April  2013 I took my three senior research students to present their research to the Helminthological Society of Washington meeting at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania  HelmSoc is the oldest parasitology research society in America  Rebecca Knipp  13 gave a talk titled  Oxyurid nematodes from the Madagascar Hissing Cockroach  Gromphadorhina portentosa  Ethan Ayres  13 presented  Helminth parasites of the American mink  Neovison vison  from central New York state  and Matt Combs  13 presented  Testing the Hygiene Hypothesis  Heligmosomoides bakeri as potential preventative for multiple low dose streptozotocin induced insulitis in mice  They all did a super job on their talks  and Matt even won the best student paper competition  Smythe lab at the spring HelmSoc meeting  L to R  Matt Combs  13  Ethan Ayeres  13  Ashleigh Smythe  and Rebecca Knipp  13  PHOTO  Maria Roberts Scenes from Parasitology  Spring 2013

I joined three other meiofauna researchers  Rick Hochberg and his student Sarah Atherton of U  Massachusetts  Lowell  and Julian Smith of Winthrop University  Rick s NSF grant to study gastrotrichs provided the funding for the trip  and luckily Rick invited Julian and me along to study our own animals that also live in the sand   nematodes for me and flatworms for Julian  More pictures coming soon  Summer Student Research This summer  2012  three Hamilton College students have been hard at work in my lab for a few weeks now  Rebecca Knipp  13  Doug Santoro  14 and Ethan Ayres  13  Ethan has been focusing on helminth parasites of mink  provided by local trappers  Rebecca and Doug have been working to collect and identify predatory soil nematodes of the order Mononchida  Doug is also doing some work on soil nematodes from invasive garlic mustard habitats  and Rebecca is getting started on a project involving nematodes from the Madagascar hissing cockroach  Field work in Panama I recently returned from 2 weeks collecting marine nematodes on the Pacific coast of Panama in December  2011  I joined 9 other researchers studying meiofauna  tiny animals found in sediment  Working out of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute s Naos Laboratory in Panama City  we collected in nearby coastal habitats as well as islands offshore  including Las Perlas archipelago and Isla Taboga  This was the third collecting trip for this meiofauna team  led by John Norenburg of the Smithsonian s NMNH  and our long run goal is to compare the diversity we find in Pacific Panama to that of the Caribbean side and our site in Belize  Carrie Bow Cay  The classic biogeographic trans isthmus comparison has never been made with meiofauna  and we think these understudied little animals are a great way to explore patterns of diversity and evolution  Summer Student Field Parasitology Research Five Hamilton students have been hard at work in the lab for the past few weeks  studying the ecology of a variety of parasites  Kristin Forgrave has been working on a project  now joint with Rick Hochberg at U  Mass  Lowell  to understand the relationship between the ectoparasitic and endoparasitic forms of the oligochaete Chaetogaster limnaei  associates of physid snails  Chris Kline and JJ Liebow have been exploring larval trematodes in physid snails  using DNA to identify taxa that we find as adults in muskrats  Jackie Specht and Abby Koppa are working to understand the ecological distribution of a new species of nematode found in the branchial chamber of crayfish  Jackie  Chris  and Kristin will continue their research this fall as senior thesis projects  Left to right  Chris Kline  Abby Koppa  Jackie Specht  Ashleigh Smythe  Kristin Forgrave and JJ Liebow at Nick s

invited to speak in a symposium titled  Freshwater and Marine Nematodes  My talk was titled  Molecular Phylogeny of Enoplia  Implications for Classification and Stoma Evolution  This project seeks to understand the evolutionary relationships and morphological evolution of a group of marine nematodes  the Enoplia  Enoplid nematodes are evolutionarily important as they may represent the earliest lineage of all nematodes  and understanding their evolution improves our understanding of the entire phylum  including important human  animal and plant parasites  Enoplids also display a wide variety of morphological features of the mouth region  including adaptations for predatory  algal  and bacterial feeding  and my work aims to understand the evolution of these morphologies  The marine enoplid nematode Epacanthion sp  PHOTO  Ashleigh Smythe International Congress on Invertebrate Morphology June 20th through the 23rd  2011  I attended the 2nd International Congresss on Invertebrate Morphology at Harvard University  I gave an invited talk in a symposium titled  Meiofauna   Comparative Morphology and Evolution  There were about 250 invertebrate zoologists in attendance  mostly from Europe and North America  all with interests in the evolution and morphology of a variety of inverts  from worms to snails to crustaceans and on and on  It was a great chance to talk to loads of interesting and smart folks about invertebrate animals  the latest techniques  etc    very fun  Participants in the 2nd ICIM at Harvard University  What s that vertebrate doing there  PHOTO  Gonzolo Giribet Field work on Bay of Fundy In mid June  2011 I joined fellow meiobenthologists Fernando Pardos  Kevin Kocot  and Chris Laumer for a few days of sampling meiofauna animals in the Bay of Fundy region in  downeast  Maine  The large tides of the Bay of Fundy allow sampling of rarely exposed sediment  and I was able to collect a number of nematode taxa for phylogenetic work  Kevin and I also enjoyed a mud flat adventure finding lots of hemichordates  acorn worms  Saccoglossus kowalevskii  as well as a single priapulid  penis worm  Priapulus caudatus  after several hours of digging in the mud  Beaver necropsy Parasitology student Ethan Ayres found a road kill beaver near his hometown of Cooperstown  NY in late May  2011  He asked if he could examine it for parasites   just for fun  Yeah  that s my kind of fun  He found a great trichostrongyl nematode  Travassosius americanus  in the stomach and several specimens of a big trematode  Stichorchis subtriquetrus in the cecum
