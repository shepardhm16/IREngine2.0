Convocation November 11  2015 General J  H  Binford Peay III Superintendent Mr  Rogers  Lieutenant Governor Northam  General Knapp  Mayor Fraim  Mr  Ramsey  members of the VMI Board of Visitors  Mr  Fain  VMI Foundation trustees  members of the Academic Board  faculty and staff  ladies and gentlemen of the Corps of Cadets  and guests  Welcome to this afternoon s Convocation marking the 176th anniversary of the founding of the Virginia Military Institute  Mr  Rogers  in a few moments the VMI Foundation will present you with its highest award  the Distinguished Service Award  And  on behalf of the entire Institute community  I congratulate you on the high honor you are about to receive and thank you for your devotion and service to the Institute  Before we begin these award proceedings  I would like to say a few words relevant to this day in the history of VMI and to its visionary Founders  Preston  Crozet  and Smith  When we think of the Founders  we tend to think of them as historical figures  living long ago  in a world far different from our own  Although they had no automobiles  planes  telephones  computers  or the other marvels of the modern age  their world was being transformed by the new technologies of their day  steam engines  the telegraph  high speed printing presses  and railroads  to name a few  As is the case for us  they too had to adjust their thinking  behavior  and outlook to a rapidly changing world  In that sense  therefore  we can say that they are not simply historical figures  but modern men facing a modern world  Being modern men  one wonders what they would say about the world we live in and  more specifically  about VMI if they were to reappear among us today  It is an interesting question  but it is not very unusual  It is probably the standard question posed by speakers at typical anniversary ceremonies at many other colleges and universities about their founders  And the standard answer  no doubt is   Our founders would be filled with amazement and wonder by the changes  The same answer certainly can be assumed of our own founders  although because they were  forward looking  innovative  and scientific minded men  their sense of surprise probably would not be complete  Yet  it has been over 100 years since they passed from the scene  and almost everything has changed  Let me bring this question forward a bit  What if graduates of only 50 years ago  or when Mr  Rogers was completing his 3rd Class Year suddenly awakened from a long Rip van Winkle like sleep and saw the Institute as it is today  What would their reaction be to VMI today   only 50 years after they received their diplomas  That is not a long period of time  but I think they  too  would be filled with a sense of amazement and wonder at what they would see around them  The Corps numbered only about 1000 cadets fifty years ago  living in Old and New Barracks  with rooms furnished with green tables and other items that dated from the 1890s  The Corps was single sex and had not yet enrolled its first African Americans  Many of the professors were veterans of WWII  and a fair number were VMI graduates  Church attendance was mandatory  as was commissioning of all Cadets  Under Section Marcher control  Cadets formed outside their class s academic building and marched to each class  Cadets attended Saturday classes from 0800 until noon  Church call was also mandatory with cadets in church formations under the ranking cadet marching throughout Lexington to their respective place of worship  Most cadets carried slide rules on their belts  the only computational device available  If information was needed  they consulted a myriad of encyclopedias in Preston Library  a source of information which was probably out of date the moment it was published  Fifty years ago  there was one incredibly large  second hand IBM mainframe computer on post  and it was used  principally  for administration and to teach the rudimentary art of programming  Barracks and the other buildings on Post were heated by coal fed steam boilers  Buildings were not air conditioned  which meant that everyone had to suffer through seasons of severe heat  and with open windows  during exam week  listening to the W L parties next door as we studied for final exams  There was one television with three channels and an antenna for reception in a special PX room for all cadets to watch  Cadets were virtually isolated most of the time as there were only a few pay phones in the Concourse near the arms room  for which cadets waited in long lines to use  In town  there was a Western Union office that enabled people to send telegrams  Free time uptown was confined to Wednesday afternoons and weekends  after football games dining in the Southern Inn and normally ordering their superb meatloaf  there was really very little to do in Lexington  Few cadets had cars  and then only during the last semester of the First Class year  A train continued to arrive in Lexington until Hurricane Camille four years later washed out the railroad bridge over the Maury River  Think of what someone from that time   only fifty years ago   who regained consciousness today  would see and experience  What would have been his reaction to the news that man had walked on the moon  that space probes have gone to Mars and Pluto  to name just a few of the amazing achievements of science  and  that our country won a  cold war  fought in Vietnam  the Persian Gulf  and the broader Middle East  and Korea still remains divided and dangerous  There are many more examples  but let us  only  consider what a cadet then would see at VMI  Cadets still live in the Barracks  they still wear the historic uniform  they are still governed by traditional cadet organizations and systems  and they still adhere to a strong Honor System  On the other hand  the entire make up of the Corps of Cadets has changed  The Corps of Cadets is now a diverse body of nearly 1700 cadets from all over our nation  including not only women and African Americans but cadets from foreign countries living in three barracks  The faculty is equally diverse  drawn from national and international locations  mostly Ph D  terribly qualified and the Institute is nationally ranked  highly ranked  by almost all periodicals  Our science and engineering laboratories  in many respects  are state of the art  our liberal arts team is one of the best in America  and cadets are engaged not only in classroom learning but in research with their professors  Cadets are learning Arabic and Chinese  The ROTC program has expanded from two departments   Army and Air Force   to Naval and Marine ROTC  And  although some of the academic program familiar to cadets fifty years ago remains  there has been a steady  remodeling  updating  and realigning of the curriculum  including the addition of new majors Mechanical Engineering  Psychology  International Studies  Economics and Business  and Computer and Information Science  The Post has physically changed with a new North and South Post  major modernization of all facilities on Letcher Avenue   Academic Row  the addition of 200 acres and McKethan Farm for ROTC training  a Physical Plant at Lackey Park  and the addition of Stonewall Jackson s home and the New Market Battlefield among others  The most notable change that would be seen by our visitors from fifty years ago  however  would be in technology and communication  Computers  the Internet  cell phones  and other devices have changed how we go about almost everything we do at the Institute  Through personal computers  a high tech post  and now smart phones  cadets with a hand held device  have a  window  connected to the world  information is available at the touch of a button  and it is real time and unlimited  Cadets have a library   larger than the Library of Congress many times over   in their pocket  That yesterday was  stunningly different  in many ways from today  And what of fifty years from now  What will the Institute be like  The solid core and core values of the Institute will remain  but the thought behind science  humanities  and society will continue to evolve and change so that if we were to wake up in fifty years from today  we would probably share the amazement and wonder that those of fifty years ago would feel today  Unfortunately  the possibility of war and aggression clouds much of this today the threat to our way of living  and thus the impact on the Institute  Yet  in this  we are like the Founders themselves facing very difficult challenges on this Founders Day and Veterans Day  Fortunately  you  our Corps of Cadets  will not be asleep for the next fifty years  You will be part of the exciting changes and important developments that will take place  and so will the Institute  For I know  that you will learn and demonstrate as all those who came before of the power of living lives that recognize responsibility for others  You are trusted  You hone your sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust physical program  The VMI experience prepares you for the life ahead  a life of strength and honor  And on this anniversary the VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  integrity  and perseverance   is the  common bond  of true citizen soldiers  who in military or civilian roles  will serve the nation so superbly in times of peace and deepest peril  As such  in 2039  our 200th Anniversary  you will be leading and creating positive change for society and the world that we can only contemplate this afternoon  I have the greatest confidence and absolutely no doubt in your national and community participation and leadership  The Institute will  continue  to be heard from today  Now it is my distinct pleasure to introduce Mr  Hugh Fain  VMI Class of 1980  who will introduce today s honoree  Mr  Fain is the President of the VMI Foundation  which sponsors today s prestigious award  A graduate of the Class of 1980  he was vice president of his Class and a prosecutor on the Honor Court  After graduating

General J  H  Binford Peay III Superintendent Mr  Rogers  Lieutenant Governor Northam  General Knapp  Mayor Fraim  Mr  Ramsey  members of the VMI Board of Visitors  Mr  Fain  VMI Foundation trustees  members of the Academic Board  faculty and staff  ladies and gentlemen of the Corps of Cadets  and guests  Welcome to this afternoon s Convocation marking the 176th anniversary of the founding of the Virginia Military Institute  Mr  Rogers  in a few moments the VMI Foundation will present you with its highest award  the Distinguished Service Award  And  on behalf of the entire Institute community  I congratulate you on the high honor you are about to receive and thank you for your devotion and service to the Institute  Before we begin these award proceedings  I would like to say a few words relevant to this day in the history of VMI and to its visionary Founders  Preston  Crozet  and Smith  When we think of the Founders  we tend to think of them as historical figures  living long ago  in a world far different from our own  Although they had no automobiles  planes  telephones  computers  or the other marvels of the modern age  their world was being transformed by the new technologies of their day  steam engines  the telegraph  high speed printing presses  and railroads  to name a few  As is the case for us  they too had to adjust their thinking  behavior  and outlook to a rapidly changing world  In that sense  therefore  we can say that they are not simply historical figures  but modern men facing a modern world  Being modern men  one wonders what they would say about the world we live in and  more specifically  about VMI if they were to reappear among us today  It is an interesting question  but it is not very unusual  It is probably the standard question posed by speakers at typical anniversary ceremonies at many other colleges and universities about their founders  And the standard answer  no doubt is   Our founders would be filled with amazement and wonder by the changes  The same answer certainly can be assumed of our own founders  although because they were  forward looking  innovative  and scientific minded men  their sense of surprise probably would not be complete  Yet  it has been over 100 years since they passed from the scene  and almost everything has changed  Let me bring this question forward a bit  What if graduates of only 50 years ago  or when Mr  Rogers was completing his 3rd Class Year suddenly awakened from a long Rip van Winkle like sleep and saw the Institute as it is today  What would their reaction be to VMI today   only 50 years after they received their diplomas  That is not a long period of time  but I think they  too  would be filled with a sense of amazement and wonder at what they would see around them  The Corps numbered only about 1000 cadets fifty years ago  living in Old and New Barracks  with rooms furnished with green tables and other items that dated from the 1890s  The Corps was single sex and had not yet enrolled its first African Americans  Many of the professors were veterans of WWII  and a fair number were VMI graduates  Church attendance was mandatory  as was commissioning of all Cadets  Under Section Marcher control  Cadets formed outside their class s academic building and marched to each class  Cadets attended Saturday classes from 0800 until noon  Church call was also mandatory with cadets in church formations under the ranking cadet marching throughout Lexington to their respective place of worship  Most cadets carried slide rules on their belts  the only computational device available  If information was needed  they consulted a myriad of encyclopedias in Preston Library  a source of information which was probably out of date the moment it was published  Fifty years ago  there was one incredibly large  second hand IBM mainframe computer on post  and it was used  principally  for administration and to teach the rudimentary art of programming  Barracks and the other buildings on Post were heated by coal fed steam boilers  Buildings were not air conditioned  which meant that everyone had to suffer through seasons of severe heat  and with open windows  during exam week  listening to the W L parties next door as we studied for final exams  There was one television with three channels and an antenna for reception in a special PX room for all cadets to watch  Cadets were virtually isolated most of the time as there were only a few pay phones in the Concourse near the arms room  for which cadets waited in long lines to use  In town  there was a Western Union office that enabled people to send telegrams  Free time uptown was confined to Wednesday afternoons and weekends  after football games dining in the Southern Inn and normally ordering their superb meatloaf  there was really very little to do in Lexington  Few cadets had cars  and then only during the last semester of the First Class year  A train continued to arrive in Lexington until Hurricane Camille four years later washed out the railroad bridge over the Maury River  Think of what someone from that time   only fifty years ago   who regained consciousness today  would see and experience  What would have been his reaction to the news that man had walked on the moon  that space probes have gone to Mars and Pluto  to name just a few of the amazing achievements of science  and  that our country won a  cold war  fought in Vietnam  the Persian Gulf  and the broader Middle East  and Korea still remains divided and dangerous  There are many more examples  but let us  only  consider what a cadet then would see at VMI  Cadets still live in the Barracks  they still wear the historic uniform  they are still governed by traditional cadet organizations and systems  and they still adhere to a strong Honor System  On the other hand  the entire make up of the Corps of Cadets has changed  The Corps of Cadets is now a diverse body of nearly 1700 cadets from all over our nation  including not only women and African Americans but cadets from foreign countries living in three barracks  The faculty is equally diverse  drawn from national and international locations  mostly Ph D  terribly qualified and the Institute is nationally ranked  highly ranked  by almost all periodicals  Our science and engineering laboratories  in many respects  are state of the art  our liberal arts team is one of the best in America  and cadets are engaged not only in classroom learning but in research with their professors  Cadets are learning Arabic and Chinese  The ROTC program has expanded from two departments   Army and Air Force   to Naval and Marine ROTC  And  although some of the academic program familiar to cadets fifty years ago remains  there has been a steady  remodeling  updating  and realigning of the curriculum  including the addition of new majors Mechanical Engineering  Psychology  International Studies  Economics and Business  and Computer and Information Science  The Post has physically changed with a new North and South Post  major modernization of all facilities on Letcher Avenue   Academic Row  the addition of 200 acres and McKethan Farm for ROTC training  a Physical Plant at Lackey Park  and the addition of Stonewall Jackson s home and the New Market Battlefield among others  The most notable change that would be seen by our visitors from fifty years ago  however  would be in technology and communication  Computers  the Internet  cell phones  and other devices have changed how we go about almost everything we do at the Institute  Through personal computers  a high tech post  and now smart phones  cadets with a hand held device  have a  window  connected to the world  information is available at the touch of a button  and it is real time and unlimited  Cadets have a library   larger than the Library of Congress many times over   in their pocket  That yesterday was  stunningly different  in many ways from today  And what of fifty years from now  What will the Institute be like  The solid core and core values of the Institute will remain  but the thought behind science  humanities  and society will continue to evolve and change so that if we were to wake up in fifty years from today  we would probably share the amazement and wonder that those of fifty years ago would feel today  Unfortunately  the possibility of war and aggression clouds much of this today the threat to our way of living  and thus the impact on the Institute  Yet  in this  we are like the Founders themselves facing very difficult challenges on this Founders Day and Veterans Day  Fortunately  you  our Corps of Cadets  will not be asleep for the next fifty years  You will be part of the exciting changes and important developments that will take place  and so will the Institute  For I know  that you will learn and demonstrate as all those who came before of the power of living lives that recognize responsibility for others  You are trusted  You hone your sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust physical program  The VMI experience prepares you for the life ahead  a life of strength and honor  And on this anniversary the VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  integrity  and perseverance   is the  common bond  of true citizen soldiers  who in military or civilian roles  will serve the nation so superbly in times of peace and deepest peril  As such  in 2039  our 200th Anniversary  you will be leading and creating positive change for society and the world that we can only contemplate this afternoon  I have the greatest confidence and absolutely no doubt in your national and community participation and leadership  The Institute will  continue  to be heard from today  Now it is my distinct pleasure to introduce Mr  Hugh Fain  VMI Class of 1980  who will introduce today s honoree  Mr  Fain is the President of the VMI Foundation  which sponsors

Superintendent Mr  Rogers  Lieutenant Governor Northam  General Knapp  Mayor Fraim  Mr  Ramsey  members of the VMI Board of Visitors  Mr  Fain  VMI Foundation trustees  members of the Academic Board  faculty and staff  ladies and gentlemen of the Corps of Cadets  and guests  Welcome to this afternoon s Convocation marking the 176th anniversary of the founding of the Virginia Military Institute  Mr  Rogers  in a few moments the VMI Foundation will present you with its highest award  the Distinguished Service Award  And  on behalf of the entire Institute community  I congratulate you on the high honor you are about to receive and thank you for your devotion and service to the Institute  Before we begin these award proceedings  I would like to say a few words relevant to this day in the history of VMI and to its visionary Founders  Preston  Crozet  and Smith  When we think of the Founders  we tend to think of them as historical figures  living long ago  in a world far different from our own  Although they had no automobiles  planes  telephones  computers  or the other marvels of the modern age  their world was being transformed by the new technologies of their day  steam engines  the telegraph  high speed printing presses  and railroads  to name a few  As is the case for us  they too had to adjust their thinking  behavior  and outlook to a rapidly changing world  In that sense  therefore  we can say that they are not simply historical figures  but modern men facing a modern world  Being modern men  one wonders what they would say about the world we live in and  more specifically  about VMI if they were to reappear among us today  It is an interesting question  but it is not very unusual  It is probably the standard question posed by speakers at typical anniversary ceremonies at many other colleges and universities about their founders  And the standard answer  no doubt is   Our founders would be filled with amazement and wonder by the changes  The same answer certainly can be assumed of our own founders  although because they were  forward looking  innovative  and scientific minded men  their sense of surprise probably would not be complete  Yet  it has been over 100 years since they passed from the scene  and almost everything has changed  Let me bring this question forward a bit  What if graduates of only 50 years ago  or when Mr  Rogers was completing his 3rd Class Year suddenly awakened from a long Rip van Winkle like sleep and saw the Institute as it is today  What would their reaction be to VMI today   only 50 years after they received their diplomas  That is not a long period of time  but I think they  too  would be filled with a sense of amazement and wonder at what they would see around them  The Corps numbered only about 1000 cadets fifty years ago  living in Old and New Barracks  with rooms furnished with green tables and other items that dated from the 1890s  The Corps was single sex and had not yet enrolled its first African Americans  Many of the professors were veterans of WWII  and a fair number were VMI graduates  Church attendance was mandatory  as was commissioning of all Cadets  Under Section Marcher control  Cadets formed outside their class s academic building and marched to each class  Cadets attended Saturday classes from 0800 until noon  Church call was also mandatory with cadets in church formations under the ranking cadet marching throughout Lexington to their respective place of worship  Most cadets carried slide rules on their belts  the only computational device available  If information was needed  they consulted a myriad of encyclopedias in Preston Library  a source of information which was probably out of date the moment it was published  Fifty years ago  there was one incredibly large  second hand IBM mainframe computer on post  and it was used  principally  for administration and to teach the rudimentary art of programming  Barracks and the other buildings on Post were heated by coal fed steam boilers  Buildings were not air conditioned  which meant that everyone had to suffer through seasons of severe heat  and with open windows  during exam week  listening to the W L parties next door as we studied for final exams  There was one television with three channels and an antenna for reception in a special PX room for all cadets to watch  Cadets were virtually isolated most of the time as there were only a few pay phones in the Concourse near the arms room  for which cadets waited in long lines to use  In town  there was a Western Union office that enabled people to send telegrams  Free time uptown was confined to Wednesday afternoons and weekends  after football games dining in the Southern Inn and normally ordering their superb meatloaf  there was really very little to do in Lexington  Few cadets had cars  and then only during the last semester of the First Class year  A train continued to arrive in Lexington until Hurricane Camille four years later washed out the railroad bridge over the Maury River  Think of what someone from that time   only fifty years ago   who regained consciousness today  would see and experience  What would have been his reaction to the news that man had walked on the moon  that space probes have gone to Mars and Pluto  to name just a few of the amazing achievements of science  and  that our country won a  cold war  fought in Vietnam  the Persian Gulf  and the broader Middle East  and Korea still remains divided and dangerous  There are many more examples  but let us  only  consider what a cadet then would see at VMI  Cadets still live in the Barracks  they still wear the historic uniform  they are still governed by traditional cadet organizations and systems  and they still adhere to a strong Honor System  On the other hand  the entire make up of the Corps of Cadets has changed  The Corps of Cadets is now a diverse body of nearly 1700 cadets from all over our nation  including not only women and African Americans but cadets from foreign countries living in three barracks  The faculty is equally diverse  drawn from national and international locations  mostly Ph D  terribly qualified and the Institute is nationally ranked  highly ranked  by almost all periodicals  Our science and engineering laboratories  in many respects  are state of the art  our liberal arts team is one of the best in America  and cadets are engaged not only in classroom learning but in research with their professors  Cadets are learning Arabic and Chinese  The ROTC program has expanded from two departments   Army and Air Force   to Naval and Marine ROTC  And  although some of the academic program familiar to cadets fifty years ago remains  there has been a steady  remodeling  updating  and realigning of the curriculum  including the addition of new majors Mechanical Engineering  Psychology  International Studies  Economics and Business  and Computer and Information Science  The Post has physically changed with a new North and South Post  major modernization of all facilities on Letcher Avenue   Academic Row  the addition of 200 acres and McKethan Farm for ROTC training  a Physical Plant at Lackey Park  and the addition of Stonewall Jackson s home and the New Market Battlefield among others  The most notable change that would be seen by our visitors from fifty years ago  however  would be in technology and communication  Computers  the Internet  cell phones  and other devices have changed how we go about almost everything we do at the Institute  Through personal computers  a high tech post  and now smart phones  cadets with a hand held device  have a  window  connected to the world  information is available at the touch of a button  and it is real time and unlimited  Cadets have a library   larger than the Library of Congress many times over   in their pocket  That yesterday was  stunningly different  in many ways from today  And what of fifty years from now  What will the Institute be like  The solid core and core values of the Institute will remain  but the thought behind science  humanities  and society will continue to evolve and change so that if we were to wake up in fifty years from today  we would probably share the amazement and wonder that those of fifty years ago would feel today  Unfortunately  the possibility of war and aggression clouds much of this today the threat to our way of living  and thus the impact on the Institute  Yet  in this  we are like the Founders themselves facing very difficult challenges on this Founders Day and Veterans Day  Fortunately  you  our Corps of Cadets  will not be asleep for the next fifty years  You will be part of the exciting changes and important developments that will take place  and so will the Institute  For I know  that you will learn and demonstrate as all those who came before of the power of living lives that recognize responsibility for others  You are trusted  You hone your sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust physical program  The VMI experience prepares you for the life ahead  a life of strength and honor  And on this anniversary the VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  integrity  and perseverance   is the  common bond  of true citizen soldiers  who in military or civilian roles  will serve the nation so superbly in times of peace and deepest peril  As such  in 2039  our 200th Anniversary  you will be leading and creating positive change for society and the world that we can only contemplate this afternoon  I have the greatest confidence and absolutely no doubt in your national and community participation and leadership  The Institute will  continue  to be heard from today  Now it is my distinct pleasure to introduce Mr  Hugh Fain  VMI Class of 1980  who will introduce today s honoree  Mr  Fain is the President of the VMI Foundation  which sponsors today s prestigious award  A graduate of the Class of 1980  he was vice president of his Class and a prosecutor on the Honor Court  After graduating with distinction with a BA degree in Economics  he attended the University of Virginia Law School where he earned his JD degree in 1983  He is now the managing director   partner of Spotts Fain  a law firm in Richmond  He was named by his peers in Chambers USA Best Lawyers in

men  their sense of surprise probably would not be complete  Yet  it has been over 100 years since they passed from the scene  and almost everything has changed  Let me bring this question forward a bit  What if graduates of only 50 years ago  or when Mr  Rogers was completing his 3rd Class Year suddenly awakened from a long Rip van Winkle like sleep and saw the Institute as it is today  What would their reaction be to VMI today   only 50 years after they received their diplomas  That is not a long period of time  but I think they  too  would be filled with a sense of amazement and wonder at what they would see around them  The Corps numbered only about 1000 cadets fifty years ago  living in Old and New Barracks  with rooms furnished with green tables and other items that dated from the 1890s  The Corps was single sex and had not yet enrolled its first African Americans  Many of the professors were veterans of WWII  and a fair number were VMI graduates  Church attendance was mandatory  as was commissioning of all Cadets  Under Section Marcher control  Cadets formed outside their class s academic building and marched to each class  Cadets attended Saturday classes from 0800 until noon  Church call was also mandatory with cadets in church formations under the ranking cadet marching throughout Lexington to their respective place of worship  Most cadets carried slide rules on their belts  the only computational device available  If information was needed  they consulted a myriad of encyclopedias in Preston Library  a source of information which was probably out of date the moment it was published  Fifty years ago  there was one incredibly large  second hand IBM mainframe computer on post  and it was used  principally  for administration and to teach the rudimentary art of programming  Barracks and the other buildings on Post were heated by coal fed steam boilers  Buildings were not air conditioned  which meant that everyone had to suffer through seasons of severe heat  and with open windows  during exam week  listening to the W L parties next door as we studied for final exams  There was one television with three channels and an antenna for reception in a special PX room for all cadets to watch  Cadets were virtually isolated most of the time as there were only a few pay phones in the Concourse near the arms room  for which cadets waited in long lines to use  In town  there was a Western Union office that enabled people to send telegrams  Free time uptown was confined to Wednesday afternoons and weekends  after football games dining in the Southern Inn and normally ordering their superb meatloaf  there was really very little to do in Lexington  Few cadets had cars  and then only during the last semester of the First Class year  A train continued to arrive in Lexington until Hurricane Camille four years later washed out the railroad bridge over the Maury River  Think of what someone from that time   only fifty years ago   who regained consciousness today  would see and experience  What would have been his reaction to the news that man had walked on the moon  that space probes have gone to Mars and Pluto  to name just a few of the amazing achievements of science  and  that our country won a  cold war  fought in Vietnam  the Persian Gulf  and the broader Middle East  and Korea still remains divided and dangerous  There are many more examples  but let us  only  consider what a cadet then would see at VMI  Cadets still live in the Barracks  they still wear the historic uniform  they are still governed by traditional cadet organizations and systems  and they still adhere to a strong Honor System  On the other hand  the entire make up of the Corps of Cadets has changed  The Corps of Cadets is now a diverse body of nearly 1700 cadets from all over our nation  including not only women and African Americans but cadets from foreign countries living in three barracks  The faculty is equally diverse  drawn from national and international locations  mostly Ph D  terribly qualified and the Institute is nationally ranked  highly ranked  by almost all periodicals  Our science and engineering laboratories  in many respects  are state of the art  our liberal arts team is one of the best in America  and cadets are engaged not only in classroom learning but in research with their professors  Cadets are learning Arabic and Chinese  The ROTC program has expanded from two departments   Army and Air Force   to Naval and Marine ROTC  And  although some of the academic program familiar to cadets fifty years ago remains  there has been a steady  remodeling  updating  and realigning of the curriculum  including the addition of new majors Mechanical Engineering  Psychology  International Studies  Economics and Business  and Computer and Information Science  The Post has physically changed with a new North and South Post  major modernization of all facilities on Letcher Avenue   Academic Row  the addition of 200 acres and McKethan Farm for ROTC training  a Physical Plant at Lackey Park  and the addition of Stonewall Jackson s home and the New Market Battlefield among others  The most notable change that would be seen by our visitors from fifty years ago  however  would be in technology and communication  Computers  the Internet  cell phones  and other devices have changed how we go about almost everything we do at the Institute  Through personal computers  a high tech post  and now smart phones  cadets with a hand held device  have a  window  connected to the world  information is available at the touch of a button  and it is real time and unlimited  Cadets have a library   larger than the Library of Congress many times over   in their pocket  That yesterday was  stunningly different  in many ways from today  And what of fifty years from now  What will the Institute be like  The solid core and core values of the Institute will remain  but the thought behind science  humanities  and society will continue to evolve and change so that if we were to wake up in fifty years from today  we would probably share the amazement and wonder that those of fifty years ago would feel today  Unfortunately  the possibility of war and aggression clouds much of this today the threat to our way of living  and thus the impact on the Institute  Yet  in this  we are like the Founders themselves facing very difficult challenges on this Founders Day and Veterans Day  Fortunately  you  our Corps of Cadets  will not be asleep for the next fifty years  You will be part of the exciting changes and important developments that will take place  and so will the Institute  For I know  that you will learn and demonstrate as all those who came before of the power of living lives that recognize responsibility for others  You are trusted  You hone your sharpness through a rigorous military system  strong academics  and a robust physical program  The VMI experience prepares you for the life ahead  a life of strength and honor  And on this anniversary the VMI Spirit   that combination of purposefulness  loyalty  integrity  and perseverance   is the  common bond  of true citizen soldiers  who in military or civilian roles  will serve the nation so superbly in times of peace and deepest peril  As such  in 2039  our 200th Anniversary  you will be leading and creating positive change for society and the world that we can only contemplate this afternoon  I have the greatest confidence and absolutely no doubt in your national and community participation and leadership  The Institute will  continue  to be heard from today  Now it is my distinct pleasure to introduce Mr  Hugh Fain  VMI Class of 1980  who will introduce today s honoree  Mr  Fain is the
