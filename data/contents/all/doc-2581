McLaughlin  Physical Plant Employees Craft Reproduction Doors for VMI s Crozet Hall LEXINGTON  Va  Dec  19  2014   A project currently under way in the VMI physical plant has not only saved the state thousands of dollars  but brought historical authenticity back to one of VMI s most well known and heavily trafficked buildings  Just before Christmas furlough began  locksmith Tommy Tomlin and assistant locksmiths Mark Lynn and Kevin Scott were busy hanging the new wooden doors that had been crafted in house for Crozet Hall  often referred to as the mess hall  The project is part of an effort that s been ongoing since 2010 to restore or replace the front exterior doors to many of the key buildings on post  The current doors on Crozet Hall were put up in 2005  and began to show wear quickly  explained Mike Jennings  chief of fire and safety programs   They were just bought doors  he commented  adding that the 2005 project replaced only the doors themselves  not the jambs and transoms  Those doors were only the second set ever hung on the building  as the original doors from 1934 had remained in place until then  Wanting to restore Crozet Hall s architectural integrity  the physical plant staff began in August by taking a close look at a photograph of the 1934 doors that Col  Keith Gibson  77  executive director of the VMI Museum System  had found in the VMI Archives  Working from that photograph  Tomlin  Lynn  and Scott created a plan for three sets of double doors that would be hung on the front of the building facing Letcher Avenue  The work was painstaking  and the amount of materials needed was much higher than the casual onlooker might have guessed  Lynn counted 1 209 pieces of wood  glass  and hardware per door  including 547 pieces of wood in each transom alone   There s a lot of pieces you don t see  he commented  gesturing to the fir core of each door  which is sandwiched between two pieces of oak   It adds up pretty quick  Jennings explained that the types of wood   fir and oak   were chosen for their durability   The Crozet Hall doors  do take a lot of abuse  he noted  To complete the historical look  the physical plant employees crafted new transoms to replace the aging ones currently in place and ordered period hardware from Ball and Ball  a Pennsylvania firm specializing in antique reproduction hardware   Now it s a solid door that looks like the period door  historically accurate and a lot cheaper because we did it in house  said Jennings   We replaced everything  Jennings was quick to praise the craftsmanship and dedication shown by Tomlin  Lynn  and Scott  who each put in many hours of work on the project   The quality of work in the doors is something that you cannot go to a vendor and buy  Jennings noted  Concurring with Jennings  assessment  Gibson remarked   This project restores one of the key architectural elements of the 1934 Mess Hall  Doors represent a focus point on the architectural fa ade  a place where great attention is placed  This work by our own VMI crew not only exhibits their craftsmanship  but also their commitment to researching the original design and faithfully replicating it  It is amazing to see our crew take a pile of oak planks and produce such workmanship  The doors that were replaced before Christmas were those closest to Main Street  The other two sets  which are currently under construction  are scheduled to be hung in time for graduation in May  Jennings explained that once the Crozet doors are completed  the next project will be crafting new doors for Scott Shipp Hall  home to multiple academic departments and the meeting place for many classes  Over the past few years  physical plant employees have crafted new doors for Jackson Memorial Hall  Preston Library  Shell Hall  Carroll Hall  and most recently  Nichols Engineering Building  Other recent projects have included refinishing of the doors on Kilbourne Hall facing Main Street  and building new doors for the side entrances to Crozet Hall facing Main Street  Is there an end point to the door project  Jennings thinks not   Wood doors outside    you have to keep going back to maintain the finish  he noted  explaining that each summer  physical plant staff go through to refinish doors that have been marred by scuffs and stains   We re not ever really finished    Mary Price  VMI  VMI Foundation
