small Shenandoah Valley town of Lexington  the home of the Virginia Military Institute  The federal forces  about 18 000 strong  entered the town on the afternoon of June 11  Although their arrival had been briefly delayed by the resistance of a small cavalry force led by General John McCausland  a VMI graduate and former faculty member  the Confederate troops were greatly outnumbered and were soon forced to retreat  The VMI Corps of Cadets  having only recently returned to VMI after their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15  were also ordered to retreat  they camped near the top of the Blue Ridge Mountains  about two miles from Balcony Falls  on the night of the 11th   There were no civilian or military casualties as a result of this occupation  However  VMI was both the site of a state arsenal and a military training school  and the Institute was considered to be a legitimate military target  On June 12  Hunter ordered the burning of VMI  The cadet Barracks  at left  and two faculty residences were extensively damaged  and other Institute property most importantly the valuable library  laboratory and scientific equipment was destroyed  The troops also removed the Institute s statue of George Washington  which was taken to Wheeling  West Virginia as a trophy of war  it was returned in 1866  The Union forces left on June 14  marching over the mountains to Lynchburg  Following these events  the Corps of Cadets was furloughed while officials examined various plans for reopening the school  Because of extensive damage to the buildings  library  and supplies  Gen  Smith and the VMI Board of Visitors decided that is was not feasible to bring the cadets back to Lexington  In December 1864  academic work resumed at the Alms House in

Home General David Hunter   the Burning of VMI  June 1864  For four days in June 1864  Union troops commanded by General David Hunter occupied the small Shenandoah Valley town of Lexington  the home of the Virginia Military Institute  The federal forces  about 18 000 strong  entered the town on the afternoon of June 11  Although their arrival had been briefly delayed by the resistance of a small cavalry force led by General John McCausland  a VMI graduate and former faculty member  the Confederate troops were greatly outnumbered and were soon forced to retreat  The VMI Corps of Cadets  having only recently returned to VMI after their participation in the Battle of New Market on May 15  were also ordered to retreat  they camped near the top of the Blue Ridge Mountains  about two miles from Balcony Falls  on the night of the 11th   There were no civilian or military casualties as a result of this occupation  However  VMI was both the site of a state arsenal and a military training school  and the Institute was considered to be a legitimate military target  On June 12  Hunter ordered the burning of VMI  The cadet Barracks  at left  and two faculty residences were extensively damaged  and other Institute property most importantly the valuable library  laboratory and scientific equipment was destroyed  The troops also removed the Institute s statue of George Washington  which was taken to Wheeling  West Virginia as a trophy of war  it was returned in 1866  The Union forces left on June 14  marching over the mountains to Lynchburg  Following these events  the Corps of Cadets was furloughed while officials examined various plans for reopening the school  Because of extensive damage to the buildings  library  and supplies  Gen  Smith and the VMI Board of Visitors decided that is was not feasible to bring the cadets back to Lexington  In December 1864  academic work resumed at the Alms House in Richmond  which became VMI s temporary headquarters  The Corps remained in
