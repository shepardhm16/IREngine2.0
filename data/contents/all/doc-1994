Exam Everybody knows what it s like to face the blank answer sheet of a multiple choice test  But what s it like to be on the opposite side of the desk  and write the questions for such a test  especially one that is administered nationally  That s the experience Lt  Col  Stan Smith  associate professor of chemistry  had this spring when he helped to write questions for the American Chemical Society s organic chemistry exam  The 70 question exam is given at colleges and universities across the country so professors can gauge how their students are doing compared to others around the nation  Students taking the test are typically chemistry or biology majors in their second or third year of college  The ACS s organic chemistry exam has not been given at VMI in the last few years  although some professors teaching other branches of chemistry do administer ACS tests   It s been great to see how the whole process works  said Smith  who took the organic chemistry exam himself when he was an undergraduate at the University of Central Florida  Smith heard about the opportunity to craft the next ACS exam through Col  Daren Timmons  department head  Timmons had participated in writing ACS exam questions in the past  Smith put his name into consideration as a potential participant two years ago  but did not hear until last year that he d been selected  He traveled to New Orleans  La  in April to meet with 14 other chemistry professors from around the country and narrow down a pool of 300 potential questions  Smith contributed questions having to do with six areas of organic chemistry  including  green chemistry  and nomenclature  As its name suggests  green chemistry has to do with conducting experiments in an environmentally friendly manner   In organic laboratory  there s a push to find cheaper  more easily disposable  greener processes  said Smith  He noted that interest in green chemistry seems to be growing  and questions about that domain have begun appearing on the ACS exams in the last five years or so  Nomenclature  or naming  is of special interest to a chemist  said Smith  because with a potentially exponential combination of elements  there s an urgent need to name those combinations in a way that others can understand   If you start with 10 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms  there are at least 75 molecules that can be formed from these atoms  Smith explained   If you start with 20 carbon atoms and 42 hydrogen atoms  there are around 62 trillion molecules that can be formed    It can get out of control unless there are rules to govern how molecules are named  And while the questions for the new version of the ACS test have been written  Smith s work is far from done  There are two more meetings scheduled  one to create two mock tests that will be given to students  and another to review the students  performance on the tests  Smith  meanwhile  said he s already reaped benefits from participation in the test crafting process   One of the benefits has been seeing how multiple choice questions are designed  he said   There s actually a lot of thought and philosophy that other people have put into what makes a good multiple choice question   Seeing the effort that goes into these questions has been very good for me pedagogically  By   Mary Price IR   June 2013   VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams
