Reminisces About Life on Ruff Lane LEXINGTON  Va  Dec  19  2014   Since last summer  backhoes and blasting have been part of daily life in the Diamond Hill area of Lexington  as crews from Whiting Turner Contracting Co  have been hard at work with site preparations for the Corps Physical Training Facility  All of the dynamite and digging in the world  though  can t remove what s precious for one lifelong Lexington resident  memories of the little house on Ruff Lane  now demolished  where she and her twin brother entered the world on Nov  26  1930  At the end of October  Helen Bayne was escorted by Col  Keith Jarvis  82  deputy director of construction  for a last visit of the site of her childhood home  Once the  80 million Corps Physical Training Facility is completed  the hillside that Bayne called home for the first two decades of her life will be obliterated  encompassed in the massive building s footprint  The street   Ruff Lane   will also be removed during the construction process  Memory  though  persists  and on that day it was helped along by a glass mayonnaise jar  which she d brought along with the hope that she d be allowed to fill the jar with dirt  Sure enough  Jarvis descended the steep slope on Bayne s behalf and returned the jar filled with earth  Just moments beforehand  Bayne had accepted a small gift from Don Spurrier of Whiting Turner  the green street sign bearing the words  Ruff Lane  It s hard to imagine anyone who would have appreciated the gift more  Bayne  who was the first woman to work in Crozet Hall  belongs to that vanishing generation of Lexingtonians who can remember when hogs were kept where Cameron Hall is now and when women in need of extra income took in laundry  Bayne s mother  the late Nellie Thompson  was one of those women  doing laundry for as many as 30 families at a time  plus students from Washington and Lee University   There weren t no Laundromats back then  recalled Bayne on a recent afternoon as she sat at the kitchen table of the house on Massie Street where she s lived for the past 45 years  Her father worked on a farm and as a carpenter  but the lack of work in winter meant an uncertain income for the family  which included not only Bayne and her twin brother  the late James  but also two half brothers   If it weren t for Mama  I don t know what would have happened  said Bayne  who recalled her father helping to heat water on a cook stove in the winter so his wife could wash clothes  Year round  the family hung the laundry out to dry on clotheslines that straddled Town Branch  the small stream running between Ruff Lane and Main Street  In the colder months  the laundry simply froze there  At 20  Bayne stood in the same spot where her parents had stood to be married  and emerged as the wife of Burnet  Buddy  Bayne  He worked in Crozet Hall  and his wife found employment there as well  Struggling with grief after her twin brother s death in 1964  Helen Bayne needed a way to occupy her mind and heart  and she quickly found her calling in VMI s bake shop  which at that time produced all of its own bread and other baked goods   I had to get out  I had to do something  Bayne explained  Soon  she became  Miss Helen  to legions of hungry cadets  The diminutive Bayne quickly gained a reputation as a friend to those in trouble and those simply hungry at odd hours  Once  she recalled  she helped a cadet who was supposed to be on confinement in barracks hide in a walk in steamer  Often  Bayne would make extra garlic bread with butter   a cadet favorite   and hide it under a tablecloth for latecomers   I had them spoiled to death  said Bayne of the cadets  The work was hard and the hours long   Bayne recalls having to be at the mess hall at 2 a m  on Sunday mornings to prepare and ice cinnamon buns  another cadet favorite   but there were familiar faces in the form of her husband and one of her half brothers  who was head baker  The yardstick that he once used to cut precise servings of sheet cake to serve to the cadets is now part of the VMI Museum collection  thanks to a donation from Bayne  Shortly after lunchtime  the breakfast and lunch mess hall employees would head home   You d see them coming up the road  carrying these white sacks  Bayne recalled  The sacks held leftovers  she explained  as workers then were paid not only in money but in free food for their families  As a child  Bayne had frequently been sent to the mess hall to buy soup bones  as VMI cut up all of its own meat back then  Other items from VMI came free of charge   Cadets  as they were leaving  used to throw stuff out of the window and down the hill  recalled Bayne  One such item  which now occupies a place of honor over Bayne s sofa  was a picture that her twin brother found discarded one day  Over the years  the Lexington that Bayne knew as a child has slipped away  The horses that were once stabled in what is now Cormack Hall are now but a fragment of Bayne s memory  and the pens where the Bayne family kept their hogs disappeared long before Cameron Hall was built in the late 1970s  And in a happy turn of events  Bayne s nephew  the son of her late twin brother  works for Whiting Turner  When he comes to work on the Corps Physical Training Facility  he s but a stone s throw from the spot where his father was born    Mary Price  VMI  VMI
