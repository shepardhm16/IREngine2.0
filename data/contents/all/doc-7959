The Andromeda galaxy is the closest large spiral galaxy  and the only other large spiral in the small cluster of galaxies where the Milky Way is located  It is very nearby  on a cosmic scale  with a distance of roughly two million light years  and the central core is visible to the unaided eye from a dark location  away from city lights  in the constellation of Andromeda  The famous Andromeda galaxy is a huge spiral galaxy  like our own Milky Way  The two small diffuse objects are small galaxies in orbit around M31  The stars seen are foreground stars in our own galaxy  Through most

years  and the central core is visible to the unaided eye from a dark location  away from city lights  in the constellation of Andromeda  The famous Andromeda galaxy is a huge spiral galaxy  like our own Milky Way  The two small diffuse objects are small galaxies in orbit around M31  The stars seen are foreground stars in our own galaxy  Through most telescopes only the bright central core of the galaxy can be seen  partly because of the angular scale and partly because of the faintness  What is rather striking about M31  31 in the Messier catalog  is the angular extent of this galaxy across the sky  The full moon subtends an angle of 1 2 degree  and this galaxy spreads out approximately 15 times the size of the full moon  Our eyes are not sensitive enough to see the outer regions of this galaxy  but a photograph will capture this  The image below was obtained with a 20 minute exposure on T Max 400 black   white film    CCD Image of Orion Nebula  Film has been used for over 100 years to capture the faint astronomical objects through the telescope  and has served a very useful function  Now  electronic imaging has taken over for quantitative measurements  and charge coupled devices are the dominant electronic detectors in astronomy  We have recently obtained a new CCD camera  model AP6ep  from Apogee Instruments  The array size on this chip is 1024x1024  with a pixel size of 24 microns  Hence it is matched to the plate scale on the 20 inch reflector  and we are using it for research  Here we have  mounted this camera on our Astrophysics apochromatic refractor  for a wide field image  First results are shown here  CCD image  Orion nebula  This is a 30 second exposure of the Orion nebula obtained with a CCD camera on the 5 inch f 7 Astrophysics refractor  No filters were used  and the digital image was stretched to show the outer regions of the nebulosity  This image is approximately one fourth of the entire image  Comet Images Home   Academics   Areas of Study
