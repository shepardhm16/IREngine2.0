strength with a  value  approach  Firms on the screening list are then further analyzed  both on fundamental and technical variable  Sector analysis with a  top down  investment style is also incorporated  Members are divided into four person sector teams comprised of members from the three groups  The sector teams are tasked with providing macro analysis of their sector and making recommendations on the amount of dollars to invest in each sector  Each of the three teams is the primary micro drivers for information about individual companies and the actual analysis of stock

with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  This new club aims to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies with the intent that these activities will provide cadets with the tools and resources necessary to start a business  as well as to encourage cadets to be advocates of the American free enterprise system  The club worked with two outside companies  The first  Veteran Crowd  held a competition for the best idea to increase their customer base  The VMI team won the competition earning  500 for the club  The club also created a marketing plan for NE Solite which included a presentation given to the CEO at a lunch held in the Wheat Room at VMI  The group also travelled a bit taking three trips this past year to Washington D C  Richmond  and Lynchburg  Eric Hunter   08  VMI s Career Networking Officer  organized a trip to Lynchburg where the group toured Nanoseptic  the Center for Advanced Engineering Research and Moore and Giles  the largest leather warehouse in the US  and Downtown Lynchburg  The day also included lunch with three alumni  A trip to D C  included a tour of 1776  a startup incubator  and dinner with six alumni at the Vienna Inn  In Richmond  the group attended VA Venture Summit  a daylong conference with top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the region  They also toured UnboundRVA  a startup founded by Richard Luck  12 that helps high potential individuals in low income area start businesses  This trip was funded by Craig Forbes   77  The group hosted some notable speakers including  Mike Lloyd   07   MS in Engineering from MIT  HBS grad  and CEO of startup HireProbability  Gerald Acuff   71   owner of a pharmaceutical sales company  considered one of the top American sales experts Kippur Taylor   11   attended Babson College and founded CONTAP  an app that allows you to exchange all of your contact info and social media accounts by touching 2 phones together Finally  the group initiated the Schumpeter Faculty Award  funded by the Charles Koch Foundation  which was awarded to Ricky Siewers   15 for entrepreneur of the year  Cadet Internships In the summer of 2015  eleven cadets will be participating in internships at various businesses across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  In summer 2014  six cadets with internships earned academic credit  either an economics elective or a business elective  depending on the type of work  These cadets were required to undertake a variety of academic activities  such as a reflective essay and oral presentation to the department faculty  in addition to the work of the internship  These 6 cadets worked for  Barney   Barney  insurance  risk management  employee benefits sales  Federal Emergency Management Agency  risk analysis  risk management trainee  Northwestern Mutual Insurance  insurance company  sales and management trainee  Owens   Minor  medical supply  supply chain  Recommended Media  TV commercials  production assistant  Target Corporation  retail  store management trainee  At least 11 Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2015  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well as inside our own department  Sometimes alumni are willing to mentor cadets  but this usually requires a personal relationship to happen  All of these efforts  in combination or singly  occur each year  Some of the companies who will have cadet interns this summer include  Silvercrest  Financial  NYC Cambridge Associates Franklin Templeton in St  Petersburg  FL Northrup Grummond US Army War College in Carlisle  PA  this is not an army job  Beacon Wealthcare  Raleigh  NC ProCapital Ltd  London Canal Capital Management  Richmond State Department  digital Management  John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  Laurel MD Loughridge Construction  Roanoke  VA Some cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  some will be paid  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for those cadets who are often earning salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer  or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Bruce Macdonald  Internship Coordinator for the Department of Economics and Business  at macdonaldbn10 vmi edu

Students enrolled in Economics 405 for the Spring 2015 semester continued a Money and Banking class tradition by taking a field trip to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on March 10  This year s trip was organized by Bruce Summers  adjunct faculty member teaching Money and Banking  whose 33 year Fed career included many years at the Richmond Reserve Bank  While the itinerary was focused on central bank policy  regulatory  and operational responsibilities  the Reserve Bank also hosted a  meet and greet  session attended by the half dozen or so VMI alumni who now work for the Fed in Richmond  In addition  the students benefited from a conversation with Personnel Vice President Andy McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum  Memorandum of Understanding VMI has established memorandum of understanding  MOU  agreements with five

3 December  LTC Allen traveled with more than a dozen cadets to Richmond to tour the Federal Reserve Bank  Students enrolled in Economics 405 for the Spring 2015 semester continued a Money and Banking class tradition by taking a field trip to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on March 10  This year s trip was organized by Bruce Summers  adjunct faculty member teaching Money and Banking  whose 33 year Fed career included many years at the Richmond Reserve Bank  While the itinerary was focused on central bank policy  regulatory  and operational responsibilities  the Reserve Bank also hosted a  meet and greet  session attended by the half dozen or so VMI alumni who now work for the Fed in Richmond  In addition  the students benefited from a conversation with Personnel Vice President Andy McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum

ECBU faculty and staff  welcome to the 9th edition of the department newsletter  Academic year 2015 2016 was  like past year s  particularly busy  In addition to the many activities and events highlighted below  probably the biggest news was our re affirmation of accreditation with the Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business  AACSB International  Accreditation review and re affirmation is required every five years  Initial accreditation occurred in late fall of 2009  so  in October of 2014  our  peer review team   PRT  visited  The faculty worked diligently the past several years to continually improve our program so as to maintain AACSB International standards in all four domains  strategic management  student participation  faculty participation  and assurance of learning  assessment  We are particularly proud of our AACSB accreditation  Only some 4  of business schools worldwide are AACSB accredited  In North America  about 30   528 as of October 2014  of all business schools are AACSB accredited  Of those 30  only 9   48  are solely undergraduate degree granting institutions  That places our department in some very special company  This year was the inaugural year of a new ECBU sponsored club   the Entrepreneurship Club  An interdisciplinary group  the club had a very active first year  with several speakers and trips  With great regret we learned that Col  Francis Bush planned to retire at the end of the academic year  Francis has been a staple of the department for over 20 years  and many cadets will not likely forget the rigor and challenge of his Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting courses  Francis  contributions and selfless devotion to cadets will not be easily replaced  We hope you will enjoy reading about the many exciting activities and accomplishments of the past academic year  Just click on the topic heading for the full story  Best Regards  Col  Bob Moreschi Department Head Colonel Francis Bush We are sad to see that our friend and colleague  Francis Bush  is retiring from the Institute after 21 years of service  When summer session closes  Col  Bush will retire after 21 years of service  Over his tenure  Col  Bush has taught a wide range of courses in the department and outside of the department  Although he will probably be remember for his help classes in principles of accounting Col  Bush has also taught statistics and calculus for Business in the Math and Computer Science Department and the Environmental Management for the Environmental Leadership minor  Col  Bush s professional and service contributions were equally diverse  Along with Col  Daley  they developed the Financial Management Concentration  He served as president of the Virginia Association of Economists  Serving in various capacities for the Institute  Col  Bush led the New Faculty Orientation at Eagles Nest and chaired the Institute s scheduling committee  The most significant contributions come from his interaction with the Corps of Cadets  From the start  Col  Bush took advantage of the numerous opportunities  From breaking out with and becoming an honorary  BR  of the Class of 1998 until serving as the class adviser to 2015  Col  Bush has served as adviser to numerous clubs from VMI Theatre and the Marathon Club to Men in Grey and the cadet Publications Board  He also took advantage of various opportunities with the ROTC programs  including attending Air Force ROTC for four years with the Class of 2008  Good luck in your future  Faculty Activity Our faculty has been hard at work publishing research in academic journals as well as presenting their research at various conferences around the country and the world   Lt  Col Sam Allen Undergraduate research Renee Reives  Brandon Goodwyn

Greetings alumni and friends  On behalf of the ECBU faculty and staff  welcome to the 9th edition of the department newsletter  Academic year 2015 2016 was  like past year s  particularly busy  In addition to the many activities and events highlighted below  probably the biggest news was our re affirmation of accreditation with the Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business  AACSB International  Accreditation review and re affirmation is required every five years  Initial accreditation occurred in late fall of 2009  so  in October of 2014  our  peer review team   PRT  visited  The faculty worked diligently the past several years to continually improve our program so as to maintain AACSB International standards in all four domains  strategic management  student participation  faculty participation  and assurance of learning  assessment  We are particularly proud of our AACSB accreditation  Only some 4  of business schools worldwide are AACSB accredited  In North America  about 30   528 as of October 2014  of all business schools are AACSB accredited  Of those 30  only 9   48  are solely undergraduate degree granting institutions  That places our department in some very special company  This year was the inaugural year of a new ECBU sponsored club   the Entrepreneurship Club  An interdisciplinary group  the club had a very active first year  with several speakers and trips  With great regret we learned that Col  Francis Bush planned to retire at the end of the academic year  Francis has been a staple of the department for over 20 years  and many cadets will not likely forget the rigor and challenge of his Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting courses  Francis  contributions and selfless devotion to cadets will not be easily replaced  We hope you will enjoy reading about the many exciting activities and accomplishments of the past academic year  Just click on the topic heading for the full story  Best Regards  Col  Bob Moreschi Department Head Colonel Francis Bush We are sad to see that our friend and colleague  Francis Bush  is retiring from the Institute after 21 years of service  When summer session closes  Col  Bush will retire after 21 years of service  Over his tenure  Col  Bush has taught a wide range of courses in the department and outside of the department  Although he will probably be remember for his help classes in principles of accounting Col  Bush has also taught statistics and calculus for Business in the Math and Computer Science Department and the Environmental Management for the Environmental Leadership minor  Col  Bush s professional and service contributions were equally diverse  Along with Col  Daley  they developed the Financial Management Concentration  He served as president of the Virginia Association of Economists  Serving in various capacities for the Institute  Col  Bush led the New Faculty Orientation at Eagles Nest and chaired the Institute s scheduling committee  The most significant contributions come from his interaction with the Corps of Cadets  From the start  Col  Bush took advantage of the numerous opportunities  From breaking out with and becoming an honorary  BR  of the Class of 1998 until serving as the class adviser to 2015  Col  Bush has served as adviser to numerous clubs from VMI Theatre and the Marathon Club to Men in Grey and the cadet Publications Board  He also took advantage of various opportunities with the ROTC programs  including attending Air Force ROTC for four years with the Class of 2008  Good luck in your future

Group A new club established to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  The VMI Foundation founded and funded the Cadet Investment Group  CIG  beginning in 1986  The group s mission is to learn about the markets  stock analysis  and trading  To do this  members serve as officers  managing directors covering the major industry sectors  and as investment analysts  There are 44 cadet members  including 8 officers comprised of a Chair  Vice Chair for Education  and three teams each with a President and a Vice President  Membership is open to 1st  2nd  and 3rd class cadets in any major  Faculty advisors to the CIG are Col  Cliff West and Col  Bob Moreschi  Team A focuses on large capitalization stocks  more than  10 billion in market value  Team B invests in middle capitalization stocks  from  1 billion to  10 billion in market value  while Team C invests in small capitalization stocks  market value between  500 million and  1 billion  The groups use their own specific screening criteria  focusing on financial strength with a  value  approach  Firms on the screening list are then further analyzed  both on fundamental and technical variable  Sector analysis with a  top down  investment style is also incorporated  Members are divided into four person sector teams comprised of members from the three groups  The sector teams are tasked with providing macro analysis of their sector and making recommendations on the amount of dollars to invest in each sector  Each of the three teams is the primary micro drivers for information about individual companies and the actual analysis of stock positions to sell and new stocks to purchase  In late April 2015  the market value of the combined portfolios was almost  324 000  an increase in value of about  14 000 from April 2014  Officers in 2014 2015 were  Chairman  Chap Michie  Applied Math  Vice

educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  This new club aims to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies with the intent that these activities will provide cadets with the tools and resources necessary to start a business  as well as to encourage cadets to be advocates of the American free enterprise system  The club worked with two outside companies  The first  Veteran Crowd  held a competition for the best idea to increase their customer base  The VMI team won the competition earning  500 for the club  The club also created a marketing plan for NE Solite which included a presentation given to the CEO at a lunch held in the Wheat Room at VMI  The group also travelled a bit taking three trips this past year to Washington D C  Richmond  and Lynchburg  Eric Hunter   08  VMI s Career Networking Officer  organized a trip to Lynchburg where the group toured Nanoseptic  the Center for Advanced Engineering Research and Moore and Giles  the largest leather warehouse in the US  and Downtown Lynchburg  The day also included lunch with three alumni  A trip to D C  included a tour of 1776  a startup incubator  and dinner with six alumni at the Vienna Inn  In Richmond  the group attended VA Venture Summit  a daylong conference with top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the region  They also toured UnboundRVA  a startup founded by Richard Luck  12 that helps high potential individuals in low income area start businesses  This trip was funded by Craig Forbes   77  The group hosted some notable speakers including  Mike Lloyd   07   MS in Engineering from MIT  HBS grad  and CEO of startup HireProbability  Gerald Acuff   71   owner of a pharmaceutical sales company  considered one of the top American sales experts Kippur Taylor   11   attended Babson College and founded CONTAP  an app that allows you to exchange all of your contact info and social media accounts by touching 2 phones together Finally  the group initiated the Schumpeter Faculty Award  funded by the Charles Koch Foundation  which was awarded to Ricky Siewers   15 for entrepreneur of the year  Cadet Internships In the summer of 2015  eleven cadets will be participating in internships at various businesses across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  In summer 2014  six cadets with internships earned academic credit  either an economics elective or a business elective  depending on the type of work  These cadets were required to undertake a variety of academic activities  such as a reflective essay and oral presentation to the department faculty  in addition to the work of the internship  These 6 cadets worked for  Barney   Barney  insurance  risk management  employee benefits sales  Federal Emergency Management Agency  risk analysis  risk management trainee  Northwestern Mutual Insurance  insurance company  sales and management trainee  Owens   Minor  medical supply  supply chain  Recommended Media  TV commercials  production assistant  Target Corporation  retail  store management trainee  At least 11 Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2015  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well as inside our own department  Sometimes alumni are willing to mentor cadets  but this usually requires a personal relationship to happen  All of these efforts  in combination or singly  occur each year  Some of the companies who will have cadet interns this summer include  Silvercrest  Financial  NYC Cambridge Associates Franklin Templeton in St  Petersburg  FL Northrup Grummond US Army War College in Carlisle  PA  this is not an army job  Beacon Wealthcare  Raleigh  NC ProCapital Ltd  London Canal Capital Management  Richmond State Department  digital Management  John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  Laurel MD Loughridge Construction  Roanoke  VA Some cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  some will be paid  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for those cadets who are often earning salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer  or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Bruce Macdonald  Internship Coordinator for the Department of Economics and Business  at macdonaldbn10 vmi edu  or 540 464 7451  Honor Societies Sigma Beta

 only 9   48  are solely undergraduate degree granting institutions  That places our department in some very special company  This year was the inaugural year of a new ECBU sponsored club   the Entrepreneurship Club  An interdisciplinary group  the club had a very active first year  with several speakers and trips  With great regret we learned that Col  Francis Bush planned to retire at the end of the academic year  Francis has been a staple of the department for over 20 years  and many cadets will not likely forget the rigor and challenge of his Financial Accounting and Managerial

Bush  is retiring from the Institute after 21 years of service  When summer session closes  Col  Bush will retire after 21 years of service  Over his tenure  Col  Bush has taught a wide range of courses in the department and outside of the department  Although he will probably be remember for his help classes in principles of accounting Col  Bush has also taught statistics and calculus for Business in the Math and Computer Science Department and the Environmental Management for the Environmental Leadership minor  Col  Bush s professional and service contributions were equally diverse  Along with Col  Daley  they developed the Financial Management Concentration  He served as president of the Virginia Association of Economists  Serving in various capacities for the Institute  Col  Bush led the New Faculty Orientation at Eagles Nest and chaired the Institute s scheduling committee  The most significant contributions come from his interaction with the Corps of Cadets  From the

educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  The VMI Foundation founded and funded the Cadet Investment Group  CIG  beginning in 1986  The group s mission is to learn about the markets  stock analysis  and trading  To do this  members serve as officers  managing directors covering the major industry sectors  and as investment analysts  There are 44 cadet members  including 8 officers comprised of a Chair  Vice Chair for Education  and three teams each with a President and a Vice President  Membership is open to 1st  2nd  and 3rd class cadets in any major  Faculty advisors to the CIG are Col  Cliff West and Col  Bob Moreschi  Team A focuses on large capitalization stocks  more than  10 billion in market value  Team B invests in middle capitalization stocks  from  1 billion to  10 billion in market value  while Team C invests in small capitalization stocks  market value between  500 million and  1 billion  The groups use their own specific screening criteria  focusing on financial strength with a  value  approach  Firms on the screening list are then further analyzed  both on fundamental and technical variable  Sector analysis with a  top down  investment style is also incorporated  Members are divided into four person sector teams comprised of members from the three groups  The sector teams are tasked with providing macro analysis of their sector and making recommendations on the amount of dollars to invest in each sector  Each of the three teams is the primary micro drivers for information about individual companies and the actual analysis of stock positions to sell and new stocks to purchase  In late April 2015  the market value of the combined portfolios was almost  324 000  an increase in value of about  14 000 from April 2014  Officers in 2014 2015 were  Chairman  Chap Michie  Applied Math  Vice Chair for Education  Samuel Trumps  Econ    Bus  President Group A  large cap  Ricky Siewers  Econ    Bus

established to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  This new club aims to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies with the intent that these activities will provide cadets with the tools and resources necessary to start a business  as well as to encourage cadets to be advocates of the American free enterprise system  The club worked with two outside companies  The first  Veteran Crowd  held a competition for the best idea to increase their customer base  The VMI team won the competition earning  500 for the club  The club also created a marketing plan for NE Solite which included a presentation given to the CEO at a lunch held in the Wheat Room at VMI  The group also travelled a bit taking three trips this past year to Washington D C  Richmond  and Lynchburg  Eric Hunter   08  VMI s Career Networking Officer  organized a trip to Lynchburg where the group toured Nanoseptic  the Center for Advanced Engineering Research and Moore and Giles  the largest leather warehouse in the US  and Downtown Lynchburg  The day also included lunch with three alumni  A trip to D C  included a tour of 1776  a startup incubator  and dinner with six alumni at the Vienna Inn  In Richmond  the group attended VA Venture Summit  a daylong conference with top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the region  They also toured UnboundRVA  a startup founded by Richard Luck  12 that helps high potential individuals in low income area start businesses  This trip was funded by Craig Forbes   77  The group hosted some notable speakers including  Mike Lloyd   07   MS in Engineering from MIT  HBS grad  and CEO of startup HireProbability  Gerald Acuff   71   owner of a pharmaceutical sales company  considered one of the top American sales experts Kippur Taylor   11   attended Babson College and founded CONTAP  an app that allows you to exchange all of your contact info and social media accounts by touching 2 phones together Finally  the group initiated the Schumpeter Faculty Award  funded by the Charles Koch Foundation  which was awarded to Ricky Siewers   15 for entrepreneur of the year  Cadet Internships In the summer of 2015  eleven cadets will be participating in internships at various businesses across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  In summer 2014  six cadets with internships earned academic credit  either an economics elective or a business elective  depending on the type of work  These cadets were required to undertake a variety of academic activities  such as a reflective essay and oral presentation to the department faculty  in addition to the work of the internship  These 6 cadets worked for  Barney   Barney  insurance  risk management  employee benefits sales  Federal Emergency Management Agency  risk analysis  risk management trainee  Northwestern Mutual Insurance  insurance company  sales and management trainee  Owens   Minor  medical supply  supply chain  Recommended Media  TV commercials  production assistant  Target Corporation  retail  store management trainee  At least 11 Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2015  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well as inside our own department  Sometimes alumni are willing to mentor cadets  but this usually requires a personal relationship to happen  All of these efforts  in combination or singly  occur each year  Some of the companies who will have cadet interns this summer include  Silvercrest  Financial  NYC Cambridge Associates Franklin Templeton in St  Petersburg  FL Northrup Grummond US Army War College in Carlisle  PA  this is not an army job  Beacon Wealthcare  Raleigh  NC ProCapital Ltd  London Canal Capital Management  Richmond State Department  digital Management  John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  Laurel MD Loughridge Construction  Roanoke  VA Some cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  some will be paid  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for those cadets who are often earning salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer  or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Bruce Macdonald  Internship Coordinator for the Department of Economics and Business  at macdonaldbn10 vmi edu  or 540 464 7451  Honor Societies Sigma Beta Delta  the Honor Society for Business  and Omicron Delta Epsilon  the Economics Honor Society  were quite active this past year  thanks to cadet

Federal Reserve Bank  Students enrolled in Economics 405 for the Spring 2015 semester continued a Money and Banking class tradition by taking a field trip to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on March 10  This year s trip was organized by Bruce Summers  adjunct faculty member teaching Money and Banking  whose 33 year Fed career included many years at the Richmond Reserve Bank  While the itinerary was focused on central bank policy  regulatory  and operational responsibilities  the Reserve Bank also hosted a  meet and greet  session attended by the half dozen or so VMI alumni who now work for the Fed in Richmond  In addition  the students benefited from a conversation with Personnel Vice President Andy McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum  Memorandum of Understanding VMI has established memorandum of understanding  MOU

Travis Klein  Modern Lang    Cultures  Entrepreneurship Club A new club established to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  This new club aims to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies with the intent that these activities will provide cadets with the tools and resources necessary to start a business  as well as to encourage cadets to be advocates of the American free enterprise system  The club worked with two outside companies  The first  Veteran Crowd  held a competition for the best idea to increase their customer base  The VMI team won the competition earning  500 for the club  The club also created a marketing plan for NE Solite which included a presentation given to the CEO at a lunch held in the Wheat Room at VMI  The group also travelled a bit taking three trips this past year to Washington D C  Richmond  and Lynchburg  Eric Hunter   08  VMI s Career Networking Officer  organized a trip to Lynchburg where the group toured Nanoseptic  the Center for Advanced Engineering Research and Moore and Giles  the largest leather warehouse in the US  and Downtown Lynchburg  The day also included lunch with three alumni  A trip to D C  included a tour of 1776  a startup incubator  and dinner with six alumni at the Vienna Inn  In Richmond  the group attended VA Venture Summit  a daylong conference with top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the region  They also toured UnboundRVA  a startup founded by Richard Luck  12 that helps high potential individuals in low income area start businesses  This trip was funded by Craig Forbes   77  The group hosted some notable speakers including  Mike Lloyd   07   MS in Engineering from MIT  HBS grad  and CEO of startup HireProbability  Gerald Acuff   71   owner of a pharmaceutical sales company  considered one of the top American sales experts Kippur Taylor   11   attended Babson College and founded CONTAP  an app that allows you to exchange all of your contact info and social media accounts by touching 2 phones together Finally  the group initiated the Schumpeter Faculty Award  funded by the Charles Koch Foundation  which was awarded to Ricky Siewers   15 for entrepreneur of the year  Cadet Internships In the summer of 2015  eleven cadets will be participating in internships at various businesses across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  In summer 2014  six cadets with internships earned academic credit  either an economics elective or a business elective  depending on the type of work  These cadets were required to undertake a variety of academic activities  such as a reflective essay and oral presentation to the department faculty  in addition to the work of the internship  These 6 cadets worked for  Barney   Barney  insurance  risk management  employee benefits sales  Federal Emergency Management Agency  risk analysis  risk management trainee  Northwestern Mutual Insurance  insurance company  sales and management trainee  Owens   Minor  medical supply  supply chain  Recommended Media  TV commercials  production assistant  Target Corporation  retail  store management trainee  At least 11 Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2015  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well as inside our own department  Sometimes alumni are willing to mentor cadets  but this usually requires a personal relationship to happen  All of these efforts  in combination or singly  occur each year  Some of the companies who will have cadet interns this summer include  Silvercrest  Financial  NYC Cambridge Associates Franklin Templeton in St  Petersburg  FL Northrup Grummond US Army War College in Carlisle  PA  this is not an army job  Beacon Wealthcare  Raleigh  NC ProCapital Ltd  London Canal Capital Management  Richmond State Department  digital Management  John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  Laurel MD Loughridge Construction  Roanoke  VA Some cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  some will be paid  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for those cadets who are often earning salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer  or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Bruce Macdonald  Internship Coordinator for the Department of Economics and Business  at macdonaldbn10 vmi edu  or 540 464 7451  Honor Societies Sigma Beta Delta  the Honor Society for Business  and Omicron Delta

3 December  LTC Allen traveled with more than a dozen cadets to Richmond to tour the Federal Reserve Bank  Students enrolled in Economics 405 for the Spring 2015 semester continued a Money and Banking class tradition by taking a field trip to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on March 10  This year s trip was organized by Bruce Summers  adjunct faculty member teaching Money and Banking  whose 33 year Fed career included many years at the Richmond Reserve Bank  While the itinerary was focused on central bank policy  regulatory  and operational responsibilities  the Reserve Bank also hosted a  meet and greet  session attended by the half dozen or so VMI alumni who now work for the Fed in Richmond  In addition  the students benefited from a conversation with Personnel Vice President Andy McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum

Newsletter Spring 2015 Greetings alumni and friends  On behalf of the ECBU faculty and staff  welcome to the 9th edition of the department newsletter  Academic year 2015 2016 was  like past year s  particularly busy  In addition to the many activities and events highlighted below  probably the biggest news was our re affirmation of accreditation with the Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business  AACSB International  Accreditation review and re affirmation is required every five years  Initial accreditation occurred in late fall of 2009  so  in October of 2014  our  peer review team   PRT  visited  The faculty worked diligently the past several years to continually improve our program so as to maintain AACSB International standards in all four domains  strategic management  student participation  faculty participation  and assurance of learning  assessment  We are particularly proud of our AACSB accreditation  Only some 4  of business schools worldwide are AACSB accredited  In North America  about 30   528 as of October 2014  of all business schools are AACSB accredited  Of those 30  only 9   48  are solely undergraduate degree granting institutions  That places our department in some very special company  This year was the inaugural year of a new ECBU sponsored club   the Entrepreneurship Club  An interdisciplinary group  the club had a very active first year  with several speakers and trips  With great regret we learned that Col  Francis Bush planned to retire at the end of the academic year  Francis has been a staple of the department for over 20 years  and many cadets will not likely forget the rigor and challenge of his Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting courses  Francis  contributions and selfless devotion to cadets will not be easily replaced  We hope you will enjoy reading about the many exciting activities and accomplishments of the past academic year  Just click on the topic heading for the full

Students enrolled in Economics 405 for the Spring 2015 semester continued a Money and Banking class tradition by taking a field trip to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on March 10  This year s trip was organized by Bruce Summers  adjunct faculty member teaching Money and Banking  whose 33 year Fed career included many years at the Richmond Reserve Bank  While the itinerary was focused on central bank policy  regulatory  and operational responsibilities  the Reserve Bank also hosted a  meet and greet  session attended by the half dozen or so VMI alumni who now work for the Fed in Richmond  In addition  the students benefited from a conversation with Personnel Vice President Andy McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum  Memorandum of Understanding VMI has established memorandum of understanding  MOU  agreements with five

staff  welcome to the 9th edition of the department newsletter  Academic year 2015 2016 was  like past year s  particularly busy  In addition to the many activities and events highlighted below  probably the biggest news was our re affirmation of accreditation with the Association for the Advancement of Collegiate Schools of Business  AACSB International  Accreditation review and re affirmation is required every five years  Initial accreditation occurred in late fall of 2009  so  in October of 2014  our  peer review team   PRT  visited  The faculty worked diligently the past several years to continually improve our program so as to maintain AACSB International standards in all four domains  strategic management  student participation  faculty participation  and assurance of learning  assessment  We are particularly proud of our AACSB accreditation  Only some 4  of business schools worldwide are AACSB accredited  In North America  about 30   528 as of October 2014  of all business schools are AACSB accredited  Of those 30  only 9   48  are solely undergraduate degree granting institutions  That places our department in some very special company  This year was the inaugural year of a new ECBU sponsored club   the Entrepreneurship Club  An interdisciplinary group  the club had a very active first year  with several speakers and trips  With great regret we learned that Col  Francis Bush planned to retire at the end of the academic year  Francis has been a staple of the department for over 20 years  and many cadets will not likely forget the rigor and challenge of his Financial Accounting and Managerial Accounting courses  Francis  contributions and selfless devotion to cadets will not be easily replaced  We hope you will enjoy reading about the many exciting activities and accomplishments of the past academic year  Just click on the topic heading for the full story  Best Regards  Col  Bob Moreschi Department Head Colonel Francis Bush We are sad to see that our friend and colleague  Francis Bush  is retiring from the Institute after 21 years of service  When summer session closes  Col  Bush will retire after 21 years of service  Over his tenure  Col  Bush has taught a wide range of courses in the department and outside of the department  Although he will probably be remember for his help classes in principles of accounting Col  Bush has also taught statistics and calculus for Business in the Math and Computer Science Department and the Environmental Management for the Environmental Leadership minor  Col  Bush s professional and service contributions were equally diverse  Along with Col  Daley  they developed the Financial Management Concentration  He served as president of the Virginia Association of Economists  Serving in various capacities for the Institute  Col  Bush led the New Faculty Orientation at Eagles Nest and chaired the Institute s scheduling committee  The most significant contributions come from his interaction with the Corps of Cadets  From the start  Col  Bush took advantage of the numerous opportunities  From breaking out with and becoming an honorary  BR  of the Class of 1998 until serving as the class adviser to 2015  Col  Bush has served as adviser to numerous clubs from VMI Theatre and the Marathon Club to Men in Grey and the cadet Publications Board  He also took advantage of various opportunities with the ROTC programs  including attending Air Force ROTC for four years with the Class of 2008  Good luck in your future  Faculty Activity Our faculty has been hard at work publishing research in academic journals as well as presenting their research at various conferences around the country and the world   Lt  Col Sam Allen Undergraduate research Renee Reives  Brandon Goodwyn

between  500 million and  1 billion  The groups use their own specific screening criteria  focusing on financial strength with a  value  approach  Firms on the screening list are then further analyzed  both on fundamental and technical variable  Sector analysis with a  top down  investment style is also incorporated  Members are divided into four person sector teams comprised of members from the three groups  The sector teams are tasked with providing macro analysis of their sector and making recommendations on the amount of dollars to invest in each sector  Each of the three teams is the primary micro drivers for information about individual companies and the actual analysis of stock positions to sell and new stocks to purchase  In late April 2015  the market value of the combined portfolios was almost  324 000  an increase in value of about  14 000 from April 2014  Officers in 2014 2015 were  Chairman  Chap Michie  Applied Math  Vice Chair for Education  Samuel Trumps  Econ

McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum

comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  The VMI Foundation founded and funded the Cadet Investment Group  CIG  beginning in 1986  The group s mission is to learn about the markets  stock analysis  and trading  To do this  members serve as officers  managing directors covering the major industry sectors  and as investment analysts  There are 44 cadet members  including 8 officers comprised of a Chair  Vice Chair for Education  and three teams each with a President and a Vice President  Membership is open to 1st  2nd  and 3rd class cadets in any major  Faculty advisors to the CIG are Col  Cliff West and Col  Bob Moreschi  Team A focuses on large capitalization stocks  more than  10 billion in market value  Team B invests in middle capitalization stocks  from  1 billion to  10 billion in market value  while Team C invests in small capitalization stocks  market value between  500 million and  1 billion  The groups use their own specific screening criteria  focusing on financial strength with a  value  approach  Firms on the screening list are then further analyzed  both on fundamental and technical variable  Sector analysis with a  top down  investment style is also incorporated  Members are divided into four person sector teams comprised of members from the three groups  The sector teams are tasked with providing macro analysis of their sector and making recommendations on the amount of dollars to invest in each sector  Each of the three teams is the primary micro drivers for information about individual companies and the actual analysis of stock positions to sell and new stocks to purchase  In late April 2015  the market value of the combined portfolios was almost  324 000  an increase in value of about  14 000 from April 2014  Officers in 2014 2015 were  Chairman  Chap Michie  Applied Math  Vice Chair for Education  Samuel Trumps  Econ

Travis Klein  Modern Lang    Cultures  Entrepreneurship Club A new club established to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies  This new club aims to provide cadets with comprehensive knowledge on entrepreneurship through an educational guest speaker curriculum  trips and conferences  and projects for companies with the intent that these activities will provide cadets with the tools and resources necessary to start a business  as well as to encourage cadets to be advocates of the American free enterprise system  The club worked with two outside companies  The first  Veteran Crowd  held a competition for the best idea to increase their customer base  The VMI team won the competition earning  500 for the club  The club also created a marketing plan for NE Solite which included a presentation given to the CEO at a lunch held in the Wheat Room at VMI  The group also travelled a bit taking three trips this past year to Washington D C  Richmond  and Lynchburg  Eric Hunter   08  VMI s Career Networking Officer  organized a trip to Lynchburg where the group toured Nanoseptic  the Center for Advanced Engineering Research and Moore and Giles  the largest leather warehouse in the US  and Downtown Lynchburg  The day also included lunch with three alumni  A trip to D C  included a tour of 1776  a startup incubator  and dinner with six alumni at the Vienna Inn  In Richmond  the group attended VA Venture Summit  a daylong conference with top entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in the region  They also toured UnboundRVA  a startup founded by Richard Luck  12 that helps high potential individuals in low income area start businesses  This trip was funded by Craig Forbes   77  The group hosted some notable speakers including  Mike Lloyd   07   MS in Engineering from MIT  HBS grad  and CEO of startup HireProbability  Gerald Acuff   71   owner of a pharmaceutical sales company  considered one of the top American sales experts Kippur Taylor   11   attended Babson College and founded CONTAP  an app that allows you to exchange all of your contact info and social media accounts by touching 2 phones together Finally  the group initiated the Schumpeter Faculty Award  funded by the Charles Koch Foundation  which was awarded to Ricky Siewers   15 for entrepreneur of the year  Cadet Internships In the summer of 2015  eleven cadets will be participating in internships at various businesses across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  In summer 2014  six cadets with internships earned academic credit  either an economics elective or a business elective  depending on the type of work  These cadets were required to undertake a variety of academic activities  such as a reflective essay and oral presentation to the department faculty  in addition to the work of the internship  These 6 cadets worked for  Barney   Barney  insurance  risk management  employee benefits sales  Federal Emergency Management Agency  risk analysis  risk management trainee  Northwestern Mutual Insurance  insurance company  sales and management trainee  Owens   Minor  medical supply  supply chain  Recommended Media  TV commercials  production assistant  Target Corporation  retail  store management trainee  At least 11 Economics and Business majors will be performing summer internships in the summer of 2015  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well as inside our own department  Sometimes alumni are willing to mentor cadets  but this usually requires a personal relationship to happen  All of these efforts  in combination or singly  occur each year  Some of the companies who will have cadet interns this summer include  Silvercrest  Financial  NYC Cambridge Associates Franklin Templeton in St  Petersburg  FL Northrup Grummond US Army War College in Carlisle  PA  this is not an army job  Beacon Wealthcare  Raleigh  NC ProCapital Ltd  London Canal Capital Management  Richmond State Department  digital Management  John Hopkins Applied Physics Lab  Laurel MD Loughridge Construction  Roanoke  VA Some cadets will also be earning academic credit for their internship  some will be paid  These cadets have academic requirements including setting learning objectives and weekly logs during the summer  and then writing a paper and giving a presentation to EC BU faculty when they return in the fall  It s a win win situation for those cadets who are often earning salaries and also earning economic or business elective credits  If you are willing to mentor a cadet who is looking for an internship next summer  or if you know of any internship opportunities  please contact Bruce Macdonald  Internship Coordinator for the Department of Economics and Business  at macdonaldbn10 vmi edu  or 540 464 7451  Honor Societies Sigma Beta Delta  the Honor Society for Business  and Omicron Delta

across the country  Some of these cadets are also doing the associated academic work required to earn business or economic elective credits for their internships  In summer 2014  six cadets with internships earned academic credit  either an economics elective or a business elective  depending on the type of work  These cadets were required to undertake a variety of academic activities  such as a reflective essay and oral presentation to the department faculty  in addition to the work of the internship  These 6 cadets worked for  Barney   Barney  insurance  risk management  employee

internships in the summer of 2015  Good internships are hard to find these days  although the situation is improving as both the national mood and the economy improves  A major factor is competition from students at other colleges  Success often depends on cadets pursuing internships opportunities with energy and imagination  Utilizing the VMI alumni network is one way  another is thinking outside the box by looking for opportunities in less obvious places  Cadets are fortunate to have several networking opportunities open to them by the Alumni Associations and Career Services  as well

more than a dozen cadets to Richmond to tour the Federal Reserve Bank  Students enrolled in Economics 405 for the Spring 2015 semester continued a Money and Banking class tradition by taking a field trip to the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond on March 10  This year s trip was organized by Bruce Summers  adjunct faculty member teaching Money and Banking  whose 33 year Fed career included many years at the Richmond Reserve Bank  While the itinerary was focused on central bank policy  regulatory  and operational responsibilities  the Reserve Bank also hosted a  meet and greet  session attended by the half dozen or so VMI alumni who now work for the Fed in Richmond  In addition  the students benefited from a conversation with Personnel Vice President Andy McAllister about the Fed s hiring policies and what the Reserve Bank looks for in prospective employees just out of college   an especially meaningful conversation as Andy is also a VMI alumnus  The visit began with a talk by the Reserve Bank s monetary and macro economist  who spoke about the Federal Reserve s strategy for exiting from unconventional monetary policy and the resumption of normal monetary policy   a topic of keen interest to the Money and Banking class  The class also toured the Reserve Bank s vaults and saw firsthand how the Fed meets public demand for currency by working with the banking system  Additional operational insight was provided by the Fed s chief technology officer  who engaged the class in conversation about technology requirements for mission critical functions on which the banking system depends  including money transfer systems and protection of the Fed s  electronic vaults  The administration of the Discount Window and related lending and collateral programs were also addressed by a member of the supervision  regulation  and credit function  The Richmond Reserve Bank s staff tailored the day s educational program to fit well with the Department s Money and Banking curriculum  Further  the Reserve Bank staff was gracious and accommodating throughout  including hosting a fine lunch in the Reserve Bank s dining room  We were welcomed back for another visit by Mark Mullinix  the Reserve Bank s First Vice President and Chief Operating Officer  We hope to make another trip as part of the Fall 2015 Money and Banking curriculum Richmond Federal Reserve Bank Field
