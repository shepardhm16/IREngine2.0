  Alumni Appeal Stonewall Jackson at VMI Society of Alumni controversy Stonewall Jackson at VMI top level  In the spring of 1856  members of the VMI Society of Alumni responded to mounting criticism of Jackson s teaching skills  They presented to the Board of Visitors a petition to have Jackson removed from office  which the Board promptly tabled without discussion  Jackson was unaware of this controversy until a year later  and no action was ever taken by the Board  Superintendent Francis H  Smith  in an attempt to look objectively at the controversy  contacted James T  Murfee  a respected graduate who stood first in his class in 1853 and had studied under Major Jackson  Murfee was employed as a professor of mathematics at a college in Lynchburg  Virginia  August 7  1856  Excerpt  Murfee to VMI Superintendent Francis H  Smith  The matter of Maj  Jackson s Professorship was brought up on the morning of the 4th  July  by a very worthy member of the Alumni  he being actuated as I supposed and feel assured of  by the same motives of interest in the Institute as I was in all I did and said  And in all this matter I wish to be understood as having the greatest regard for Major Jackson as a man such regard  indeed  as would make it  as it is  a matter of very great regret to me to say or do anything that would ever tend to injure his feelings  for I give him credit for all the good qualities that you do  Now at the same time that I have these opinions of him in regard to the purity of his motives  I know that he did not  nor has not done as far as I can learn  anything like justice to his department  and from the same opinion on the part of many  it seems that the Institute is suffering much  indeed  but for this consideration  and my acquaintance with him as a Professor  I should not have been in favor of the action of the Alumni  but as it was  I was much in favor of it  and desire the evil may be remedied with as little injury to Major Jackson and with as much credit to the VMI as possible  and this was expressed as the desire of the Alumni  You are pleased to refer to my success to prove that the Alumni are mistaken in their views  But a reference to the many difficulties I have had to contend with in my experience  proves most conclusively that I was less prepared to teach Nat  Philosophy than anything else  and it has been the greatest task I ever had  to save my reputation and that of the Institute  and if I have succeeded in it  it has been only by dent of study and application  that have cost me a great deal of health and capital  You seem to conclude that my preparation in Nat  Philosophy was as good as that in Mathematics  but Sir  allow me to say  that in so far as any qualifications to be Prof  of these Departments  there is was no more comparison  than these is between the merest tyro in any study and the best scholar  You  Sir  are Prof  of Math and knew my qualifications for this chair  but you knew very little if anything  in regard to my qualifications to teach Nat  Philosophy  As to the importance of the use of instruments in teaching Natural Philosophy I would about as soon study watch making without a watch and instruments  as I would study  as I did at the VMI  Nat  Phil  without an apparatus When an apparatus is at hand  there is no excuse for a Prof  if he does not give his classes the use of it  be the labor what it may You consider it very important to have your classes instructed in the principles and use of Mathematical Instruments  and certainly this is not so important as the whole course of Philosophical Instruments  You think Maj  Jackson is improving  and so do I think he has done and is doing all he can  but if he could ever make himself capable of filling that chair as it should be then I know no principle  by which to judge of a man s talents  All this I can say without great discredit to Maj  J  for in such an Institution as yours  it requires much more than an ordinary man such a one as has very few if any superiors in the country  In this day of science the Chairs of Chemistry and Natural Philosophy are the most important  and I want to see the VMI leading the country in these things  and I am pleased to know she is  or bids fair to do it in the Department of Chemistry  The VMI has directed the attention of the country towards herself on acct  of the superiority of her Profs  of Math  and some kindred subjects  and in connection with these the learned world expects great merit in the department of Natural Philosophy  Now unless this merit can be seen  the Institute must suffer beyond any calculation  I have now availed myself of saying to you about all I have ever said  and that I have said only in the meeting of the Alumni  It was the expressed understanding in that body that this thing was to be managed as delicately as possible  I would blush to make such facts known to strangers  Had I had no interest in the VMI  I should for personal consideration  wish to consign such thought as these to oblivion as possible  Maj  Jackson has been  I suppose  informed of these things by authority of the Alumni  and hence as a member of that body  I can express to you my views as presented to the Alumni  You may  if you deem it necessary  show him this communication  for although I am anxious to save his feelings and reputation  I say or do nothing against a man that I am not perfectly willing an anxious for him to know  I did what I thought my duty and now I rest perfectly contented to leave the matter to proper authority  for as I said before  on account of personal respect  I shall say no more of a subject so disagreeable to think of  VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX
