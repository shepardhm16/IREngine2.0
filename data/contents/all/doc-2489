with Talk by Mythbusters  Imahara Lexington  Va  Oct  7  2014   Television personality and robotics guru Grant Imahara kicked off the 2014 STEM education conference at Virginia Military Institute earlier today with a high energy presentation designed to show elementary and middle school teachers how to make science and engineering more appealing to students  Imahara is best known for his recently ended 10 season run on the Emmy nominated show Mythbusters  The reality show is designed to test urban myths  Over the past decade  Imahara and his fellow cast members have tackled a wide variety of experiments  among them catching a greased pig  testing the lethality of an exploding lava lamp  and making a candle from earwax  Since 2012  the Center for Leadership and Ethics at VMI has hosted a conference each fall having to do with the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering and mathematics  This year s conference  which has drawn nearly 300 participants from across Virginia  is titled   Engineering Ingenuity  Math and Science Concepts in Action  During his talk  the 43 year old Imahara demonstrated a number of those concepts in action as he played both still photos and video clips from Mythbusters and talked about what s made the show  now in its 13th season  so popular among young audiences  Imahara began his remarks with a slide announcing   How to Make Science and Engineering Cool  and then immediately drew laughs from the capacity crowd of educators  VMI faculty  and cadets as he quickly followed it with another slide reading   How We Accidentally Made Science and Engineering Cool  Mythbusters has found an audience its producers didn t know it would have  Imahara noted   The interesting thing about our show  he said   is that when it began  it set out not particularly to be a science education show and it set out not particularly to be a show that appeals to kids  yet somehow  through some magical combination  it achieves both  He added   We like to say that we wrap our science in a delicious candy coating of explosions and car crashes  And that way  kids  well  they eat it up  Imahara then devoted the rest of his remarks to explaining the appeal of the show  None of the cast members are scientists  he noted  and one  Adam Savage  has only a high school education  Imahara s own background is in electrical engineering  which has made him a key player on the Mythbusters build team  alongside Tory Bellici and Kari Byron  Also  the cast members truly don t know where their experiments will take them  Imahara observed   The audience follows along with us  he said   Our discovery is their discovery  What s more  he noted  Mythbusters chooses topics that almost anyone can relate to  Incredibly  Imahara commented  the first duct tape special on Mythbusters became the most watched episode in the history of the show   and prompted two more episodes  including one in which the cast members successfully attempt to lift a car with duct tape   Duct tape is something that s relatable  said Imahara  who spent nine years working for George Lucas  Industrial Light and Magic  with multiple movie credits to his name  before joining the cast of Mythbusters in 2005  Imahara is also one of three people in the United States authorized to work on the Star Wars robot R2 D2 and has helped to animate the Energizer Bunny  In the realm of science education  ditching one s dignity at the door can also be required  as the Mythbusters cast has demonstrated time and time again in attempts  for instance  not only to catch greased pigs  but also to herd cats  the latter with little success   Teaching science with a little bit of humor helps out tremendously  Imahara said  Other factors   including a willingness to be wrong and accept error  an ability to delve into the gross  smelly  and sometimes slimy  and a big budget for explosives   have helped drive the success of Mythbusters  but according to Imahara  the key word is excitement   We know science is exciting  he continued   At its very essence  what we do is science  If you can capture that excitement  I think it will help you out tremendously    It s a great time to be in science education  For all of us  science is the key to securing our future  A focus on STEM education will benefit the entire nation  said Capt  Catherine Roy  communications specialist at

personality Grant Imahara addressed teachers  VMI faculty  and cadets earlier today    VMI Photo by Kevin Remington  STEM Conference Opens with Talk by Mythbusters  Imahara Lexington  Va  Oct  7  2014   Television personality and robotics guru Grant Imahara kicked off the 2014 STEM education conference at Virginia Military Institute earlier today with a high energy presentation designed to show elementary and middle school teachers how to make science and engineering more appealing to students  Imahara is best known for his recently ended 10 season run on the Emmy nominated show Mythbusters  The reality show is designed to test urban myths  Over the past decade  Imahara and his fellow cast members have tackled a wide variety of experiments  among them catching a greased pig  testing the lethality of an exploding lava lamp  and making a candle from earwax  Since 2012  the Center for Leadership and Ethics at VMI has hosted a conference each fall having to do with the STEM fields of science  technology  engineering and mathematics  This year s conference  which has drawn nearly 300 participants from across Virginia  is titled   Engineering Ingenuity  Math and Science Concepts in Action  During his talk  the 43 year old Imahara demonstrated a number of those concepts in action as he played both still photos and video clips from Mythbusters and talked about what s made the show  now in its 13th season  so popular among young audiences  Imahara began his remarks with a slide announcing   How to Make Science and Engineering Cool  and then immediately drew laughs from the capacity crowd of educators  VMI faculty  and cadets as he quickly followed it with another slide reading   How We Accidentally Made Science and Engineering Cool  Mythbusters has found an audience its producers didn t know it would have  Imahara noted   The interesting thing about our show  he said   is that when it began  it set out not particularly to be a science education show and it set out not particularly to be a show that appeals to kids  yet somehow  through some magical combination  it achieves both  He added   We like to say that we wrap our science in a delicious candy coating of explosions and car crashes  And that way  kids  well  they eat it up  Imahara then devoted the rest of his remarks to explaining the appeal of the show  None of the cast members are scientists  he noted  and one  Adam Savage  has only a high school education  Imahara s own background is in electrical engineering  which has made him a key player on the Mythbusters build team  alongside Tory Bellici and Kari Byron  Also  the cast members truly don t know where their experiments will take them  Imahara observed   The audience follows along with us  he said   Our discovery is their discovery  What s more  he noted  Mythbusters chooses topics that almost anyone can relate to  Incredibly  Imahara commented  the first duct tape special on Mythbusters became the most watched episode in the history of the show   and prompted two more episodes  including one in which the cast members successfully attempt to lift a car with duct tape   Duct tape is something that s relatable  said Imahara  who spent nine years working for George Lucas  Industrial Light and Magic  with multiple movie credits to his name  before joining the cast of Mythbusters in 2005  Imahara is also one of three people in the United States authorized to work on the Star Wars robot R2 D2 and has helped to animate the Energizer Bunny  In the realm of science education  ditching one s dignity at the door can also be required  as the Mythbusters cast has demonstrated time and time again in attempts  for instance  not only to catch greased pigs  but also to herd cats  the latter with little success   Teaching science with a little bit of humor helps out tremendously  Imahara said  Other factors   including a willingness to be wrong and accept error  an ability to delve into the gross  smelly  and sometimes slimy  and a big budget for explosives   have helped drive the success of Mythbusters  but according to Imahara  the key word is excitement   We know science is exciting  he continued   At its very essence  what we do is science  If you can capture that excitement  I think it will help you out tremendously    It s a great time to be in science education  For all of us  science is the key to securing our future  A focus on STEM education will benefit the entire nation  said Capt  Catherine Roy  communications specialist at the Center for Leadership and Ethics   This STEM conference is important to VMI because STEM education is a highly important topic for our nation  Roy commented  This year s STEM conference concludes Wednesday  Oct  8  with a variety of workshop sessions and a
