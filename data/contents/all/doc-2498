Rover a True Collaborative Effort Tick Rover a True Collaborative Effort  This summer s successful test of the  tick rover  robot was a significant milestone in a nine year collaboration involving professors from three schools representing four disciplines  The project started back in 2004 when three ideas came together with three people  Col  Dave Livingston  a professor of electrical and computer engineering  had just returned from a robotics contest with a toy tank chassis he had purchased for Col  Jim Squire  a colleague in the department  Thinking of his own child s safety  Squire wanted to use the chassis to design a robot to kill ticks  Livingston suggested they talk to Dr  Dan Sonenshine of Old Dominion University s biological sciences department  and two things happened  First  the project went from a fun idea too expensive to take seriously to an affordable  practical device inspired by that toy tank chassis  Second  the project became both interdisciplinary and highly collaborative  It became a development project with a strong undergraduate research dimension  Early brainstorming focused on vision systems to find ticks and something to zap them or squish them with   it focused  as engineers will  on the machine  Sonenshine suggested they take into account the organism they were trying to outsmart  through biomimicry   That s how we got the idea of not chasing the ticks  said Livingston   but of having the ticks chase us  The device is essentially an autonomous vehicle that drags a denim cloth treated with permethrin insecticide  The system exudes carbon dioxide  which for ticks is a chemoattractant  Sonenshine pointed out that ticks are programmed to go after any chemoattractant that s moving   Instead of having to have a million dollar thing  all you need is this thing to drag a cloth  said Col  Jay Sullivan  VMI professor of mechanical engineering  who joined the project as it moved from brainstorming to design   That  added Sullivan   takes the technology from something that only NSF  National Science Foundation  could fund to something I can sell to someone for their backyard  In the years since 2004  two more professors have joined the team  Elizabeth Baker  who was a professor in VMI s economics and business department at the time but is now a specialist in entrepreneurship at Wake Forest University  and Holly Gaff  a math modeling specialist in ODU s biological science department  Developing an invention like the tick rover is a long term project requiring work after teaching responsibilities have been met  which means after hours  Interdisciplinary approaches allow professors to make the best possible use of their very valuable investment of time   If you look at the robot  nothing on it was extremely difficult  but everything took a lot of time  said Sullivan  who designed the robot s gas distribution system   The nice thing with these collaborations is you re going to hit some low lying fruit    Having that extra expertise    you get that elegant solution  You get something you didn t expect  The biologists from ODU added a whole different kind of thinking   We do more research and development work  like they do in industry  than basic research  said Livingston  Not so  Gaff and her team of biological science students  To complete the independent testing  they created with an experimental design with controls   They were testing the hypothesis  they culled out as many variables as they could  They re biologists  and this is what they do  said Sullivan  noting that from the engineering perspective the money to fund the control  which of course was never expected to produce any results  was a waste  Gaff  he said  told him flat out she didn t think it would work  And when the first results came in with a kill rate between 75 and 90 percent  Gaff reviewed her experimental protocol  assuming there was an error  She found nothing wrong  however  and the next test came in at 100 percent  Baker  said Livingston  had confidence in the project from the beginning  The development work  getting the robot to do what you expect it to do  is the fun part for the engineers  said Livingston  who designed the navigation system  But that doesn t get an invention to market  Baker and her students have added an essential element   We all like to build stuff  said Sullivan of the engineers   You get to the point where  you say   OK  I built it  it works  Now what do we do  The patents  the paperwork  the calls   that s the stuff that s no fun  She  Baker  has been excellent at finding the right people to call   to get the additional resources for us to do further and further development that wouldn t have happened otherwise   We re in the product engineering stage now  said Livingston   You take some of the problems that they had with the last set of tests and fix those problems  And that s where students  especially cadets  come back into the equation  In the years since 2004  12 cadets in three departments  graduate students from both ODU and Wake Forest  one home schooler  and an undergraduate from Washington and Lee University have worked on   and learned from   the project  Lab work is extremely important for the cadet learning experience  said Squire   Students have different abilities  Some students show tremendous ability in a lab  even if they don t perform as well in testing situations  For the tick rover  cadets have worked on navigation programming  solid modeling  prototyping  fabrication  testing  design  and 3 D modeling  In the lab  students are solving real problems  though Squire said he sometimes must correct their designs   I guide them through the project  he said   By designing the 250 parts  of the tick rover bay station  they ll get it right with maybe four errors  but they get all the learning  They get all the experience from it but without the frustration  By   Sherri Tombarge IR   Sept  2013 VMI
