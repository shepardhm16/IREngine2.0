endanger us here  or the safety of Gen Lee s army  On the 9th inst a dispatch was received from General Breckinridge informing the Supt that Genl  Sigel was advancing up the valley and urging the

of the gallant dead who have fallen in defending their country against the invasion of a ruthless foe  The newspapers have furnished you with accounts of the victory gained by Gen  Breckinridge over Sigel near New Market  and every notice of the fight bgears unequivocal testimony to the value of the aid rendered by the Corps of Cadets and the  illegible  valour that they displayed in the action  You have also received  I suppose  an official letter from the Adjutant informing you of the sad event  I can add nothing more except the statement that the fatal ball passed entirely through his body  entering a little to the  illegible  of the breastbone and coming out on the left of the spine  passing probably through the heart  so that it may be concluded that his death was instantaneous  This I received from Col  Gilham who examined the body before its interment  I have not been able to see anyone who was near him when he fell  as the cadets have not returned to the Institute   having been  ordered to Richmond  The Quartermaster will endeavor to preserve any mementos or any property of the cadets who have fallen  but cannot at present while the Corps is absent identify what belongs to each  The letter which you gave me for him  3 words illegible  and which weighed as a heavy burden on my heart after I heard before I reached home  that the words of affection it contained could never reach the eyes closed in death forever together with a second one received from the office for him  I have directed to be kept subject to your order not choosing to subject them to the risk of the mail in the present uncertainty of transmission  I offer no words of condolence  I know how to sympathize with you for my noblest son fell slain in battle not two months after he left the Institute and I know by experience that the only comfort for so great a sorrow must come from a source higher than any on earth  Yrs truly J T L  Preston VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My

rendered by the Corps of Cadets and the  illegible  valour that they displayed in the action  You have also received  I suppose  an official letter from the Adjutant informing you of the sad event  I can add nothing more except the statement that the fatal ball passed entirely through his body  entering a little to the  illegible  of the breastbone and coming out on the left of the spine  passing probably through the heart  so that it may be concluded that his death was instantaneous  This I received from Col  Gilham who examined the body before its interment  I have not been able to see anyone who was near him when he fell  as the cadets have not returned to the Institute   having been  ordered to Richmond  The Quartermaster will endeavor to preserve any mementos or any property of the cadets who have fallen  but cannot at present while the Corps is absent identify what belongs to each  The letter which you gave me for him  3 words illegible  and which weighed as a heavy burden on my heart after I heard before I reached home  that the words of affection it contained could never reach the eyes closed in death forever together with a second one received from the office for him  I have directed to be kept subject to your order not choosing to subject them to the risk of the mail in the present uncertainty of transmission  I offer no words of condolence  I know how to

can add nothing more except the statement that the fatal ball passed entirely through his body  entering a little to the  illegible  of the breastbone and coming out on the left of the spine  passing probably through the heart  so that it may be concluded that his death was instantaneous  This I received from Col  Gilham who examined the body before its interment  I have not been able to see anyone who was near him when he fell  as the cadets have not returned to the Institute   having been  ordered to Richmond  The Quartermaster will endeavor to preserve any mementos or any property of the cadets who have fallen  but cannot at present while the Corps is absent identify what belongs to each  The letter which you gave me for him  3 words illegible  and which weighed as a heavy burden on my heart after I heard before I reached home  that the words of affection it contained could never reach the eyes closed in death forever together with a second one received from the office for him  I have directed to be kept subject to your order not choosing to subject them to the risk of the mail in the present uncertainty of transmission  I offer no words of condolence  I know how to

run on the North River Canal  I am not sure whether a deck boat will be best for my purpose or not or whether it may not be better to buy an open boat which is so arranged as to be closed in  I will explain to you what I desire to use such a boat for and then you can judge better than I can  I may have to transport Artillery  say from Richmond or Lynchburg to this place  or the reverse  or

state or of the Confederate states  When not running on their duties  she may be employed as a general freight boat  I should like to get a boat equipped fully    fitted to run as soon as possible  and if possible to get a reliable Captain to whom I would be willing to pay the customary rates  As I have said above  you will be best able to judge what kind of boat will suit me best and I now

of the gallant dead who have fallen in defending their country against the invasion of a ruthless foe  The newspapers have furnished you with accounts of the victory gained by Gen  Breckinridge over Sigel near New Market  and every notice of the fight bgears unequivocal testimony to the value of the aid rendered by the Corps of Cadets and the  illegible  valour that they displayed in the action  You have also received  I suppose  an official letter from the Adjutant informing you of the sad event  I can add nothing more except the statement that the fatal ball passed entirely through his body  entering a little to the  illegible  of the breastbone and coming out on the left of the spine  passing probably through the heart  so that it may be concluded that his death was instantaneous  This I received from Col  Gilham who examined the body before its interment  I have not been able to see anyone who was near him when he fell  as the cadets have not returned to the Institute   having been  ordered to Richmond  The Quartermaster will endeavor to preserve any mementos or any property of the cadets who have fallen  but cannot at present while the Corps is absent identify what belongs to each  The letter which you gave me for him  3 words illegible  and which weighed as a heavy burden on my heart after I heard before I reached home  that the words of affection it contained could never reach the eyes closed in death forever together with a second one received from the office for him  I have directed to be kept subject to your order not choosing to subject them to the risk of the mail in the present uncertainty of transmission  I offer no words of condolence  I know how to sympathize with you for my noblest son fell slain in battle not two months after he left the Institute and I know by experience that the only comfort for so great a sorrow must come from a source higher than any on earth  Yrs truly J T L  Preston Archives   Records   Superintendents   Outgoing  1864

Henry J  JonesHQ   V M  Institute May 18th  1864 J L  Jones Charlotte  NC Sir  I am directed by the Supt to inform you  that acting under the suggestions and instructions of General R E  Lee and the Governor of Virginia  the Corps of Cadets was made subject to the orders of General Breckinridge to cooperate with him if at any time a threatened advance of the enemy might either endanger us here  or the safety of Gen Lee s army May 18  1864 Death of Cadet Henry J  Jones May 18  1864 Death of Cadet Henry J  Jones      On the 9th inst a dispatch was received from General Breckinridge informing the Supt that Genl  Sigel was advancing up the valley and urging the immediate junction of the cadets with his command at Staunton  This order was promptly obeyed  and resulted in a general victory over the enemy on the 15th inst near New Market in which the cadets bore an important and conspicuous part I regret to inform you that your brother  Henry Jenner Jones  VMI Class of 1867  was killed  Five cadets were killed and thirty seven wounded  Your brother s remains were interred  together with the others  in the cemetery at New Market on the evening of the 16th inst  His grave is so marked that there will be no difficulty in distinguishing it if at any time you should desire to have his remains removed Providence has so ordained it that these young men should be sent off in early youth they fell nobly fighting in a just cause  in which all Sourthern youths are willing to pour out  their  heart s blood  I am sir  Very respectfully  yr obt servt J H  Morrison  A A  V M I   May 25  1864 Death of Cadet William H  McDowellVirginia Mil  Institute May 25th  1864 Mr  R I  McDowell Mount Mourne  Iredell Co  N C  Sir  You have doubtless received before this the mournful intelligence that your  noble  son has been added to the long list of the gallant dead who have fallen in defending their country against the invasion of a ruthless foe  The newspapers have furnished you with accounts of the victory gained by Gen  Breckinridge over Sigel near New Market  and every notice of the fight bgears unequivocal testimony to the value of the aid rendered by the Corps of Cadets and the  illegible  valour that they displayed in the action  You have also received  I suppose  an official letter from the Adjutant informing you of the sad event May 25  1864 Death of Cadet William H  McDowell May 25  1864 Death of Cadet William H  McDowell      I can add nothing more except the statement that the fatal ball passed entirely through his body  entering a little to the  illegible  of the breastbone and coming out on the left of the spine  passing probably through the heart  so that it may be concluded that his death was instantaneous This I received from Col  Gilham who examined the body before its interment  I have not been able to see anyone who was near him when he fell  as the cadets have not returned to the Institute   having been  ordered to Richmond The Quartermaster will endeavor to preserve any mementos or any property of the cadets who have fallen  but cannot at present while the Corps is absent identify what belongs to each  The letter which you gave me for him  3 words illegible  and which weighed as a heavy burden on my heart after I heard before I reached home  that the words of affection it contained could never reach the eyes closed in death forever together with a second one received from the office for him  I have directed to be kept subject to your order not choosing to subject them to the risk of the mail in the present uncertainty of transmission I offer no words of condolence  I know how to sympathize with you for my noblest son fell slain in battle not two months after he left the Institute and I know by experience that the only comfort for so great a sorrow must come from a source higher than any on earth  Yrs truly J T L  Preston   VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI VMI Foundation Keydet Club
