Results Interfacing with engineers at NASA s Langley Research Center is an opportunity not afforded most undergraduates  but four 1st Class cadets under the direction of Col  Joe Blandino  professor of mechanical engineering  have been able to do just that  NASA engineers assisted Luke Butler as he worked on his honors thesis  while Paul Cicero  Kelvin Ulloa  and Victor de Leon completed a year long senior design project  Their work even led to VMI s involvement in a successful proposal resulting in a NASA Phase I Small Business Innovative Research Grant to a computer aided engineering   simulation   company  MotionPort  with which Blandino is collaborating on software design tools for spacecraft hardware   Normally our senior design course is one semester  but the group wanted to work on a project that was more challenging than could be accomplished during the semester  said Blandino   I hope what we can come up with is a well understood and well designed solar array that industry could pick up  integrate into a space craft  and send   off on at least a Mars flyby in the next 10 years  he explained  Solar arrays capture sunlight and turn it into energy for solar electric propulsion   I was six years old when man walked on the moon and the next logical step was   We re heading to Mars  and that never happened    But I think maybe the time is coming where that is going to happen  Blandino continued  The research these cadets completed will be one of thousands of critical pieces in the bigger picture of that mission to Mars   My project was taking the GRA   Government Reference Array   and seeing if it was scalable up to a one megawatt class solar array structure  which means it s going to have to support 5 000 square meters of solar blankets in outer space  said Butler  who is entering the Engineering Science and Mechanics doctoral program at Virginia Tech   Our project focused more on the actual deployable system that they use to deploy the solar blankets as soon as the satellite is launched into space said Ulloa  who commissioned in the U S  Marine Corps   We were taking a closer look at what stresses the hinges and other structures are going to be experiencing during deployment   determining if the keel  primary structural  beams sustained any failures in the hinges  explained Cicero  who commissioned in the U S  Air Force and will continue working in space operations in the Satellite Command and Control division   Langley allowed us to use some of their systems and some of their processing capabilities because the programs we were running   required a lot of processing power  Cicero continued   At VMI  we only have a limited amount  so they were providing a lot more capabilities at our disposal as well as troubleshooting technical help  Last fall  NASA issued requests for proposals under the Small Business Innovative Research program   One of the topics was related to developing software tools for designing future large solar arrays  Blandino explained  Since this is a fairly new area for MotionPort  the company sought out Blandino s expertise  Staff there knew he had been running simulations using the company s software and that he was active in the spacecraft community working on deployable structures   We ll be using the toolboxes they ve developed for their RecurDyn multi body dynamic modeling software  and we ll be giving them feedback as well as providing documentation on the use  Blandino said  VMI will receive three  49 000 licenses for cadet use   We re hoping if this is successful that NASA would choose this for Phase II   there s much more money behind those because they re paying you to do the commercial development of the product  to market this to the spacecraft design community  After all  a human mission to Mars may sound like science fiction  but for Blandino it s the future   When the pilgrims came  to the New World  it was about a 60 day journey  It s a little bit longer than that to get to Mars right now  but we re talking about the same magnitude as it took to send the pilgrims to the New World or the colonists to Jamestown    It s not beyond the realm of

engineers at NASA s Langley Research Center is an opportunity not afforded most undergraduates  but four 1st Class cadets under the direction of Col  Joe Blandino  professor of mechanical engineering  have been able to do just that  NASA engineers assisted Luke Butler as he worked on his honors thesis  while Paul Cicero  Kelvin Ulloa  and Victor de Leon completed a year long senior design project  Their work even led to VMI s involvement in a successful proposal resulting in a NASA Phase I Small Business Innovative Research Grant to a computer aided engineering   simulation   company  MotionPort  with which Blandino is collaborating on software design tools for spacecraft hardware   Normally our senior design course is one semester  but the group wanted to work on a project that was more challenging than could be accomplished during the semester  said Blandino   I hope what we can come up with is a well understood and well designed solar array that industry could pick up  integrate into a space craft  and send   off on at least a Mars flyby in the next 10 years  he explained  Solar arrays capture sunlight and turn it into energy for solar electric propulsion   I was six years old when man walked on the moon and the next logical step was   We re heading to Mars  and that never happened    But I think maybe the time is coming where that is going to happen  Blandino continued  The research these cadets completed will be one of thousands of critical pieces in the bigger picture of that mission to Mars   My project was taking the GRA   Government Reference Array   and seeing if it was scalable up to a one megawatt class solar array structure  which means it s going to have to support 5 000 square meters of solar blankets in outer space  said Butler  who is entering the Engineering Science and Mechanics doctoral program at Virginia Tech   Our project focused more on the actual deployable system that they use to deploy the solar blankets as soon as the satellite is launched into space said Ulloa  who commissioned in the U S  Marine Corps   We were taking a closer look at what stresses the hinges and other structures are going to be experiencing during deployment   determining if the keel  primary structural  beams sustained any failures in the hinges  explained Cicero  who commissioned in the U S  Air Force and will continue working in space operations in the Satellite Command and Control division   Langley allowed us to use some of their systems and some of their processing capabilities because the programs we were running   required a lot of processing power  Cicero continued   At VMI  we only have a limited amount  so they were providing a lot more capabilities at our disposal as well as troubleshooting technical help  Last fall  NASA issued requests for proposals under the Small Business Innovative Research program   One of the topics was related to developing software tools for designing future large solar arrays  Blandino explained  Since this is a fairly new area for MotionPort  the company sought out Blandino s expertise  Staff there knew he had been running simulations using the company s software and that he was active in the spacecraft community working on deployable structures   We ll be using the toolboxes they ve developed for their RecurDyn multi body dynamic modeling software  and we ll be giving them feedback as well as providing documentation on the use  Blandino said  VMI will receive three  49 000 licenses for cadet use   We re hoping if this is successful that NASA would choose this for Phase II   there s much more money behind those because they re paying you to do the commercial development of the product  to market this to the spacecraft design community  After all  a human mission to Mars may sound like science fiction  but for Blandino it s the future   When the pilgrims came  to the New World  it was about a 60 day journey  It s a little bit longer than that to get to Mars right now  but we re talking about the same magnitude as it took to send the pilgrims to the New World or the colonists to Jamestown    It s not beyond the realm of possibility  By Daniel Stinnett  07 IR
