Physics   Astronomy   From Mega to Giga From Mega to Giga Research Partnership Could Revolutionize Cell Phone Communication A collaboration currently under way between a VMI physics professor and a private inventor could someday avert a looming crisis in cellular network capacity by speeding up cell phone transmissions  Last year  Col  Stacia Vargas  professor of physics and astronomy  teamed up with Lexington resident Tom Chaffee and his company  Attochron  to develop an application of ultrashort pulse lasers for telecommunications  All lasers emit light  classified as either continuous wave or pulsed  Ultrashort pulse lasers differ from continuous wave lasers in that the light comes in extremely short bursts  or pulses  of roughly less than a millionth of a nanosecond  which is one billionth of a second  Chaffee explained that while interest in using lasers for wireless telecommunications began in the 1960s  continuous wave lasers have proven to be unsatisfactory because fog and clear air turbulence seriously interfere with those lasers  performance  The use of ultrashort pulse lasers  he believes  will circumvent these problems   It s really about how we re using the energy  said Chaffee  In December 2013  Vargas and Chaffee s collaboration got under way in earnest after they received a grant for just under  100 000 from the Commonwealth Research Commercialization Fund  with an equivalent match from Attochron  The CRCF program  which is administered by the Center for Innovative Technology  is a state fund designed to advance  in Virginia  targeted areas of research with commercial promise  With funding secured  Vargas and Chaffee have been hard at work this year in a lab in the basement of Mallory Hall  with assistance from Attochron s chief technology officer of USPL Systems  Dr  Alexandre Braga  of Albuquerque  N M  Together  the three are working to prove that ultrashort pulse lasers could someday complement microwave radios and fiber optics as a means of communication between cell phone towers  Such tower to tower or tower to network communication is known in industry parlance as  backhaul  According to Chaffee  backhaul is in short supply as more and more individuals use their phones to send and receive vast amounts of data such as pictures and video   There s a capacity crunch in backhaul networks  said Chaffee   That s the worldwide number one problem for wireless telecommunications  Fiber optics   laser signals inside glass fiber   can carry vast amounts of data  Chaffee noted  but their installation requires digging  That digging  in turn  requires obtaining permits and dodging infrastructure that may already be underground  By instead sending the lasers through the air  these problems can be avoided entirely   It s kind of like getting the fiber optic capacity without the fiber  observed Chaffee  A typical speed for microwaves  Vargas said  is 100 to 300 megabits per second  while the speed of USP lasers is measured in gigabits per second  There are 1 024 megabits in one gigabit   The big advantage  of going from microwaves to lasers  in wireless communications is going from megabits to gigabits  Vargas commented  By the end of this year  Vargas  Chaffee  and Braga hope to send a modulated ultrashort pulse laser signal with a data rate of at least one gigabit per second between an upstairs classroom in Mallory Hall and the press box in Foster Stadium   On our previous working session in August we sent just the laser pulses  but on Sept  19  we sent a 100 Mbps modulated signal  a new record for Attochron  said Vargas  She explained that a modulated laser signal carries data   and signals used in telecommunications must be able to carry data   Just sending the laser is simple  but sending a modulated signal is much more complicated  Vargas noted  To prove that ultrashort pulse lasers can work in all weather conditions  Vargas and Chaffee are in the process of having a state of the art weather station installed on the roof of Mallory Hall  This includes a fog monitor on loan from the National Science Foundation s University Corporation for Atmospheric Research in Boulder  Colo  a precipitation monitor  for rain and snow  and a weather station telling other details such as barometric pressure  humidity  wind speed and direction  Assisting with this aspect of the project are Lt  Col  Merce Brooke  94  associate professor of physics and astronomy  and Lt  Col  Tim Moore  97  associate professor of civil and environmental engineering  Additional assistance has come from Grigg Mullen III  lab mechanic for physics and astronomy  who helped to mount the telescopes used to send the signal from Mallory Hall to the press box  Both Vargas and Chaffee expressed their appreciation not only to those three individuals  but also to the head of the physics and astronomy department  Col  Tim Hodges  for his ongoing support  Col  John Thompson  who was head of the Department of Physics and Astronomy at the time the collaboration began  to the athletic department for use of the press box  and to members of the information technology department who have helped connect devices used in the experiments  With help from all corners   including many leading vendors who have loaned outright or offered at reduced pricing their hardware for this project   the collaborators are confident they can deliver a product that will revolutionize the wireless telecommunications industry   We re going to demonstrate the link distance and data rates the wireless telecommunications industry wants to see  said Chaffee  By  Mary Price IR   Oct  2014 VMI Foundation Keydet Club Alumni Webcams Directories My VMI  RESOURCES   Title IX  Health   Safety   IT   Site Index Parents
