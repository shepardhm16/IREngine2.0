Physics   Astronomy   Research Accordian Research Research is an important aspect of an undergraduate education in physics and astronomy  and therefore our curriculum includes courses to encourage physics majors to conduct undergraduate research  Second Class physics majors are required to take two one hour courses during which they have the opportunity to work with faculty on an independent research project  At the end of the semester  the project is documented in detail and presented orally to the department  giving students experience in writing scientific papers and in giving oral presentations  The department also encourages physics majors to attend conferences and present their research results  For seniors  a senior thesis is available as an option  Some research topics include  Observational Astronomy Astronomical research at VMI is focused on measuring the polarization of starlight  Recently  a polarimeter was designed and constructed for use with the 0 5 meter  f 13 05 Cassegrain telescope at the VMI observatory 1  The polarimeter is based on the common dual beam design and utilizes a rotatable half wave plate and Wollaston prism to image starlight onto a CCD detector after passing through a broadband  or narrowband  filter  The usable field of view is approximately 10 arcminutes and the operational range of the instrument is 400 nm   700 nm  Measuring the polarization state of starlight can yield information about the interstellar medium  the nature and environment around certain stars  and the magnetic field in our local region of the galaxy  Students have the opportunity to utilize the observatory and its equipment by engaging in undergraduate research and work with Lt  Col  G  A  Topasna  1G  A  Topasna  D  M  Topasna  G  B  Popko   An Easily Designed and Constructed Optical Polarimeter for Small Telescopes  Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific  125  1056  2013  Thin Films and Nanotechnology The Thin Films Lab contains some of the latest scientific instruments  to which physics majors at other schools may not be exposed at the undergraduate level  Students who choose to do undergraduate research in the department s thin films lab will have the opportunity to work with an atomic force microscope  AFM  scanning tunneling microscope  STM  UV VIS NIR spectrophotometer  materials microscope  vacuum evaporation system  and an array of recently purchased electronic instrumentation  Students will have direct  hands on experience with the type of equipment they will be working with once they graduate from VMI  Microscopy The ability to measure the topology  surface characteristics  of thin films is very important in understanding the fundamental nature of a particular material and how that material may play a role in the creation of certain thin film devices  Optical microscopy is one way of seeing details in the surface of materials  Other methods include scanning electron microscopy  atomic force microscopy  and scanning tunneling microscopy  Each method has its advantages and disadvantages  and not all methods are suitable in certain circumstances  The department s thin films lab contains a Zeiss Axioskop 2 materials microscope  This microscope allows us to visually image films in brightfield  darkfield  and polarized light from 50x to 1000x  With the Total Interference Contrast attachment we are capable of measuring step heights with 20 nm precision  The department s thin films lab contains an Atomic Force Microscope  AFM  capable of imaging the surface of materials from 80  m to less than 1  m with a resolution of less than 2 nanometers at the lower end  One nanometer  nm  is 10 9 meters  Atomic force microscopy can be used on all types of solid materials and produces a three dimensional image of the surface  The AFM can operate in either contact or intermittent contact mode  including phase imaging  and can be expanded to include magnetic force microscopy  The scanning tunneling microscope  STM  works by the principle of quantum tunneling and can image the surface of conductors or semiconductors  Spectroscopy The department s thin film lab has a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV VIS NIR spectrophotometer with a 150 mm integrating sphere  6  incident specular reflectance attachment  and slide holder for transmission measurements  The instrument is capable of measuring transmitted and specular reflected light from 175 to 3300 nm  Vacuum Evaporator To deposit thin films in a vacuum environment  the thin films lab has a Ladd 30000 vacuum evaporator  The system uses a diffusion pump with liquid nitrogen and can reach 10 7 Torr  1 Torr   1 mmHg  inside a 12 inch diameter bell jar  Shielded electrodes allow us to deposit solid material either by tungsten boats or filaments  Electrical Characterization To characterize the electrical properties of thin films  the lab is equipped with electronic equipment  These include such instruments as a source measure unit  picoammeter  digital multimeters  power supplies  digital phosphor oscilloscope  and RCL meter  These are new instruments from Keithly  Agilent  and Tektronix and are like the ones graduates will find throughout industry or in graduate school  Miscellaneous Equipment The lab is outfitted with other equipment typically found in a laboratory setting  A fume hood  nanopure water system  spin coater  computers  and data analysis and programming software are but some of the other equipment that students will find available while pursuing undergraduate research at VMI  Research Article  Cadet Researches Polarization Using Thin Films Lasers and Fiber Optics Dr  Thompson s primary areas of research are the physics of pulsed lasers and the interaction of these pulses with glass optical fiber  Much of this work requires the precise control of various properties of the laser pulses  As a result  we work with lasers that we build rather than off the shelf laser systems  Most applications require that these sources of light be very stable  From a fundamental perspective  nature is replete with events or processes that depend in some way on random fluctuations  consequently  what we learn from these experiments may help us think more clearly about natural processes involving randomness  Research Article    Molecular Spectroscopy  Research Article  Tracking Movement to the Microsecond Laser Spectroscopy We perform research projects which entail studying rare earth and transition metal ions doped into crystal host materials using optical and laser spectroscopy  These materials are of interest because of potential applications such as new laser materials and because of some fundamental physical properties  The lab is equipped with a Q switched Nd YAG laser  Spectra Physics GCR 150  with a 10 Hz repetition rate and 650 mJ of energy at the fundamental  1064nm  The laser also has frequency doubling  532nm  and tripling  355nm  capabilities  In addition  we have a continuous wave  air cooled Argon Ion laser and a 30 watt deuterium lamp  We have constructed a pulsed dye laser that is pumped by the Nd YAG laser  We also have KDP frequency doubling crystal for additional wavelength options  We use photomultiplier tubes for detection  We have a Standford Research multichannel scalar average  SR430  for photon counting  We also have a computer controlled monochromator  Acton Research Corp  Cadet Research Projects  Energy Transfer Between Gd3  and Cr3  in GGG Cr3  D  Dunn  98  Holographic Interferometry  D  Hendrix  99  Constructing
